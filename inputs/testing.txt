@@4157841 BORDER WARS # IN DECEMBER , THE MNDEZ REYES FAMILY BECAME the latest in a series of political asylum cases in Montreal that have gained the media 's attention.1 The Canadian government definitively denied refugee status to this Mexican family of four , ordering them to leave the country in three weeks ' time , by mid-January 2013 . The father , Fernando Reyes , affirmed that on three occasions he was kidnapped in Mexico , the third time in the company of his then 11-year-old son . This recurrent violence finally pushed him and his family to seek political asylum in Canada in 2008 . In a final effort to try to influence the government 's decision and to publicly denounce Canadian treatment of Mexican asylum seekers , the family turned to the media to publicize their case . Since October 2011 , when Paula Ortiz was obliged to leave Canada--leaving behind two Canadian-born small children--numerous such cases have received significant media attention . # Such cases have served to illuminate a much broader but largely silent and invisible phenomenon , as thousands of other Mexican asylum seekers have also been forcibly expelled from Canada in recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three major processes : increased North American economic integration ; the transformation in the nature of state and social violence in Mexico ; and radical policy reform that renders political asylum increasingly and durably inaccessible , particularly for peoples from the Global South . # From the early 1990s to 2009 , the number of Mexicans seeking political asylum in Canada steadily and quite dramatically increased . While they numbered about 250 in 1994--the year NAFTA went into effect--their number increased to 3,350 in 2005 , causing Mexicans to become the most common seekers of asylum on Canada ; the yearly petition rate finally reached over 9,000 in 2009 . To definitively counter this " emerging crisis , " in July 2009 , the Canadian government implemented a visa requirement on all Mexicans traveling to Canada . The requirement--expensive , complex , designed to exclude--acts as a legal wall , making it impossible for most Mexicans to reach Canada and preventing them from applying for political asylum once in the country.2 # Without a visa , Mexicans can no longer reach Canada by taking a direct international flight , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 2009 , Mexicans could cross the U.S.-Canada border overland to request asylum . Migrants traveling overland now have to apply for political asylum in the United States . In other words , unauthorized migrants in the United States can not apply for asylum at the Canadian border . The 2009 implementation of the Canadian visa has effectively harmonized the visa policies of the United States and Canada . Acceptance rates for asylum in the United States , however , are much lower than in Canada , and those who cross the border to the United States to seek political refuge are systematically imprisoned . Yet the number of Mexicans seeking asylum in the United States has also increased in recent years . # To justify this legal wall , the Canadian government mobilized potent discourses that sought to categorically and unequivocally undermine the legitimacy and political subjectivity of Mexican asylum seekers . According to the Canadian government , the vast majority of applications were " false " or " bogus . " Drawing on deeply engrained stereotypes , these people were portrayed simply as " economic migrants " seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada . Thus , according to Jason Kenney , Canada 's minister of Citizenship , Immigration and Multiculturalism , they were not in need of state protection and were " abusing " the Canadian asylum policy . He accused Mexican asylum seekers , furthermore , of being " queue jumpers " in the immigration line.3 This argument is also deeply pernicious . Not only does it connote that Mexicans are trying to cheat the system , but it also wrongly implies that they could qualify to migrate to Canada under other means . There are no " queues " available for most Mexicans to jump . Recursively reinforcing and reflecting these discourses , the acceptance rate of petitions for asylum continued to decrease as the number of applicants increased . In the years leading up to and following the imposition of the visa , acceptance rates hovered between 8% and 17%. # Curiously , particular postures from within the Canadian government contradict the overarching position of the Canadian government vis--vis contemporary violence in Mexico , as well as the motivations of Mexican asylum seekers . For example , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens to " exercise a high degree of caution " when traveling to Mexico , discouraging in particular all " nonessential travel " in northern states.4 The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada ( IBRC ) has recognized , furthermore , that certain rejected asylum claimants were under threat of persecution and suffered from " generalized " forms of violence . The IBRC justified denying these individuals refugee status because " generalized violence " does not fall into the types of persecution recognized by the Geneva Convention . This fact calls into question the categories of persecution maintained by the Geneva Convention and not the legitimacy of asylum seekers ' petitions . # When the Canadian government imposed the visa requirement in 2009 , thousands of Mexicans who had applied for asylum were still in Canada awaiting the evaluation of their asylum applications . Since then , we have documented the lives of many of these people in Montreal as they have struggled individually and collectively for the recognition of their rights while seeking to reframe discourses and debates regarding Mexico . Although it is difficult to know for certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of adjudicating the last of the cases from the pre-2009 visa period ; thus , this massive yet largely invisible migration of people is now nearing an end . Examining political asylum from the vantage point of their lives , however , poses crucial questions about the meaning and status of political asylum today , particularly as countries throughout the Global North now use asylum policies as tools for exclusion rather than as instruments for promoting broad humanitarian action.5 # Contrary to the simplistic portrait frequently bandied about by the Canadian government , the research that we have conducted suggests that the causes of this novel but short-lived migratory flow are complex . While economic factors do play a role , reducing Mexican asylum seekers to " economic migrants " is , in our view , deeply prejudicial . According to interviews that we have conducted with asylum seekers , multiple and diverse forms of violence underpinned many people 's life stories , including gendered forms of violence ( directed against both women and homosexuals ) , violence spawned by narco-trafficking and the Mexican government 's recent war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insecurity , and targeted state-sponsored violence against social movement leaders and political and human rights activists . To this list must be added the practices of state impunity . These include direct , often violent acts of retribution against individuals who denounce government officials and members of the police for corruption or other crimes , as well as the generalized lack of police and judicial protection in Mexico , which renders most Mexicans systematically vulnerable to all forms of violence . # Unsurprisingly , and in a mutually reinforcing manner , many of these same individuals have also suffered from acute forms of economic insecurity . Testimonials varied greatly , but many spoke of the difficulty of making ends meet ; the increasing repression against unauthorized migrants in the United States and the violence at the U.S.-Mexico border , which make migration to the United States more difficult ; and the threat to habitual livelihoods with the spread of criminal networks throughout rural Mexico . In this sense , we believe that this migration flow has deeply entwined political and economic causes . Thus , as is the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylum seekers destabilize the hard categorical distinction that the Canadian government seeks to impose on migrants through labels such as political refugees ( and " real " asylum seekers ) or economic migrants ( and " false " asylum seekers ) . Maintaining these strong categorical distinctions represents , in fact , just another state strategy of border enforcement . In contrast to the Canadian government 's characterizations , we believe , from an ethical and analytical viewpoint , that this migration flow might be best categorized as a form of " survival migration , " or mobility caused by an existential threat to the personhood of individuals , families , or communities.6 In other words , multifaceted forms of human insecurity , both political and economic , underpin this mixed migratory flow . # The fact that the political and economic causes of Mexican asylum seeking can be found , at least partially , in processes that operate at the transnational ( or properly North American ) scale , directly linked to the process of North American integration , adds complexity to the situation . The flow of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drug money ; the increasing repression of unauthorized migrants in the United States ; and the destruction of Mexican livelihoods and environments in urban and rural areas linked to neoliberal economic policies , including the very notable presence of Canadian mining companies on Mexican soil , all contribute to the multifaceted forms of violence and the concomitant production of human insecurity that characterize contemporary Mexican society . Three asylum cases with which we are familiar sit clearly at the crosscurrents of these processes : first , a bank teller who was pressured by drug traffickers to launder money , which surely would have filtered into the global financial system ; second , a social movement activist who struggled against a Canadian mining company in San Luis Potosi ; and third , another activist centrally involved in the student movement against privatization at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 2000 . All three were granted asylum , yet the current visa requirement would make similar petitions virtually impossible today . # In addition to recasting how we understand the motivations and causes of asylum seeking among Mexicans , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into question the dominant discourses and practices of the Canadian government regarding asylum . Locally , many of the people with whom we have interacted have been criminalized . Men , in particular , frequently spent time in detention , either upon arrival in Canada or just before the set date of expulsion . Furthermore , almost across the board and regardless of skills or background , asylum seekers have been pushed into the low-wage economy in Montreal . They typically receive wages under the table or work for minimum wage in private homes as domestics , in restaurants , and in factories . The nature of work that asylum seekers performed spoke of exploitation and vulnerability , rather than of individuals who were " abusing " the system . In different ways , both of these trends ( criminalization and informality ) durably blur the line between asylum seekers and clandestine and undocumented workers , further reinforcing the former 's lack of legitimacy . # At the transnational scale , the phenomenon of asylum seeking among Mexicans highlights an emerging pattern of transnational itinerant movement or homelessness in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived with his family as an unauthorized immigrant in the United States , losing his job twice due to raids by immigration officials in the United States . At the church that he frequented , he received advice and aid to apply for asylum in Canada . However , the request was eventually denied . Just before his and his family 's expulsion , Canadian immigration officials detained him , asserting that he was at risk of flight . As stated simply by another family we interviewed who had also lived in all three countries , " We are not wanted anywhere . " Furthermore , upon return to Mexico , many of our contacts felt that they could not return to their previous hometowns or states . For example , a homosexual , whom we shall call David , suffered violence at the hands of a police officer and onetime sexual partner . When he returned to Mexico--he was also detained before being expelled--he believed that he could not go back to his previous home , opting instead to try his chances in a different state . Another notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extortion by the Zetas , a trafficking gang . Unable to pay their " quota " and fearing for their lives , the family applied for asylum in Canada but were turned down because of the " generalized " nature of the violence from which they suffered . When they return , they plan to migrate to a different region in Mexico , with slim hopes of acquiring land there to cultivate . # An increasing number of Mexican asylum seekers choose to stay in Canada clandestinely . Cristina , for example , has made this very difficult and complicated choice . She was a victim of severe sexual violence at the hands of competing narco-trafficking networks . Given this history , she considers the personal bodily safety that she feels in Canada well worth the isolation , invisibility , and illegality of her current situation . In Canada , being clandestine means living fully in the shadows with no access to any state services , such as education or health care . # Taken together , the patterns of mobility highlighted above force us to consider the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and homeless , with no government willing to offer them protection or defend their rights . This idea of " statelessness " was strongly reflected in recent comments made by Mexican president Enrique Pea Nieto while on his pre-inaugural North American diplomatic tour . In a joint press conference in Ottawa given by Pea Nieto and Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper on November 28 , the thorny issue of the visa travel restriction arose . In response , Harper affirmed that " we would ultimately like to see visa-free travel with Mexico , " but that Canada has to complete ongoing reforms to its immigration system before doing so . Pea Nieto responded by stating , " As Mr. Harper said , the visa requirement is the result of excessive refugee claims that were perhaps unfounded--citizens of our country who claim refugee status , which got them access to social security benefits in this country . " 7 Sadly , Pea Nieto 's words simply reinforce and legitimize the Canadian government 's prejudicial posture toward Mexican asylum seekers . # In Canada , the fate of Mexican asylum seekers has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the primary objective of which is to stem the flow of refuge claimants . Perverse as it would seem , Mexico has served as a useful " example " to justify such reforms . The use of a visa requirement , systematically applied to countries of the Global South , combined with the safe third-country agreement with the United States , prevents potential asylum seekers from ever reaching Canadian soil . These legal instruments mean that the Canadian boundary now operates in a partially de-territorialized manner , running through airports and embassies , while increasingly relying on U.S. border enforcement practices as well . # For those people who somehow do manage to arrive in Canada seeking political refuge , the very recent law C-31 , which took effect December 15 , has quite dramatically changed how their cases will be evaluated . Indeed , this law , which has been categorically condemned by immigrant and refugee activists , further undermines the rights of asylum seekers and refugees in multiple ways . According to the Canadian Council for Refugees , the following issues are of particular concern : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for asylum seekers to prepare their cases ; it creates distinct national categories , which will inevitably lead to unequal treatment among asylum seekers from different countries ; it opens the door for prolonged imprisonment ; and it delays the possibility of family reunification for those granted asylum.8 The border is hardening not only externally but internally as well . # 1 .

@@4005241 Controversy exists concerning the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation . The present study used a cross-sectional design to examine social cognitive predictors of creatine use versus non-use among 148 male , undergraduate , recreational resistance trainers . Seventy participants ( 47.3% ) reported creatine use . Creatine users had higher self-efficacy for resistance-training with creatine , t ( 146 ) = 4.98 , p < .001 , higher positive outcome expectancies for improved workout performance , t ( 146 ) = 2.3 7 , p = .019 , and lower negative outcome expectancies for creatine use , t ( 146 ) = 4.90 , p < .001 . No significant differences were found for self-efficacy for resistance training without creatine or negative outcome expectancies for improved workout performance . Logistic regression analysis revealed that social cognitive variables accounted for 25 % of the variance in creatine use . The results lay the groundwork for the understanding of performance enhancing dietary supplement use from a theoretical , social cognitive perspective . <p> Creatine is one of the most popular performance enhancing supplements among college students ( Williams &; Anderson , 2000 ) , and has received recent attention from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 ; Shaifali , 1998 ; Smith , 2000 ) . Despite this popularity , controversy exists concerning the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation ; roughly equal evidence exists supporting positive effects and supporting null effects of supplementation on performance ( Demant &; Rhodes , 1999 ; Graham &; Hatton , 1999 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky , 1998a ; Williams &; Branch , 1998 ) . Numerous anecdotal accounts illustrate adverse side effects , such as kidney dysfunction , effects on the body 's creatine and insulin production , diarrhea , gastrointestinal pain , muscle cramping , and dehydration ( Benzi , 2000 ; Graham &; Hatton , 1999 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky , 1998b ; Poortmans &; Francaux , 2000 ) . In addition , Metzl et al . ( 2001 ) hypothesize that creatine may be a gateway drug to other more harmful performance enhancing substances such as dehydroepiandrosterone ( i.e. , DHEA ) and androstenedione ( i.e. , andro ; King et al. , 1999 ) . <p> Although laboratory studies of creatine 's efficacy are numerous , field studies of creatine supplementation patterns have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resistance trainers , who are the target of marketing strategies that emphasize creatine 's ability to increase body mass ( Benzi , 2000 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky , 1998b ; Poortmans &; Francaux , 2000 ; Williams &; Branch , 1998 ) and appear to be a major consumer group in the creatine market ( Demant &; Rhodes , 1999 ) . Moreover , the present authors found no studies that examine relationships between psychological variables and performance enhancing supplement use in this population . Previous creatine studies have examined expectations ( Labotz &; Smith , 1999 ) and perceptions ( Greenwood et al. , 2000 ; Juhn , O'Kane , &; Vinci , 1999 ; LaBotz &; Smith , 1999 ; Ray et al. , 2001 ; Sheppard et al. , 2000 ; Schilling et al. , 2001 ) of the positive and negative effects of creatine supplementation among users , but have not looked at differences between creatine users and non-users with respect to these psychological variables . Research on steroid use suggests that psychological variables may be important . Lovstakken , Peterson and Homer ( 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with higher risk of steroid use , and negative social expectations associated with lower risk of steroid use among college students . Goldberg et al . ( 1996 ) used a psycho-educational intervention to decrease intentions to use steroids and increase resistance-training self-efficacy in male high school athletes . In working to understand creatine use among recreational weight trainers , the present study examines differences between creatine users and non-users with respect to psychological variables that are theorized to precede behavior . <p> Social cognitive theory ( SCT ; Bandura , 1986 ) provides a useful theoretical framework for understanding creatine use by addressing its specific behavioral , personal , and environmental influences . That is , self-efficacy and outcome expectancies specifically related to the use of creatine can help us understand why some resistance trainers use creatine while others do not . <p> Self-efficacy is defined as belief in one 's ability to take certain actions to produce desired attainments ( Bandura , 1997 ) . In the present study , improvement of resistance-training performance is the attainment , while creatine use is one course of action that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resistance-training self-efficacy is broken down into two components : self-efficacy with creatine , and self-efficacy without creatine . Creatine users are expected to have higher self-efficacy with creatine than non-users . However , according to SCT , use of medications can undermine self-efficacy if successes are ascribed to medication rather than to personal capabilities ( Bandura , 1997 , see p. 274 ) . Therefore , creatine users are expected to have lower self-efficacy without creatine than non-users . <p> Outcome Expectancies -- the positive and negative outcomes expected as a result of producing desired attainments depend on efficacy beliefs and serve as incentives and disincentives for behavior ( Bandura , 1997 ) . In this study , outcome expectancies reflect the interactive relationship between perceived likelihood of outcomes and the subjective values placed on those outcomes ( Bandura , 1997 ; Rodgers &; Brawley , 1991 ) . Specifically , positive and negative outcomes of improved workout performance , as well as negative outcomes directly tied to creatine use are considered . <p> In summary , it is expected that creatine users will have higher self-efficacy with creatine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative outcome expectancies than non-users . In addition , it is expected that social cognitive variables will predict current status as creatine user or non-user . Finally , although no formal hypotheses were tested , descriptive data concerning creatine use patterns , source of information , and use of other performance enhancing dietary supplements was collected in an attempt to further understand creatine use . Method <p> Participants <p> Participants were a convenience sample of 148 male undergraduate students enrolled in psychology courses at a large mid-Atlantic university , recruited via a research recruitment folder containing a brief description of the study and a sign up sheet . Only students who resistance-trained at least twice a week to improve muscle development , gain strength , or increase muscle mass for non-professional purposes were recruited . Creatine was not mentioned in the recruitment folder . Participants earned extra credit in the psychology classes for participating in the study . Participants were excluded from the study if they did not report any resistance training ( n = 2 ) , did not provide complete data ( n = 6 ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; i.e. , non-recreational goal of resistance training ) . Participants had a mean age of 19.37 ( SD = 1.52 ) and a mean BMI of 24.29 ( SD = 3.42 ) . Participants were 75% Caucasian . <p> Procedures <p> Participants met for one hour in a classroom to complete an anonymous questionnaire packet . Instructions were read aloud for each of the individual scales within the packet . In addition , the first item of each scale was read aloud , and further clarification was provided if requested . <p> Measures <p> Background information and supplement use . This questionnaire assessed participant age , height , weight , ethnicity , and intercollegiate sports participation . With respect to creatine use , participants were first asked whether or not they had ever heard of creatine . Next , participants were asked to indicate whether or not they had ever used creatine . Those who had used creatine were asked to indicate the duration of use and the number of cycles of use with at least two weeks between periods of use . Participants were then asked to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatine ) . To encourage truthfulness , participants were asked not to report illegal drug-use . Finally , two items assessing source of information asked participants to identify initial source of information about creatine and source of most information about creatine . <p> Self-efficacy . Items assessing SCT variables were preceded by a single item asking participants to indicate how they determine that their workout performance has improved by completing the sentence : " My workout performance would be improved if ... " Participants were told to refer to this definition of improved workout performance to aid them in responding to the SCT items . <p> Next , participants were asked to respond to one self-efficacy without creatine item : " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance without using creatine ... " and two self-efficacy with creatine items : " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance faster by using creatine ... " and " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance even more by using creatine ... " ( italics in original ) . Participants responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all confident ) to 100 ( extremely confident ) . Because participants were allowed to personally define improved workout performance , multiple item self-efficacy scales were not necessary . Previous studies have shown that single item self-efficacy scales are effective for measuring exercise self-efficacy when the attainment is clearly defined ( Carboni , Burke , Joyner , Hardy , &; Blom , 2002 ; Clark &; Dodge , 1999 ; Clark &; Nothwehr , 1999 ; Desharnais , Bouillon , &; Godin , 1986 ; Sharpe &; Connell , 1992 ) . <p> Outcome expectancies . Participants responded to three types of outcome expectancy items developed with the aid of qualitative data obtained in a pilot study ( Williams &; Anderson , 2000 ) . Positive improved workout expectancies included 17 items reflecting the positive physical , social , and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from attaining improved workout performance . Examples of positive improved workout expectancy items include : " I will increase my muscle strength ... " " I will be admired for my physical appearance ... " and " I will improve how I feel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting the negative physical , social , and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from attaining improved workout performance . Examples of negative improved workout expectancy items include : " I will experience unwanted muscle soreness ... " " My friends will think I am overly obsessed with weight-lifting ... " and " I will discover my performance limitations .... " Finally , Negative creatine use expectancies included 10 items reflecting the negative physical , social and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from the use of creatine . Examples of negative creatine use expectancy items include : " I will experience muscle cramps ... " " My friends will criticize me ... " and " I will feel that I am doing something unnatural to my body ... " <p> Participants were asked to rate the " Likelihood " of each outcome on a scale from 0 ( not at all likely ) to 100 ( extremely likely ) . Before proceeding to the next item , participants were also asked to rate the " Importance " of each outcome on a scale from 0 ( not at all important ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , responses to " Likelihood " and " Importance " questions were multiplied , and the resulting products were divided by 100 to yield an item score ranging from 0 to 100 . All of the outcome expectancy item scores were subjected to principle axis factoring with oblique rotation to investigate the factor structure of the items . Results yielded three factor-based scales that were consistent with the original grouping of the items . Item scores were then averaged for each scale to yield positive improved workout expectancy ( = .91 ) , negative improved workout expectancy ( = .86 ) , and negative creatine use expectancy ( = .82 ) scale scores . Data Analyses and Results <p> Descriptive Statistics and Preliminary Analyses <p> Creatine use . Of 148 participants , 5 ( 3.4 % ) had not heard of creatine , 70 ( 47.3 % ) reported having used creatine at some time , and 78 ( 52.7 % ) reported never having used creatine . Among creatine users 9 ( 12.9 % ) were of minority status , while 28 non-users ( 35.9 % ) were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 ( 28.6 % ) had used it for more than 2 months , 30 ( 42.9 % ) for 1 to 2 months , 11 ( 15.7 % ) for 2 to 4 weeks , 7 ( 10.0 % ) for 1 to 2 weeks , and 2 ( 2.9 % ) for less than I week . With respect to cycles of use , 22 ( 31.4 % ) reported 1 cycle , 19 ( 27.1% ) reported 2 cycles , 14 ( 20.0 % ) reported 3 cycles , 3 ( 4.3 % ) reported 4 cycles , and 10 ( 14.3 % ) reported more than 4 cycles . <p> Source of Information . Sources of first knowledge of creatine and most information about creatine across creatine use are shown in Table 1 . A majority of both creatine users ( n = 48 , 70.6 % ) and non-users ( n = 40 , 60.6 % ) indicated that friends and family was the first source of knowledge about creatine . The highest number of creatine users ( n = 20 , 29.4 % ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatine , while the majority of nonusers ( n = 37 , 55.2 % ) said friends and family was the source of most information about creatine . <p> Use of other performance enhancing supplements . Creatine users used more performance enhancing dietary supplements , other than creatine , than non-users , t ( 146 ) = 5.00 , p < .001 ( Table 2 ) . In addition , a larger proportion of creatine users ( n = 47 , 67.1 % ) than non-users ( n = 21 , 26.9 % ) reported previous use of at least one other performance enhancing dietary supplement , / ( 1 , N = 148 ) = 22.52 , p < .001 . Table 3 displays the types of performance enhancing dietary supplements used by creatine users and non-users . Protein/amino acids were the most often used supplements by both creatine users and non-users . Of 11 participants reporting use of DHEA/andro , 10 ( 90.9 % ) were creatine users . <p> Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies . Mean ratings for self-efficacy and outcome expectancy variables across creatine use are presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which variables should be included in the logistic regression analysis . Creatine users were significantly higher on self-efficacy with creatine than non-users , t ( 146 ) = 4.98 , p < .001 . No significant differences were found between creatine users and non-users for self-efficacy without creatine , t ( 146 ) = .45 , p = .657 . Creatine users had significantly higher positive improved workout expectancies , t ( 146 ) = 2.37 , p = .019 , and lower negative creatine use expectancies , t ( 146 ) = 4.90 , p <.001 , than non-users . No significant differences were found between creatine users and non-users for negative improved workout expectancies , t ( 146 ) = .15 , p=.882 . <p> Sequential Logistic Regression Analysis <p> Based on the preliminary analyses , self-efficacy with creatine , positive improved workout expectancies , and negative creatine use expectancies were included in a sequential logistic regression analysis to predict status as either creatine user or non-user ( Table 4 ) . In accordance with social cognitive theory , self-efficacy with creatine was entered on the first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step ( Bandura , 1997 ) . Goodness-of-fit indices indicated that the model including the social cognitive variables was a better predictor of creatine use status than the constant-only model both on the first step , / ( 1 , N = 148 ) = 22.34 , p < .001 ; and the second step , / ( 3 , N = 148 ) = 39.24 , p < .001 , of the analysis . Strength of association for the model is indicated by correlations between predicted group membership based on the model and actual group membership ( Tabachnick &; Fidell , 2001 , see page 545 ) . The model accounted for 11.6 % of the variance in creatine use status on step one ( r = .34 ) , and 25.0 % of the variance in creatine use status on step two ( r = .50 ) . <p> The Wald statistic tests each logistic regression coefficient ( ) to determine whether or not each variable contributes uniquely to the model ( Table 4 ) . Results indicate that self-efficacy with creatine contributed uniquely to the model on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectancies also contributed uniquely to the model on step two ; however , positive improved workout expectancies did not . For those variables that contribute uniquely to the model , odds ratios provide a more easily interpretable index of the magnitude of each variable 's unique contribution . Prior to calculating odds ratios , the predictor variables were converted to standard scores . Thus , odds ratios reflect the increase/decrease in the odds of creatine use status given a change in one standard deviation in the predictor variable , controlling for all other variables in the model ( Table 4 ) . On step one the odds ratio indicated that participants were 2.36 times as likely ( 136 % more likely ) to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in self-efficacy with creatine . On the second step , the odds ratio for self-efficacy with creatine decreased to 1.91 , indicating that some of the shared variance between self-efficacy with creatine and creatine use status was also accounted for by the outcome expectancy variables . The odds ratio for negative creatine use expectancies indicated that participants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in negative creatine use expectancies . Discussion <p> Consistent with SCT , creatine users had stronger beliefs in personal ability to enhance performance through creatine use . In addition , participants were 2.36 times as likely to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in self-efficacy with creatine . Self-efficacy with creatine continued to be a significant predictor of creatine use status after the outcome expectancy variables were added to the model , thus supporting the notion that self-efficacy continues to be a strong predictor even after outcome expectancies are controlled ( Bandura , 1997 ) . Creatine non-users did not have higher self-efficacy without creatine than creatine users . Instead , mean values for self-efficacy without creatine were high for both groups , suggesting that participants were all fairly confident that they could improve personal workout performance without creatine . <p> Negative creatine use expectancies had the strongest relationship with creatine use status among the outcome expectancy variables .

Moreover , the increase in explained variance from step 1 to step 2 indicates that outcome expectancies explained unique variance in creatine use that was not accounted for by self-efficacy . Creatine users expected more positive outcomes as a result of improved workout performance and valued those outcomes more than non-creatine users . However , positive improved workout expectancies were not a significant predictor of creatine use status when self-efficacy and negative outcome expectancies were controlled . Finally , negative improved workout expectancies were not related to creatine use status . Instead , the mean for this variable was relatively low across all participants indicating that resistance trainers do not expect many negative outcomes of improved workout performance . <p> Descriptive results indicate pervasive exposure to creatine in this population as evidenced by the percentage of those who had heard of creatine ( 96.6 % ) and the rate of use ( 47.3 % ) . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male , undergraduate , recreational resistance-trainers participated in varsity high school sports and obtained information about creatine from athletic trainers ( Williams &; Anderson , 2000 ) , the present data suggest that information about creatine is more often obtained through friends and family or through magazines than through professionals such as athletic trainers . Information gleaned from these sources may become distorted or exaggerated leading consumers to make decisions about creatine use that are not based in fact . Exaggerated claims of the effectiveness of creatine may indirectly affect creatine use by influencing self-efficacy and outcome expectancies . Finally , creatine users had used more performance enhancing supplements than non-creatine users , and more creatine users than non-users reported previous use of more harmful supplements , namely DHEA and andro ( King et al. , 1999 ) . <p> The present study lays the groundwork for the understanding of performance enhancing dietary supplement use from a theoretical , social cognitive perspective .

Although social cognitive variables are theorized to determine future behavior , current self-efficacy judgments and outcome expectancies are based in part on past behavior ( Bandura , 1997 ) ; therefore , to more clearly understand how self-efficacy , outcome expectancies , and information sources influence behavior ( i.e. , creatine use ) , longitudinal designs are preferred . Moreover , the use of a convenience sample in the present study limits the generalizability of the findings . Research employing random and broader sampling ( e.g. , high school students , college graduates , and female resistance trainers ) is needed to understand how SCT operates to influence creatine use in these populations . Finally , as the market for dietary supplements continues to grow , more research is needed that examines theoretical determinants of a wide range of supplement use , including more harmful performance enhancing drugs .

@@4080541 My wife sleeps late . Even without jet lag and the hard work of shuttling from city to city on a book tour in Italy , she enjoys what sleep she can bribe from Morpheus with offerings of Ambien . Last October , as she slumbered , I drove our rental car along the western shore of Lake Como to Ossuccio , a tiny hill town known for its Sacro Monte , or sacred mountain , where 14 pilgrimage buildings are inhabited by life-sized wood-and-plaster figures re -- creating events in Christ 's life . I had become interested in these Sacri Monti scattered throughout pre-Alpine Italy " after reading an essay by the 19th-century British novelist Samuel Butler , who championed them as a neglected alternative to the aft we think of as quintessentially Italian : that of Florence , Venice , Rome , The roads were less congested in early morning , but it was still a relief to leave the garish tourist excrescences near the lake and navigate the narrow switchbacks up and back into time . I parked the car near the base of the hill and hoofed it , like generations of pilgrims before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work for one 's salvation , not stroll down a garden path . Being oblivious , or American , I did it wrong . A tiny tractor pulling rocks pointed the way , and I set off up the cobbled path , deciding I would peek into the enclosed dioramas on the way back down . This meant I distorted the design , but not being Catholic , or even Christian , perhaps I was just feeling rebellious . Passing a church doubtless intended as the culmination of the pilgrimage , I kept going , and the climb became really steep , in places about a 40-degree slope . Try doing that , even in a tractor . I assumed that more small shrine buildings lay ahead deep in the beautiful forest . Sheepishly , I turned back only when I came across a cardboard sign reading Vendesi tacked to a tree , realizing anything " For Sale " could n't be that holy . But it was one of those mornings when everything was bathed in metaphor , so the idea of a child of the transcendentalists leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt apt , as did that For Sale sign as my reward . On the way down I saw the shrines in reverse , ending up in the cradle rather than in resurrected glory . The weathered 17th-century figures , open to the air but guarded by metal grilles , were set against nearly ruined frescoes stacked on an almost inaccessible hill . Many of them were being restored . Their hands and heads were wrapped in plastic to protect them from the elements , and scaffolds held up angels born to fly . Perfect . Somehow , the repairs added to the figures ' poignancy and made what was already a grand cycle of installation art wonderfully accessible . To have adventures like these is why we leave our own shores . A student of mine , on hearing my description of another experience like it , said , " Not everyone gets to go to Europe . " True , and given the trajectory of the dollar , many may never get the privilege . This same student had been told by one of my colleagues that art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid Europe as the home of used-tip and irrelevant brown paintings . I have different ideas about Europe , especially Italy , although today Michelangelo would scarcely recognize his native Florence , infected by traffic and surrounded by rampant growth . I complained to a friend that the Assisi of 40 years ago had seemed like a ship in a sea of pasture land , whereas it now feels like a fort surrounded by a besieging army of tire stores . " Yon should have been there in 1956 , " he said . Eighteen fifty-six would have been even better . Or 1756 . That was when wealthy northern aristocrats all took the Grand Tour through Italy . Artists flocked there to study their patrimony ; some , like Nicolas Poussin in the 17th century , traveled to Rome and stayed . What can today 's young artists get from such a Grand Tour ? Can they see through Berlusconi 's Italy to that of the Medici ? What can they learn ( or steal ) from Italian art ? That visit to Assisi was on my first trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend , fresh out of college , where I had majored in rioting , I was not sure what to do with my life . Historian ? Actor ? We visited a nameless church in Venice ( nameless to us -- it was San Zaccaria ) , put one of our few coins in the luminoso , and my life changed , or so it seems to me now . A sumptuous altarpiece flashed in front of me like a conversion experience , and when the light went out I would have robbed the mendicant at the church door of her coins to see Giovanni Bellini 's gorgeous visual feast again . The revelation led to graduate art school back in the States , then two years of teaching , as I , all the while , champed at the bit to get hack to Italy . Next time , I stayed for four bittersweet months , during which I saw things so profound that they made the Western tradition in art feel utterly daunting to a young artist . I had studied with artists immersed in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 20th century . But what do you do in the face of Italy 's sheer , serf-evident , overpowering genius ? You cower and do your best . You study not the look of great works but their underlying metaphoric structure , how their sophisticated feel for form becomes their content . The Annunciation as an article of faith means little to me , but in a painting of it I observe two figures , structured as simply as AB : one earthbound , feminine , passive ; the other an alternate way of being , some embodiment of mystery . Where in the painting 's space are the figures , near or far , and what happens to the space in between ? Compositional inventions , pictorial intelligence , spatial subtlety : all become an autodidact 's treasure trove . In the hundreds of paintings of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise , who ca n't relate to the tragedy of their loss ? Again we can see an AB structure , with A as a dream of perfection and B as harsh reality . Representations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , then crowds . Giotto and Masaccio introduce a world of gravity , of human responsibility and consequence . We do n't need to paint images of Christ to see a Fra Angelico , a Piero della Francesca , or a Caravaggio as an example of a quality we can aspire to , even knowing the odds are against us . We engage in a conversation with people whose visual thinking we can comprehend . On an ideal Grand Tour , we would set out to see Italian art in its temporal sequence . Start with Greek art , from the archaic to the Hellenistic , which served as the model for most art of the Roman Empire . Follow Roman art 's trajectory from sophistication to blocky simplification to bug-eyed crudity as the empire fell . See how Nicola and Giovanni Pisano in sculpture and Giotto and Duccio in painting resuscitate the tradition in the 1300s . Put yourself in their shoes . We tend to read art backward , as if the choices made at any given moment are determinist necessities , but , over the centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists have had to cut some Gordian knot . Giovanni Pisano looked carefully at Roman sarcophagi . But what did Giotto look at ? Leaving aside the power of individual genius , we can simplify our options down to those of culture and nature . Dig up your ancestral precedents , sometimes quite literally : you can see what Michelangelo learned from the excavated Belvedere Torso , now in the Vatican Museum . Rethink the lessons of our inheritance , our culture . Turn to nature and look more carefully , finding orders previously neglected . Draw from life . The first art historian , Giorgio Vasari , felt that his hero Michelangelo had perfected art , outperformed the past , and conquered nature . This view prevailed for roughly half a century before artists began to question Vasari 's assumptions . We could benefit from a similar scrutiny of today 's art world 's beliefs . Continuing our Grand Tour , we would eventually come across the Carracci brothers and their cousin from Bologna . These three provincials believed the way out of art 's cul-desac involved searching their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and in so doing , they helped reinvigorate Italian art . If their solution called for an immersion in culture , Caravaggio turned once again to the very careful study of nature . Such bursts of wonder seem inevitably bracketed by slumps : time and again , artists have found themselves in a barren field wondering how to revivify art . Moments of great fertility alternate with drought . Bursts of energy are followed by exhaustion . As our tour continues , the Baroque itself becomes conventionalized , and we wander disconsolate through acres of 18th- and 19th-century Italian art . Yes , little seeds can be found in the chaff , and " occasionally even full-blown glories like Tiepolo . But rather than considering the tradition monolithic , we might imagine it as composed of the work of talented individuals . Artists can add to this vast collection . Auguste Rodin cut his own Gordian knot , the moribund Beaux Arts naturalism of his time , by rethinking Michelangelo 's emotional distortions of form . A multinational generation followed with rebellions of their own , from Romania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sequence is carried in the serious artist 's head . Interested in figurative sculpture ? Go to Munich 's Glyptotech , Athens 's Acropolis museum , Rome 's Termini . Draw Bernini 's angels in Rome , study Giambologna 's spiral Sabine women in Florence , or spend time there in the Marino Marini museum . That 's essentially what Marini himself did , and if your ambition is to add to this vast corpus , consider doing the same , weak dollar or no . On our recent trip , my wife and I dropped friends off at Malpensa airport in Milan and rocketed north to Castiglione Olona , home to an intimate but fabulous room of frescoes painted by Masolino in 1435 . I had always wanted to see them , but by the time I screeched to a halt -- abandoning my longsuffering spouse and running uphill yet again -- the doors were closing for that day and the next . I begged breathlessly in broken Italian to be let in . I was , if only for a few minutes , which proved hardly sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from despair . Then it was time to find a hotel . The autostrada in the Po Valley seemed interchangeable with the New Jersey Turnpike west of New York City , and as we searched for accommodations , we grew more and more depressed by the drabness of the landscape . We ended up in Varese , where the next morning , as my wife slept , I decided to squeeze in another Sacro Monte . The path , 10 times wider than the one at Ossuccio , was built to accommodate the carriages of Italian nobility . The houses thinned as I drove on , once again gaining altitude and venturing back in time . On this trip I peered into the 14 chapels in order . Here I found sophisticated terra-cotta figures instead of gesso and wood , and well-preserved frescoes were integrated as backdrops , though the glass behind the iron grilles made them feel less immediate . This was a different , experience from Ossuccio , and my response was more thoughtful than emotional . What some have called the theatrical in visual art fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried called for self-sufficient , freestanding art objects , a variation on art for art 's sake . Viewed from their perspective , a good deal of world art became suspect , even such triumphantly emotional works as Bernini 's Saint Teresa in Rome 's Cornaro Chapel , where we watch the saint 's ecstasy along with marble observers , as if at a small theater . Italy 's Sacri Monti would have given Greenberg a coronary . They leak over into life rather than standing aloof as pure form . He believed that art should aspire to the purest distillation of its material nature , so that painting needed to assert its flatness and sculpture had to be self-contained , calling attention to its materials as , say , bronze , clay , or steel . The Sacri Monti installations would be , for Greenberg , a sentimental mishmash straining the very definition of art . I , too , am drawn to sculpture in the round that defines its own space , musically stating and varying its own internal rhythms . Michelangelo himself believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after being rolled down a hill . In the past , having unknowingly absorbed Greenberg 's prejudices , I might have disdained these Sacri Monti , but in Varese I was moved and intrigued . The sculptors were n't Michelangelo or Bernini ( who is ? ) , but they believed passionately in their local way of doing things . They wanted us to feel present at the Crucifixion , implicating us morally as we mingle with the crowd mocking or mourning Christ . The Sacri Monti embrace theatricality , purposely blurring the border between art and life , immersing us as participants in the work rather than treating us as appreciative spectators . They reject the kind of subtle homogenization that threatens today 's world art ( it seems to me that galleries and contemporary art museums everywhere are filled to bursting with sameness ) . The Sacri Monti remind us of difference , specificity , and contextual thinking . That may be , for me , the best reason to look for the needle in the haystack . In 1977 I was lucky enough to find such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15th-century Madonna del Parto in its original location in a tiny cemetery in Monterchi . I had to bribe the caretaker , who pulled aside the gates to reveal a reassuring image of maternal care melded with geometric certainty . I felt like a Quattrocento pilgrim having a private communion in a near state of nature , surrounded by the gravestones of other mendicants . On a subsequent visit , however , I was disappointed to learn that the Madonna had been moved and imprisoned in the white walls of a museum . It takes time and even work to glean the wheat from the chaff , but what else makes life rich ? At my age , depleted by the massive effort of travel , it makes me want to go home and create something I can believe in . Something that reminds me of the truly great , if sadly rare , things I have seen : things that become less physically accessible but live in my memory as a goal and an inspiration .

@@4019941 The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ( NCLB ) is without peer in the annals of federal education legislation . Prior to the passage of NCLB , no law had ever inserted the U.S. Department of Education directly into the sacrosanct areas of state and local responsibility for ensuring student achievement , using research-validated practices , and dictating the qualifications of our nation 's teachers . Teacher quality and the " highly qualified " standard is at the forefront of the NCLB promise ( some would say " threat " ) that all students will learn more than they are currently learning ; if not , schools and teachers will be held accountable for their failure . As a means to increase student achievement and hold teachers more accountable , NCLB applies pressure to every sector of the education community . Nowhere has that pressure been felt more than in special education programs for students with high incidence disabilities in rural areas where one-third of the nation 's school districts are located . <p> The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current status of the federal requirements for highly qualified special education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As adopted in NCLB and the newly reauthorized Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act ( IDEA 04 ) , we analyze the impact of the highly qualified standard on recruitment and preparation of special education teachers in rural areas and address alternative approaches for meeting federal requirements . The Federal View of a Highly Qualified Special Education Teacher <p> Signed into law in 2001 , NCLB was very explicit about what constitutes a " highly qualified " elementary or secondary teacher . An individual is considered highly qualified if he or she has obtained full state certification/licensure , or successfully passed a state 's teacher licensing examination . A highly qualified teacher is certified or licensed to teach in a given state and must not have had state requirements waived on an emergency , temporary , or provisional basis . New elementary teachers must hold a bachelor 's degree and demonstrate subject knowledge and teaching skills in basic elementary school curriculum , including but not limited to , reading , writing and mathematics . Subject matter competency and teaching skills must be measured by " a rigorous state test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bachelors degree and demonstrate a high level of competency in the academic subjects they teach . Subject matter competence must be measured by " a rigorous state subject matter test , " or by completing an undergraduate major in the subject area , a graduate degree , or by completing coursework equivalent to an undergraduate academic major . <p> Effective 2002-2003 , the law required that all new Title I teachers must have met the above requirements . Additionally , a state 's Title I plan must include measurable objectives to ensure that all teachers providing instruction in " core subjects " ( such as English , math , science , social studies , foreign languages , or art ) meet the highly qualified definition by the end of the 2005-2006 school year . Qualifications for veteran teachers were also specified in statute . Veteran teachers must hold at least a bachelors ' degree and be held to the same standard as new elementary , middle , and secondary teachers . They may , however , demonstrate their competence in the teaching of academic subjects based on " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ( For more information on HOUSSE criteria , See U.S. Department of Education 2004 , The Secretary 's Third Annual Report on Teacher Quality . ) <p> Although explicit regarding the expectations for elementary and secondary teachers , NCLB requirements to be a " highly qualified " special education teacher were nowhere to be found . In fact , it was n't until December of 2002 that the Department of Education promulgated federal regulations that were intended to clarify that the standard really does apply to all teachers , including special educators ( 34 CFR Part 200 , December 2 , 2002 ) . As per the federal rule , any special education teacher who directly instructs students on core academic subjects must meet the highly qualified standard . However , the rule further stipulated that any special educator who is not directly instructing students with disabilities in core academic subjects , or who is only providing consultation to teachers who are highly qualified , did not have to meet the same subject-matter competency requirements under NCLB . In other words , some special education teachers would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of whether they held full state certification/licensure or had successfully passed a state 's teacher licensing examination . Schools received additional policy guidance from the Department of Education on special education teachers and the highly qualified standard in September 2003 . This policy stated that any special education teacher who is providing instruction in core academic subjects must be highly qualified in each subject , regardless of the instructional setting . <p> In November 2004 , Congress passed H.R. 1350 , the Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act ( herein referred to as IDEA 04 ) . A major purpose in amending IDEA 97 was to align current law with the accountability provisions in NCLB , including what it means to be a highly qualified special education teacher . IDEA 04 states that the term " highly qualified " has the same meaning as applied to elementary , middle , and secondary teachers in NCLB ( H.R. 1350 Section 602 10AJ ) . This means that new and veteran special education teachers at the elementary level must have subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading , writing , mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New and veteran special education teachers at the middle and secondary level must have subject knowledge and teaching skills in academic subjects in which the teacher has responsibility for instruction ( teacher of record ) . <p> Specifically , IDEA 04 requires that special education teachers must hold a bachelors degree and " . obtain full State certification as a special education teacher ( including certification obtained through alternative routes to certification ) or passed the State special education teacher licensing examination . " ( H.R. 1350 Section 602 10Bi ) . As is true with elementary and secondary teachers , highly qualified special education teachers must not have had their certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency , temporary , or provisional basis . <p> In addition to the above requirements , special education teachers who are teaching core academic subjects " exclusively to children who are assessed against alternate achievement standards " must meet the same requirements as highly qualified elementary teachers unless the instruction is " above the elementary level . " In that case , the special education teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran special education teachers who teach two or more subjects at the middle or secondary level must also meet the applicable requirements in NCLB . New special education teachers who teach multiple subjects must be highly qualified in one subject area ( mathematics , arts , or science ) and will have two years from the date of employment to demonstrate competence in the additional core academic subjects they teach by passing a state 's HOUSSE or meeting NCLB content requirements . Veteran special education teachers at the middle or secondary level who teach multiple subjects must also demonstrate competence in all core academic subjects they teach by passing a state 's HOUSSE or meeting NCLB content requirements . However , these teachers are not provided a two-year grace period to demonstrate competence in the core academic subjects they teach . <p> Finally , there is no statutory language in IDEA 04 regarding special education teachers who only provide consultative services to a highly qualified teacher . However , report language for H.R. 1350 clarifies it is the intent of Congress that special education teachers in consultative roles be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Section 602 . Applying the Highly Qualified Standard to Rural Special Education Teachers in High Incidence Areas <p> Several factors must be considered in examining the impact of the highly qualified standard for rural special education teachers working in high incidence areas . First and foremost is the need to ensure that all students with a disability in rural schools have access to special education teachers who are able to meet their unique instructional needs as required by IDEA . On this point , there is considerable disagreement among educators as to whether NCLB 's highly qualified standard is synonymous with the concept of " high quality . " As stated by Brownell , Sindelar , Bishop , Langley , and Seo ( 2002 ) , the NCLB emphasis for general educators is on a thorough knowledge of the content being taught and the verbal ability to deliver that content . It is not on pedagogy . The need to shift from pedagogy to content knowledge and verbal ability is a central theme in the first annual Secretary of Education 's Report on Teacher Quality ( U.S. Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedagogically-oriented courses and student teaching experiences within colleges of education are not requisites for becoming an effective teacher . This position is reinforced in the Title II requirements of the Higher Education Act ( HEA ) . Title II requires that states must have in place requirements for content-specific bachelor 's degrees and assessments that measure prospective teacher 's academic content knowledge . In the third annual report on teacher quality , the Secretary of Education reiterates that " overall , state progress in raising standards for prospective teachers is mixed , and significant barriers still exist for teachers pursuing traditional routes to certification and licensure . " ( U.S. Department of Education , 2004 ) . <p> The disproportionate emphasis on content knowledge as espoused within NCLB and by the Secretary of Education runs contrary to the views of many special education professionals . Special education as a field is based on pedagogical expertise , including " continuously assessing student performance , adapting curricula to individual needs , modifying instructional approaches , using positive behavioral interventions , and selecting and implementing appropriate accommodations to facilitate access to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children ( TED ) , 2004 , p. 1 ) . In espousing this view , HECSE and TED argued that any application of the highly qualified standard to special educators should take into account the importance of pedagogical expertise in meeting the instructional needs of students with disabilities . They strongly suggested that any new provisions in IDEA that allowed special education teachers to become fully licensed or certified by simply passing a content knowledge test " would not be sufficient to meet the diverse needs of students with disabilities . " Special educators must demonstrate their specialized knowledge and skills in actual field settings . ( HECSE/ TED , 2004 ) . Obviously , Congress rejected the HECSE/TED recommendation and provided an option in IDEA 04 whereby an individual with a bachelor 's degree and no field experience can become a highly qualified special education teacher by simply passing a state licensing exam . <p> A second factor to consider in examining the impact of the highly qualified standard on rural schools is the critical shortage of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menlove and Lignugaris/Kraft ( 2004 ) report that while special education teacher shortages are critical nationwide , they are " most critical in rural areas of the country " ( p. 18 ) . Thurston and Sebastian ( 1996 ) suggest that an entire small school district can be jeopardized by the lack of a qualified special education teacher and that filling these positions in rural areas is often more problematic than in urban areas . Rural districts often have yearly attrition rates in excess of 30% and may experience a 100% turnover within three years ( Williams , Martin , &; Hess , 2002 ) . <p> Given the existing crisis in the number of qualified rural special education personnel , a logical question is whether the implementation of the IDEA 04 " highly qualified " standard will help or further exacerbate the problem ? The issue is complex and dependent upon several interacting variables , including service delivery options in small school districts ( particularly at the secondary level ) and alternative teacher preparation programs that maintain quality while facilitating access to a career in special education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural areas , subject matter competence for special educators will be particularly burdensome in secondary schools where a teacher may be responsible for most , if not all , core academic subjects for students in high incidence disability areas . Given that rural areas are already facing the most critical special education teacher shortages nationwide ( Menlove &; Lignugaris/Kraft , 2004 ) , the additional subject matter requirements could easily become a further disincentive to a career in the field . A potential way around this disincentive is to modify service delivery . As addressed earlier , the IDEA 04 requirement for subject matter competency applies only to special education teachers who have the responsibility for instruction ( teacher of record ) and not to " consultative teachers . " As such , rural districts may choose to use special educators more in a consultative role in which they work directly with or support highly qualified general education teachers who have subject matter competence . This option alleviates the need for highly qualified special educators to become proficient in multiple subject areas and is consistent with the view that pedagogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , etc ) is the hallmark of an effective special education teacher . However , if rural schools choose to modify service delivery and use special educators in consultative roles , they must also ensure that every student 's instructional program meets the requirement for a free and appropriate education ( FAPE ) in the least restrictive environment . Meeting the Highly Qualified Challenge : Alternative Routes ( AR ) to Teacher Preparation <p> In aligning IDEA with NCLB , Congress continued its emphasis on alternatives to traditional teacher preparation as a strategy to reduce teacher shortages . As suggested by the U.S Department of Education ( 2003 ) , states may " streamline their certification processes and . target talented people who would be turned off by traditional preparation . " The logic underlying this strategy seems to apply best to shortages of math and science teachers . It holds that content mastery and verbal ability are more important to effective teaching than is training in pedagogy . By eliminating formal requirements , it is argued , we may recruit into teaching scientists , engineers , accountants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by teacher preparation . Although the issue of whether this logic is borne out by research need not be addressed here , suffice to say that it has been hotly contested ( see Darling-Hammond &; Ducommun , 2001 ; Progressive Policy Institute , 2001 ; The Abell Foundation , 2001 ) and that math and science educators have questioned its validity , even within those disciplines . They cite the importance of pedagogical content knowledge and the problems some untrained novice teachers experience in representing what they know in ways that are meaningful to children and adolescents ( cf. , Nathan &; Petrosino , 2003 ) . <p> In special education , the logic fits poorly . For one thing , our field is not a content area in the same sense as math and science . There is no source of prospective special education teachers who , like scientists and mathematicians , have special education content expertise , and , it is unclear what population of prospective teachers this strategy would tap . Second , as argued before , in teaching students with disabilities , pedagogical expertise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is an essential element of a special education teachers ' repertoire of skills , knowledge , and dispositions . Nonetheless , NCLB policy promoting fast-track teacher preparation has been extended to special education ( and elementary education ) , and special education alternative preparation is a growth industry . <p> Although alternative route ( AR ) programs differ from one state to the next ( and even within states ) , the defining characteristic of AR programs is access to a teaching credential that bypasses conventional college and university preparation requirements ( Hawley , 1992 ; Zeichner &; Schulte , 2001 ) . AR programs are best viewed as existing on a continuum ranging from abbreviated , fast-track training ( of the NCLB ilk ) to more conventional training that builds on participants ' life experiences ( Hillkirk , 2000 ) . Typically , what makes a program alternative is the length and structure of the program , how the program is delivered , and the characteristics of the participants ( Rosenberg &; Sindelar , 2001 ) . AR programs are often shorter than traditional programs and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is facilitated by intensive field-based instruction and feedback . Eschewing much of the pedagogical coursework typical of most traditional initial preparation programs , AR programs emphasize enhanced supervision of candidates who receive on-the-job training as classroom teachers . It is believed that on-the-job training substitutes for the pedagogical training required by traditional programs ( Leal , 2004 ) . Finally , because AR programs are designed to supplement supply , they should ( and do ) recruit different types of teacher candidates than traditional programs : higher proportions of males , persons over 25 , members of culturally and linguistically diverse groups , and people who have had business and military experience ( Shen , 2000 ) . Finding a population of trainees is important for rural school districts because a program may be tailored to an idiosyncratic homegrown population . As we shall see , homegrown trainees are more likely to be committed to remaining in their communities and addressing the challenges of teaching in rural schools . <p> There has been rapid growth in AR programs , in both general and special education . Feistritzer , Haar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 persons have been licensed as teachers through AR programs . Currently , 43 states plus the District of Columbia ( DC ) offer AR programs ; in 1983 , by contrast , only 8 states offered such programs . Currently , in special education , 36 states and DC offer 225 programs , over 92% of which lead to generic special education certificates . Nationally , California ( 32.8% ) and Texas ( 16.6% ) account for most programs ( Rosenberg , Boyer , Sindelar , &; Misra , 2003 ) . Over 15% of currently certified special education teachers earned it through an AR ; among those who are unlicensed and seeking certification , 24% are enrolled in AR programs ( Connelly , 2003 ) . <p> Three overlapping factors have contributed to the growth of AR programs in special education . First and foremost is the continuing shortage of qualified teachers . Currently , over 50,000 special educators are less than fully certified for their work , and they are responsible for more than 800,000 students with disabilities ( U. S. Department of Education , n.d. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most notably college and university degree programs , are unable to meet the demand for qualified teachers , and alternative routes are most common in states with significant shortages . In California , Texas , Georgia , and Louisiana , four states with large numbers of special education AR programs , shortages average 20.2% ; by contrast , in states that offer no AR programs , shortages average 5.76% ( Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) . <p> Second , many AR programs have proven successful in increasing the number of teachers from culturally and linguistically diverse ( CLD ) groups . Over 86% of special education teachers and those in the traditional preparation pipeline are White , while the student population requiring special education services is approximately 38% nonwhite ( Tyler , Yzquierdo , Lopez-Reyna , &; Flippin , 2002 ) . AR programs help address the need for greater diversity in the teaching force by recruiting a higher percentage of CLD teachers than traditional training programs ( Connelly , 2003 ) . Moreover , of particular relevance to those in rural areas , those trained in AR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools where CLD students make up the majority ( Shen , 2000 ) . <p> The third factor contributing to the proliferation of AR programs is the strident criticism of the education establishment that questions the validity and usefulness of what is termed an over-regulated , self-serving , and exclusionary system of teaching preparation and licensure ( Goldhaber , 2004 ; Thomas B. Fordham Foundation , 1999 ) . These sentiments , also present in the language of NCLB , reflect the view that the education establishment mandates too many pedagogically based requirements in its training programs and that such requirements discourage talented , highly verbal , well-educated , liberal arts graduates from entering teaching . Although viewed by some as a means of de-professionalizing teaching ( Berry , 2004 ; Cochran-Smith &; Fries , 2001 ) , these criticisms have propelled many states to empower multiple providers to open a variety of paths to teaching . Not surprisingly , large numbers of individuals who have had limited contact with schools of education have entered the teaching force . <p> What we know about AR programs in special education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher preparation programs generally , no less about how alternative routes might compare to traditional preparation . Only recently has systematic information on special education AR programs begun to accumulate . Based upon a review of the few empirical studies of AR programs , Rosenberg and Sindelar ( 2001 ) concluded that for such efforts to be successful , there must be ( a ) meaningful school/university cooperation with time allocated to sustain partnerships ; ( b ) instructional content that is substantive , rigorous , and programmatic ; and ( c ) substantial use of on-site supervision and mentoring incorporating both university supervisors and building-based coaches . In an analysis of 101 current programs , we ( Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) found that most programs ( 71% ) involve partnerships among universities , state departments of education , and school districts . For the most part , these programs deliver instruction through a mix of university coursework , district-sponsored professional development , supervised fieldwork , and distance education . Financial support is provided through stipends and salaries , and programs are attracting non-traditional populations to the profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is great variability in the length and intensity of AR programs . Nearly half ( 45.3% ) of current programs require less than 3 months of preparation before trainees enter the classroom as teachers of record , and nearly 13% require no training at all . About 30% of the programs require no more than 18 months to complete , but most ( 60% ) require 19 to 36 months . Thus , while many programs offer adequate support , many rush candidates into challenging teaching situations with little preparation and few requirements for on-going professional development . Because of the potential for high attrition , fast-track programs may fail to increase the supply of special educators over the long term , thus exacerbating critical shortages by consuming limited training funds ( Billingsley , 2003 ; Katsiyannis , Zhang , &; Conroy , 2003 ; Miller , Brownell , &; Smith , 1999 ) . <p> Designing AR programs for rural schools . Rural districts face particular challenges in recruiting teachers , and their small and declining populations are an important element of the problem . In recent research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Wyckoff ( 2003 ) found that beginning teachers were highly likely to return to schools near their home towns . In that state , from 1998-99 to 2001-2002 , over 80% of beginning teachers took jobs within 40 miles of the high schools they attended . This phenomenon works to the advantage of larger districts with high proportions of high school graduates who go on to college . It works to the disadvantage of very small districts , where small numbers of high school graduates go on to college - and presumably even smaller numbers complete professional preparation and come home to teach . ( It also works to the disadvantage of large urban districts , where smaller than expected percentages of high school graduates go on to college . ) In rural districts , subsidizing the college education of local high school graduates in exchange for a promise of completing teacher preparation and returning home to teach seems like a promising policy strategy . However , the cost of subsidizing college education may be more than most districts can afford , and although statewide programs are commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knapp , 2001 ) , service requirements typically stipulate that recipients teach in the state - but not necessarily in high needs schools . <p> The initial cost of providing a highly qualified teacher should not be the only consideration in deciding on how best to invest the training funds available to districts . The teacher 's skill and impact on student achievement are critical , of course , as is their persistence in the field . An initial investment , however costly in the short term , may be increasingly cost effective as a teacher continues to work - and work effectively - in the district . An initial investment of $20,000 , say , may seem costly . However , if the investment yields a capable teacher who works in the district for 10 years , the annual cost of $2,000 seems more reasonable and affordable , particularly in contrast to the cost of repeated recruitment and hiring ( Texas Center for Educational Research , 2000 ) . <p> One problem with relying on graduates of traditional programs is that their supply has never been sufficient to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to be recent graduates of teacher education programs ( Boe , Cook , Bobbitt , &; Terhanian , 2000 ) . Furthermore , younger teachers are more likely to move from job to job , and more likely to leave teaching entirely ( Hanushck , Kain , &; Rivkin , 2004 ) . Alternative routes may be designed to address the particular needs of rural districts , and some elements of design seem more promising for rural districts than others . For example , programs for people who reside in the community seem more likely to succeed than programs that require recruitment of either teachers or trainees from outside the community . Prospective teachers are more likely to remain in schools in communities where they reside ( Dai , Denslow , Dewey , Sindelar &; Rosenberg , 2005 ) . For a number of reasons , paraprofessional step-up programs offer good potential for hard-to staff-schools . However , small rural districts may have few potential trainees ; moreover , because participants typically must complete an undergraduate degree program to be considered highly qualified , paraprofessional step-up programs take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily available to most rural districts , and the small number of potential trainees there makes them undesirable as a target for remote program delivery . ( In fact , paraprofessional step-up programs have worked best in larger districts within easy commuting distance of a campus ( Epanchin &; Wooley-Brown , 1993 ; Sindelar , Daunic , &; Rennells , in press ) . Moreover , step-up programs may be hard to replicate in the short term , particularly if all qualified trainees have been tapped for an initial training cohort . <p> Mid-career changers represent a second potential source of local participants for alternative teacher preparation . Because no degree program would be required and training would be shorter and more focused , this option may offer better potential to rural districts than programs for paraprofessionals . On the other , in a rural district , the available supply of professionals seeking new opportunities may be small ( and the proportion of adults with bachelor 's degrees is smaller in rural areas than is true nationally ( U. S. Census Bureau , n.d . ) ) . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be poorer bets for persisting as teachers than paraprofessionals . For one thing , individuals taking large pay cuts may return to their original careers when opportunities come available , and individuals whose original work had little in common with teaching are at greater risk for attrition than individuals who have experience in closely related fields ( Dai et al . ) . Generally speaking , districts are well advised to learn as much as possible about mid-career changers and to use such information in making decisions about whose training to support . In small towns and rural areas , however , this issue may be less of a problem in that applicants ' potential and motives for changing careers may be widely known . <p> Distance education and web-based courses have been touted as solutions to the program delivery problem ( Ludlow , 1999 ; Rosenkoetter , Irwin , &; Saceda , 2004 ) , but in the special education literature evidence of their efficacy is scarce . Western Governor 's University ( Garlett , Rosenberg , &; Madigan , 2004 ; U. S. Department of Education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses , extensive field work , and on-site supervision . WGU currently offers a program leading to K-8 certification and a mathematics endorsement , and soon will expand into special education . We see great promise in programs delivered remotely to candidates who are invested in both their communities and in teaching as a career . Conclusion <p> The passage of IDEA 2004 and the act 's alignment with NCLB has further solidified the federal role in defining what it means to be a highly qualified special education teacher . As the new IDEA comes on-line , several questions must be addressed . Will " highly qualified " actually translate to " high quality ? " Will the federal requirements to become a highly qualified special educator decrease the critical shortage of special education teachers in rural schools ? Or , will these shortages be exacerbated by driving away potential teacher candidates who do n't see the cost-benefit in meeting the additional subject matter requirements ? Will service delivery in rural areas for students with disabilities in high incidence areas have to be modified with increasing dependence on highly qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special educators serve in consultative roles ? What impact will service delivery modifications have on students ' access to FAPE and their overall academic achievement ? Will the federal emphasis and the rapid growth of alternatives to traditional teacher preparation produce high quality as well as highly qualified special education teachers in rural areas ? Or , will AR programs produce teachers unprepared to deal with the unique needs of students with disabilities in high incidence areas , and thus contribute to the already high attrition rates in rural schools ? <p> As a tandem , NCLB and IDEA 2004 are ushering in a new era in the recruitment , preparation , and retention of special education teachers for rural schools . The stage is set , the actors are in place , and the curtain is going up . We anxiously await the reviews . <p> Michael L.

Detection of serum antigen was inversely related to the number of days between symptom onset and sample collection , and directly related to stool antigen concentration .

This finding is important for the understanding of the pathogenesis , immunology , and clinical manifestations of rotavirus infection . <p> Rotavirus is a common pathogen that is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. 1 Dehydration due to rotavirus-induced diarrhoea and vomiting results in high mortality rates in developing countries and a large economic burden in developed countries. 1 Rotavirus infection is thought to be localised to the gastrointestinal tract . However , there have been reports of rotavirus RNA in cerebral spinal fluid and serum of rotavirus-infected children. 2-7 Rotavirus non-structural proteins have also been reported in liver and kidney sections from rotavirus-infected immunocompromised children , suggesting that extraintestinal spread of rotavirus can occur during infection. 8 Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotavirus infection is not contained within the gastrointestinal tract. 9 , 10 These findings suggest the possibility that rotavirus escapes the intestine into the circulatory system .

Much scepticism has surrounded the RT-PCR detection of rotavirus RNA in cerebral spinal fluid , arising from the concern that these results could result from stool rotavirus contamination during lumbar-puncture sample collection. 2-7 However , many symptoms that would be consistent with the extraintestinal spread of rotavirus have been reported in case studies of rotavirus-infected children during the past 20 years : pneumonia , 17 exanthema , 17 disseminated intravascular coagulation , 18 haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis , 19 and neurological complications such as encephalitis or encephalopathy , 3 , 5 , 19 , 20 cerebellitis , 21 or convulsions or seizures. 2 , 4-6 With no proof of extraintestinal spread , these findings remain only associations , and although they suggest that rotavirus might be related to these symptoms , there is no direct proof that rotavirus infection causes symptoms other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been only a few reports of the detection of rotavirus RNA in blood or other components of the circulatory system in children . Morrison and colleagues 22 used in-situ RT-PCR to analyse the tissues involved in fatal rotavirus infections in two children , and noted viral RNA in the heart and CNS , mainly localised to endothelial cells . Ushijima and colleagues 7 and Nishimura and colleagues 2 found rotavirus RNA using RT-PCR in two of seven serum samples from children with rotavirus diarrhoea. 2 , 7 Our findings ( three of six serum samples from rotavirus-infected children positive for rotavirus RNA ) are consistent with theirs and support the notion that intact rotavirus virions are present in serum during rotavirus infection . However , the design and sensitivity of RT-PCR approaches do not rule out possible stool rotavirus contamination of the serum samples . Because our sample size was small , definitive conclusions about the percentage of samples with rotavirus RNA can not be drawn from these data . However , based on results by Gouvea and colleagues , 14 RT-PCR detection of rotavirus doublestranded RNA has comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitivity of our EIA ( 10 4 particles ) 11 is about one log 10 lower than RT-PCR ( 10 5 particles ) , which accounts for the detection of RNA in only 50% of the antigen-positive serum samples . Other reasons for the inability to detect viral RNA in all samples could be virus breakdown in serum resulting from repeated freezing and thawing ( a difficulty mentioned by the manufacturers of the RNA extraction kit ) , or the presence of PCR inhibitors in serum . <p> Findings of rotavirus antigens in conjunction with rotavirus RNA in serum would have lent more credence to the presence of rotavirus viraemia . Previous reports have not noted rotavirus antigens in serum in conjunction with rotavirus RNA . Saulsbury and colleagues 23 did not detect rotavirus antigen using enzyme-linked fluorescent assay in 14 immunocompetent children admitted to hospital with rotavirus infection . However , three of four rotavirus-infected immunocompromised children did have rotavirus antigen in the blood. 23 Rotavirus proteins have also been detected by immunohistochemical techniques in immunocompromised children with rotavirus infections in extraintestinal sites such as the liver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunocompetent children with fatal rotavirus infections. 8 , 22 The findings of Saulsbury and colleagues contrast with our findings that 22 of 33 immunocompetent children acutely infected with rotavirus infection had detectable rotavirus antigen in serum in the first few days after disease onset . Our results , and the fact that we did not detect rotavirus antigen in convalescent serum , serum from healthy children or adult volunteers , or serum from children with non-rotavirus-associated acute gastroenteritis , show the specificity of the EIA that we used . Differences in sensitivities between Saulsbury and colleagues 1 and our diagnostic approach could , in part , account for the differing results . We have shown that stool antigen concentrations and the number of days between onset of diarrhoea and serum collection affect the ability to detect serum antigen . Thus , the timing of sample collection could have adversely affected Saulsbury and colleagues 1 results . Additionally , rotavirus-specific antibodies or other factors in serum could have hindered detection of rotavirus antigen in serum in both studies . <p> Our work raises the question of how rotavirus escapes the intestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family that contains rotavirus , use transepithelial transport through M cells . These cells are a specialisation of the mucosal epithelium that overlies the Peyer 1s patches , which act as conduits to the immune , lymphatic , and circulatory systems. 24 Rotavirus antigens have been detected in M cells , and these cells could provide rotavirus with access to the bloodstream . <p> Further investigations are needed to establish the importance of our findings in understanding rotavirus pathogenesis , the relation between extraintestinal spread and the severity of disease and tissue damage , the role of viraemia in the immune response , and induction of protective immunity against reinfection . In light of our findings , further studies are needed to reassess the frequency and importance of extraintestinal symptoms associated with rotavirus infection . <p> Contributors : <p> S E Blutt designed and coordinated the study , collected data , and wrote the manuscript .

The increased supply of interactive videodisc programs , coupled with the push to integrate technology within the public school curriculum , compels the educational community to examine the components and effects of interactive videodisc technology . <p> A search of the literature reveals a proliferation of articles dealing with the perceived benefits of interactive videodisc instruction ( IVI ) as well as a number of research-based studies and reviews . Reports of studies which have been conducted exhibit the focus of researchers primarily on the following questions : ( 1 ) Is learner performance improved through the use of videodisc instruction ? ( 2 ) What are learner attitudes toward the use of interactive videodisc instruction ? and ( 3 ) Is reaming time reduced through the use of interactive videodisc instructional systems ? This article examines the three areas , reamer performance , learner attitude and learning time , through a review of empirical studies conducted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Researchers have investigated interactive videodisc instruction comparing it to traditional instruction as well as comparing selected IVI program components : the effects of added simulations , varying degrees of feedback , methodology , and program content . The early studies were conducted as evaluation segments of military projects . <p> As early as 1979 , Holmgren , Dyer Hilligos , and Heller reported on an experimental pilot study of the effectiveness of interactive videodisc on learner performance . This study of 298 military personnel compared the performance results of three groups on Army Training Extension lessons . The control group , receiving traditional instruction , scored significantly higher than the two videodisc groups at the .05 level . However , as is true of many of the early IVI studies , this one has been criticized for the poor quality of the videodisc programs themselves . Additionally , the subjects were not randomly selected nor was a pretest administered ( DeBloois , Maki , &; Hall , 1984 ) . <p> A military training program was again used in an experimental study ( Gibbons et al. , 1982 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control group ( n = 16 ) received traditional classroom instruction . One treatment group ( n = 10 ) used the HAWK Training System lessons on IVI ; the other ( n=20 ) used the same IVI course with an added simulation component . A posttest consisting of one test question revealed that only 25% of the subjects in the control group were able to solve the test question in contrast to 100% of the subjects in the two treatment groups . Moreover , the subjects who received the lessons with the simulation component solved the problem in half the time of the lesson-only group . Based on these results , the researchers concluded that the simulation component has the effect of improving students ' efficiency at problem solving . However , there is some concern that using a posttest containing only one question is not a sufficient indication of IVI 's instructional effectiveness . <p> Students from the U.S. Air Force Academy participated in a study ( Verano , 1987 ) employing the use of a beginning Spanish instructional videodisc , " Zarabanda . " The study focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction on reaming performance . Subjects ( n=92 ) were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and a control group . <p> Each of the three treatment groups received instruction using the interactive videodisc with a varying degree of feedback : ( 1 ) passive viewing of the videodisc ; ( 2 ) viewing with minimal feedback ; and ( 3 ) an interactive viewing mode . The control group viewed a videodisc in English totally unrelated to the material shown the other groups . Scores on posttests for the third interactive instruction group ( with increased feedback ) were significantly higher ( p < .01 ) than all other groups . The researcher concluded that interaction is most likely the factor that accounted for the superior achievement of this group and that the results support the learning theory research on the importance of involving the student in the reaming process . <p> Although the military sector was the first to attempt to measure the effectiveness of IVI , many studies have been conducted by educators in such areas as foreign language , nursing , biology , reading and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams , Quin &; Gale , 1983 ) . These studies involved college and public school students in many disciplines . <p> The use of interactive videodisc instruction in foreign languages was investigated at Brigham Young University by Williams , Quin , and Gale ( 1983 ) . Three groups were established : ( 1 ) a control group which viewed the Spanish videotape " Micario " and received a 50-minute lecture ; ( 2 ) a control group which viewed the " Micario " film as many times as they wanted but received no instruction ; and , ( 3 ) a treatment group which viewed the same material in an interactive form . A 100-item pretest determined that the groups were equivalent ; however , the interactive treatment group outperformed the control groups on the posttest of concepts . The researchers concluded that the use of interactive videodisc was an effective instructional strategy for teaching Spanish . <p> Branch , Ledford , Robertson and Robison ( 1986 ) concluded that the use of interactive was effective when compared to traditional techniques in their study involving 87 first-year veterinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilized random assignment of students and a pretest determining that the two groups did not vary significantly . The control group was exposed to audio heart sound recordings as done traditionally ; however , the experimental group was exposed to a videodisc . A multivariate analysis indicated that there was no significant difference ( p > .05 ) between the treatment and control groups ; both forms of instruction , traditional and interactive , were effective . <p> Lawrence and Price ( 1985 ) used videodisc instruction to teach preservice elementary education students the Language Experience Approach ( LEA ) to teaching reading . This study featured random assignment of students to a control group ( n = 18 ) utilizing traditional instruction and IVI treatment group ( n = 18 ) . The Nelson Denny vocabulary and comprehension test was administered revealing no differences in participants ' reading abilities . A teacher-prepared test of 50 recall questions was also administered as a pre- and posttest . The posttest scores indicated no significant difference ( p , .05 ) could be observed between the two groups . The traditional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEA approach to reading . <p> A number of studies have been conducted employing public school students as subjects and IVI as the instructional strategy . Williams , Quin and Gale ( 1983 ) report on an experimental study involving two classes of high school students using Spanish videodisc instruction . Students were randomly assigned 10 one of three treatments : ( 1 ) an interactive video group in which the students worked individually ; ( 2 ) classroom interactive video in which the students as a group viewed the interactive video ; and ( 3 ) a traditional classroom approach . <p> Students were pretested using the Spanish Modem Language Association ( MLA ) test with no significant group differences found . The posttest consisted of a Spanish listening comprehension exam . Results showed that both of the interactive videodisc groups scored higher on the outcome test than the traditional group ( p < .01 ) . The researchers concluded that interactive videodisc was an effective means of teaching Spanish for this grade level and noted that this medium is also effectively employed as a group teaching strategy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hofmeister , Engelmann , and Carnine ( 1985 ) who utilized the Mastering Fractions program for teaching basic fractions . The study involved 40 students ( 12 fourth-grade students and 28 remedial and special education students ) . The total instructional time was the same for both the control and treatment groups ; the program did differ in the delivery medium ( one group with videodisc and the other with textbook ) . <p> Students were given pre- , post- and maintenance tests on basic fractions skills with a significant difference found between treatments on the post- and maintenance tests . An interesting aspect of this study was that data were also collected on the percent of six-second intervals during which students were on task . The results , averaged across five sessions , were 96 percent on-task for the interactive videodisc group , and 84 percent on-task for the basal group . <p> The interactive videodisc program , Mastering Fractions , was also the focus of a research study in the Nashville public schools ( Hasselbring , 1986 ) . This two-part study examined the effectiveness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of IVI in a variety of settings . <p> Part 1 , examining the program methodology , compared three treatments : ( 1 ) a teacher replication of the Mastering Fractions program using all of the materials but not the videodisc itself ; ( 2 ) the Mastering Fractions videodisc ; and ( 3 ) a traditional teacher presentation using the current fractions curriculum . <p> All students were administered a 69-item pre-post test ; an analysis of covariance showed that the overall gains from pretest to posttest were greater for the Mastering Fractions students and that these students scored higher than did the control group who used the current fractions curriculum . Findings suggested that gains from the use of the Mastering Fractions program can be attributed to instructional content and methodology and not to the novelty effect of the videodisc medium ; further , the Mastering Fractions program was more effective than the existing fractions curriculum . <p> The second part of this evaluation involved examining the effect of the Mastering Fractions videodisc program on student learning in a variety of settings . Participants included 78 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , and 25 eighth grade students . All the students were given the 69-item pretest developed for the experimental study , mastery tests after every five lessons , and the posttest . Teachers were instructed to use the Mastering Fractions program as outlined in the instructor 's manual and to keep a log describing their use in class . While all students made significant gains in the pre-post analysis , the researchers noted that the largest pre-post gains and percent correct on the posttest were found in classes where all of the 15 Mastering Fractions lessons and tests were completed within an eight-week period . In classes where the use of the program was spread over a longer period of time , the pre-post gains and percent correct on the posttest were much lower . The researchers stated that it is the videodisc medium utilizing sound instructional content and methodology which was effective in producing student gains and not the medium itself . <p> The early studies , which have been criticized for the quality of programs and equipment utilized , did not consistently report interactive videodisc instruction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have either shown significant gains for students using IVI or reported that although there is not a significant difference between the instructional modes , interactive videodisc is an effective instructional strategy . Learner performance has been the focus of many empirical studies ; however , when evaluating an instruction medium , reamer attitude toward that medium is also a critical assessment component . Effects on Learner Attitude <p> Many of the studies involving IVI examine the attitudes of learners toward the technology itself and enlist learner evaluation of the medium . Learners ' attitudes toward this medium of instruction are usually quite favorable and perhaps the strongest supporting reason for using interactive videodisc instruction ( Andriessen &; Kroon , 1980 ; DeBloois &; Woolley , 1981 ; Gibbons , et al. , 1982 ) . <p> Feedback from reamers was elicited as a component of an early military study ( Gibbons , et al. , 1982 ) . The most popular features cited by the subjects were the self-pacing , clarity and understandability of the material , the inherent interest in the system , and the realism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio and high degree of reading ; moreover , some of the subjects complained about the quality of the display . However , these dislikes would appear to be more a product of the program itself and not the instructional system . <p> Lawrence and Price ( 1985 ) in their study of the videodisc instruction of the Language Experience Approach to reading reported the favorable attitudes of the students toward the videodisc . Students stated that they enjoyed the feeling of control coupled with the ability to review material at will and return if needed at their own convenience . <p> The Mastering Fractions evaluation studies ( Hasselbring , 1986 ) provided for interviews of participating students and teachers . Teachers reported the positive aspects of the videodisc as a medium which allowed interesting presentation of material , reinforcement , and effectiveness in keeping students on task . <p> When questioned about the negative aspects , teachers felt that students were bored with copying problems from the video screen , the lessons were too long , and the program did not emphasize simplification . When asked how the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the program more at the beginning than at the end of the study . However , the teachers indicated that the students now wanted to know when they could use the disc players again . A typical comment which characterized how the teachers felt was : <p> I loved being able to access a disc . The fractions program was well thought out and used sound teaching concepts . The problem is that we " human-type teachers . like to do things our way and we are all different . l would prefer to integrate the use of the disc in with my regular program and not use it in a canned approach ( p.30 ) . <p> The student interviews included comments about such positive aspects as the benefits of clear program instructions , good illustrations and animation , and ease of understanding . Negative remarks included comments about there being too many reviews and quizzes . When asked which they prefer as a choice to learn fractions , three-fourths said they would use the Mastering Fractions interactive videodisc program and the remaining said they would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a teacher . Again , as in other surveys , the overall responses were quite positive . <p> There are other descriptive studies which focused primarily on learner attitude toward interactive videodisc instruction . One of the earliest was conducted by Andriessen and Kroon ( 1980 ) . Twelve subjects , who spend an average of 55 minutes interacting with a videodisc lesson ( Work of the Heart ) , were observed . The range of time spend on the lessons was 26 minutes to two hours . The subjects were then given a post interview that revealed what they enjoyed about the instructional system : ( I ) the personal control of the materials , ( 2 ) the ability to repeat segments , ( 3 ) jumping through the material , and ( 4 ) easy rewinding . A negative comment by several subjects was that they missed the social interaction provided by other students and/or a teacher . <p> Nursing students ( n = 96 ) in a study conducted by Lynnes ( 1987 ) identified favorable and unfavorable aspects of the IVI medium . Favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90% ) , self-pacing qualities ( 59% ) , and the ability to review and practice ( 57% ) . Unfavorable responses included : the medium was sometimes frustrating ( 38% ) , faults were detected too precisely ( 27% ) , and preference fore live instructor ( 25% ) . <p> An observational study ( Merlin , 1987 ) investigated the use of a prototype interactive videodisc , " Seeing the Unseen , " using a group of 116 middleschool students . Three groups used the videodisc for instruction in whole-class sessions ( n = 86 ) , pairs ( n = 18 ) , and individually ( n = 12 ) . Five instruments were used : observation data sheets , post-use interviews , lesson interviews , student and teacher questionnaires . <p> The students reported that the disc was easy to use , and they welcomed the high level of participation . They emphasized their enjoyment of the TV-like qualities of the medium and the control they had over their reaming . Students found the experience to be beneficial since they could replay segments of the videodisc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupting the teacher 's presentation . The students ( 71% ) stated that videodisc was similar to television but more participatory ; the interactive capability not only encouraged them to pay attention but also helped them learn . When comparing the videodisc to books , 33% of these students mentioned similarities between the two media based on their ability to enjoy a self-paced reaming experience . Additionally , the students preferred working in pairs . <p> Mellin 's study ( 1987 ) also viewed the teacher 's perception of this medium . Teachers indicated that the technology encouraged them to act as guides or facilitators ; however , many had difficulty actually assuming that role . <p> Although teachers and reamers report that there are some negative aspects associated with interactive videodisc instruction , the overwhelming attitude toward the medium is a positive one . Learners miss the personal attention of a teacher and are sometimes frustrated with the technological aspects of the medium ; but , they are enthusiastic about the ability to control reaming at their pace , receive immediate feedback and participate in active reamer involvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lessened when using the interactive videodisc mode . Effects on Learning Time <p> Research studies have utilized the time factor as an IVI evaluation criterion . Lawrence and Price ( 1985 ) noted the time differential in their study of a traditional classroom approach to teaching the Language Experience Method of reading and the videodisc approach . The interactive videodisc group completed the lesson in 40 minutes while the traditional classroom lecture group required a 90-minute lesson . Additionally , the researchers cited the time advantage realized by using the videodisc as a means of reteaching as well as for initial instruction . Significantly less reaming time required for videodisc learner groups compared to traditional classroom instruction was reported by Bunderson ( 1984 ) . It was estimated that there was a 30 to 40 percent time savings with videodisc instruction in comparing the two groups on the variables of presentation time , outside study time , and total reaming time . The author concluded that the time savings involved in using the videodisc instructional strategy should be taken into consideration when evaluating the medium . <p> The Digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Interactive Video Information System ) . A study was undertaken ( May , 1984 ) to determine if the videodisc medium would take less time than a self-paced instruction course and if it would be more motivating than traditional courses . The control group of 48 engineers completed the courses using a self-paced instruction program . The treatment group of 51 engineers received instruction using the IVIS program . The data analysis indicated that the average time students needed to complete the IVIS courses was 23.1 % to 46.5% less . Using t-tests , these differences were significant at the .01 level for two of the courses and at the .05 level . successfully . The time factor involved in instruction is of particular importance to those in the business field but not dealt with as often by the educational community . Conclusion <p> The literature reveals that researchers in the military , business and education sectors have focused on three areas in evaluating the effectiveness of this technological medium : learner achievement , learner attitude , and instruction time . These three measures have provided a blueprint upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that interactive videodisc instruction can be used effectively as an instructional medium for many disciplines and in varied settings . In many cases , researchers indicate that it was more effective than the traditional lecture method . <p> Since learner attitude has been shown to be very positive , this is a further stimulus for the study and use of this technological medium . The reamer controls the teaming time and is able to be actively involved . This appeals to most reamers and was cited by many of the subjects of research studies as the medium 's most favorable feature . This positive reamer attitude toward interactive videodisc is true of all age levels and content areas investigated in this research review . This attitude is further heightened by the appeal of the television screen and computer capabilities of interactive videodisc technology . <p> All of the studies of interactive videodisc instruction involved with examining the time it takes to complete instruction as an effectiveness factor concluded that less time ( to varying degrees ) is involved in learning when compared to more traditional intructional strategies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a teaching strategy . As with any teaching strategy , it should be used with the abilities of the reamer and the content of the program in mind . The self-pacing and interactivity features of the medium make it especially beneficial to reamers . <p> 
@@4012241 Although teaching and research in the arts and sciences are the sine qua non of the modern university in the United States , that tradition has increasingly come under attack. 1 Part of the problem is that many people , including some faculty members , define the teaching and research roles in dichotomous terms . Moreover , many faculty members " often behave as though only one role really matters -- that of research , of creating new knowledge . " 2 This view of teaching and research poses a complex set of problems that broadly affects higher education . Among other things , it calls us to reexamine the message we convey to junior faculty members through the promotion and tenure process ; it impacts the strategies we employ to invigorate unproductive faculty members ; it calls into question how we enhance research productivity without compromising our academic mission ; and it affects the very nature of the curriculum by impacting our perceptions of what we should teach . Our ability to respond to these challenges will not only affect the future vitality of the arts in higher education , it will significantly influence how the arts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the years to come . <p> This article focuses on two of these challenges . My purpose is to call attention to emerging policy issues that arise from a changing climate for research and teaching in higher education . By research , I mean all forms of creative and scholarly inquiry in which new knowledge is created , regardless of whether those intellectual products take form in print , performance , production , or practice . In higher education , we teach to foster intellectual development and expertise through the study of advanced disciplinary knowledge and skills . Teaching includes all activities that support and give structure to learning , including but not limited to what goes on in the classroom , in the studio , on the stage , at the library , in the laboratory , out in the field , in faculty offices , in galleries , and throughout the corridors of our institutions . <p> I will argue that pressures within and outside higher education require arts education policymakers to reconceptualize the relationship between faculty research and teaching .

K-12 arts education must respond to these same pressures . <p> I will also argue that a static or declining resource base for higher education should widen differences among universities , not reduce them . As our disciplines expand , we run the risk of spreading disciplinary knowledge too thin if we do not better capitalize on the institutional context in which teaching and research takes place . We should alter our curricula , selectively building depth to maximize the unique strengths of our respective institutions . I am not alone in recommending that arts programs at large universities should avoid replicating what can best be undertaken at smaller liberal arts colleges , independent schools of art and design , and conservatories for the performing arts that follow European beaux-arts traditions. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ways to maximize its institutional contexts instead of striving to emulate university models for teaching and learning in the arts . Public Perceptions of Research in Higher Education <p> It is important for us to consider why many people are critical of the research role that faculty members are expected to play in higher education . Most agree that the discovery of new knowledge is absolutely crucial in our complicated and vulnerable world. 4 But the general public is concerned that higher education has become so preoccupied with research that faculty members have little time and energy left to teach . Others believe that much of the new knowledge produced by faculty members is too far removed from reality to be of any social value . Practitioners in some disciplines , including K-12 teachers , express concern or even contempt for research in higher education because they construe it as esoteric and/or frivolous . And , as we further specialize to cope with the growing volume of new knowledge in our respective disciplines , the public 's perception that our research is absurdly narrow and arcane intensifies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always attracted by creative research , even from those persons whom we think of as reasonably intelligent . For instance , you may recall the segment on 60 Minutes in which Morley Safer harshly attacked contemporary art .

As recounted in People Weekly : <p> Safer , 62 , his gravelly voice rumbling with contempt , proceeded to savage such high-priced contemporary artists as Cy Twombly ( one of whose $2 million paintings Safer described as " a canvas of scrawls done with the wrong end of a paintbrush " ) , Jeff Koons ( who recently was paid $150,000 for three basketballs submerged in a fish tank -- " giving new meaning to " slam dunk , " said Safer ) and Robert Gobler , whose displayed creations included a row of three porcelain urinals .

It demands our attention , I believe , because it is mostly uninformed . As educators , we are in the business of informing perceptions . Our mission should be to help others understand the value of our research activities . Toward that end , we should assess why even those persons who interact within our immediate sphere -- our students ( many of whom go on to become K-12 teachers ) -- all too often fail to understand our role as researchers . Common Misconceptions about Knowledge Acquisition <p> Faculty research may be largely undervalued because we have not done a good job in helping people understand what our research entails . Traditional teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of new knowledge .

" 6 Schools also perpetuate the misconception that knowledge is what you find in books -- nothing else really counts. 7 Generally speaking , K-12 students rarely ask , nor do their teachers explain , how knowledge is created or in what ways it can take form . <p> In his 1993 presidential address to the American Educational Research Association , Elliot Eisner cited Marcy Singer 's 1991 study of how high school students perceive historical knowledge . Singer found that " students had a difficult time regarding anything other than text as a source of knowledge about the past . They regarded the textbook as sacrosanct " -- the prevalent misconception that if something is written in a book , it must be true. 8 These perceptions were not altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide array of source materials , including the following : <p> Charlie Chaplin 's film , Modern Times ; the film , Rebel without a Cause ; the music of Scott Joplin ; the songs of Pete Seeger ; the music of the Beatles ; the Autobiography of Malcolm X ; Juan Williams 's television program , Eyes on the Prize ; John Steinbeck 's book , Grapes of Wrath ; Ben Shahn 's painting , The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti ; television 's Leave it to Beaver ; the music of Chuck Berry ; paintings by Jackson Pollack . <p> Singer observed that although these historical examples were not thought of as knowledge , their ambiguous nature made for the best classroom discussions . Eisner notes : <p> In restrospect , this is not surprising . After all , what is there to discuss when students confront the certainties of the text ? When it comes to forms of representation that invite interpretation , interpretation followed. 9 <p> As Singer 's study suggests , students who are pursuing higher education , including students in the arts and design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means to interpret and create new knowledge . Although their professors engage in these activities , even advanced students in many fields rarely get a close-up view of faculty research . Very few students have opportunities to see firsthand either how new ideas are cultivated in a discipline or how ideas are crossfertilized through exchanges with other disciplines . Keeping Up with the Expansion of Disciplinary Knowledge <p> One reason why we need to rethink the relationship between teaching and research is because existing curriculum standards do not provide the means to keep pace with the rate at which current knowledge is expanding . Ever since World War II , when universities broadened their focus on teaching to become major research centers , faculty members have played a leading role in the production of new intellectual products . The explosion of new knowledge has been almost unimaginable . Just consider the following statistics : It has been estimated that more new information has been produced in the last thirty years than in the previous 5,000 years. 10 A typical weekday edition of the New York Times contains more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an entire lifetime. 11 In 1989 , it was estimated that 7,000 books were published each day across the globe ; compare that to the mid-fourteenth century when 1,300 volumes made up the entire collection of the largest library in Europe , the Sorbonne Library in Paris. 12 In fiscal year 1992 , 108 major American and Canadian universities reported that their library holdings were over 330 million volumes and 3 million serials , and that they were accumulating additional holdings at the rate of over 9 million volumes per year. 13 <p> The production of new knowledge in the arts is partly reflected in these statistics , but much of what we create does not take form in print . According to the National Endowment for the Arts , no national records are kept on the volume of new works produced each year in the visual and performing arts . Other sources , however , report that production within many U.S. arts and design fields is growing rapidly . For instance , the U.S. film , music , and video industries have been so prolific that some European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly those productions that , by our own standards , have little artistic merit or social value. 14 <p> Also consider that technologies emerging today will give us the ability to create knowledge as never before. 15 It is estimated that the amount of available information now doubles every four or five years , and , by the turn of the century , the doubling time will be every twenty months. 16 This phenomenon has already made a significant impact on creative research . <p> The artist in the last quarter of the century has been faced with a series of problematic choices . Because experiment in the arts has been so wide-ranging and because modern technology makes so much experience immediately available as a subject or example , the artist 's range of options has never been greater . At the same time such range can be seen as fragmenting and arbitrary , dictated not by the pressures of coherent society so much as by a plethora of information. 17 <p> Consequently , some faculty members are doing their very best to restrict the flow of new information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all . That resistance is not altogether unwarranted because , as humorist Dave Barry observes , much of that information and those ideas are not worth having access to . Looking back to the future , Barry quips in a recent Newsweek article that : <p> By the mid-90 's , just about everybody was hooked up to the vast international computer network , exchanging vast quantities of information at high speeds via modems and fiber-optic cable with everyone else . The problem , of course , was that even though the information was coming a lot faster , the vast majority of it , having originated with human beings , was still wrong . Eventually people realized that the Information Highway was essentially CB radio , but with more typing. 18 <p> In all seriousness , we face an enormous challenge in deciding how to help students grasp the big picture of our disciplines while leading them to develop in-depth knowledge in an area of specialization that will serve them well beyond graduation . Making choices about the depth and breadth of a curriculum is an age-old problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from . Never before has the big picture been so big . As arts education policymakers , we will need to pay more attention to this problem and look for ways to adapt or reinvent the infrastructure upon which our existing curriculum rests . It is equally important that universities build curricular infrastructures that will undergird curricular reform in K-12 arts education . The Disciplinary Structure of Teaching and Research in Higher Education <p> Historically , higher education has given structure to knowledge dissemination by organizing the curriculum around academic disciplines . The disciplinary curricular structure of U.S. universities took hold between 1870 and 1900 , when <p> the number of college faculty grew nearly fivefold , from 5,553 to 23,863 . The number increased not primarily to keep pace with student enrollment ( 113,131graduates in 1870 ; 226,530 in 1900 ) , but to accommodate the growth in academic research and outreach services. 19 <p> The production of new disciplinary knowledge is now integral to the curricular infrastructure of modern universities . The actual process of creating new knowledge , however , has been principally reserved for faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terminal master 's degree programs , students are typically seen as the receivers of new knowledge , not as creators . Students may engage in exercises and experiments to rediscover existing disciplinary knowledge or to practice problem solving and decision making in the discipline , but these learning activities are typically not regarded as research that yields new knowledge . <p> Generally speaking , higher education does not enable its students to understand how knowledge is actually created . This is even often true in teacher education programs . Consider students ' typical introduction to disciplinary knowledge through survey courses . Despite the best of intentions , many survey courses merely provide <p> a groundwork of facts and principles , leaving out connections to the people who have advanced the field and delaying the introduction of the wonder of discovery to the more advanced levels of instruction. 20 <p> As the body of knowledge in a discipline grows , survey courses become increasingly less useful . We should question whether this historical curriculum model will soon become obsolete . Are we asking the faculty members who teach survey courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty members identify disciplinary knowledge that should be omitted from the curriculum ? Providing answers to the latter question is especially relevant for those who seek to build more substantial bridges between universities and K-12 schools . The Nature of Advanced Learning <p> We also need to reexamine our expectations about student learning . While some educators believe students can be best served by knowing a little about a lot of things as long as they also possess critical thinking skills , research on learning does not support this argument . What seems certain is that the acquisition of expertise is discipline specific. 21 For example , an expert in nuclear physics will function as a relative novice in solving problems in political science or in understanding the historical significance of contributions by Martha Graham to dance , Mies van der Rohe to architecture , Arnold Schoenberg to music , Arthur Miller to theatre , and Georgia O'Keeffe to the visual arts . <p> Research on novice/expert differences also shows that experts use effective knowledge-seeking strategies and advanced thinking skills because they have acquired a sizable body of in-depth disciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " learning how to learn . " 23 <p> One continually encounters the pronouncement that students ' heads should not be filled with information but that instead students should be taught how to find the information they need . This is one of the silliest of persisting ideas in education . A related but more plausible educational belief is that students should not be taught isolated facts ; rather , they should be taught central concepts that render facts meaningful . Research . . . has shown , however , that the ability to grasp and retain new information , to link it meaningfully to central ideas , depends greatly on the extent of one 's existing knowledge . People with little knowledge in a domain are almost compelled to deal with knowledge as isolated fragments , only vaguely relatable to higher level principles. 24 <p> The problem we must address is that novices in any field tend to develop " shallow " knowledge structures . They acquire " a few general ideas and a lot of details connected to the general ideas but not to each other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , or a specialized vocabulary without understanding the conditions of how and where that knowledge applies and can be used most effectively . " 26 <p> As experts , faculty members possess " deep or multilevel knowledge structures , with many connections between and within levels . " 27 This equips them to use their knowledge in various contexts , while novices often find it difficult to transfer their existing knowledge at appropriate times . When a student 's prior knowledge becomes inert , it is rendered essentially useless . Didactic teaching methods , compartmentalized curricula , and rote-learning strategies encourage the acquisition of inert knowledge , which , in turn , stifles the development of learning in a discipline . <p> The educational implications of these findings are worth policy-makers ' serious consideration . It is increasingly evident that we should work towards setting curriculum standards to disseminate knowledge that students will be able to use later -- not in the restrictive sense of vocational application alone , but for the broader purpose of enhancing thinking and expertise . This means disseminating as much knowledge to students as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise find meaningful . <p> As the body of disciplinary knowledge expands , we will face even harder choices in selecting what to teach , let alone how to ensure that content is meaningfully disseminated to students . If the solution to this problem is to narrow the curriculum by creating more subdisciplines and areas of specializations , we must be aware that organizing curricula in this way can reduce our students ' ability to grasp important connections within and beyond arts disciplines . One way to help students see past discipline boundaries is to align curriculum standards and teaching practices to correspond more closely with the ways research inquiry is pursued in our disciplines . The Influence of Other Disciplines on Research in the Arts and Design <p> It is not uncommon for artists and scholars to draw upon ideas from other disciplines in their personal research . The attraction of interdisciplinary collaboration is that we can continue to pursue depth within an area of specialization , yet draw upon expertise in related disciplines when the need arises . This allows us to gain valuable input from other fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own discipline . <p> Some researchers in the arts search for innovation by working back and forth between two or more disciplines . Crossdisciplinary research has a strong history in the arts -- some of the best known examples date back to the Italian Renaissance and earlier . For instance , Michelangelo 's work crossed painting , sculpture , and architecture , and Leonardo da Vinci worked simultaneously as a painter , astronomer , architect , and engineer , among other things . <p> Contemporary researchers in the arts have had more difficulty in working between disciplines . For example , on my own campus , Charles Csuri confronted many obstacles when he sought to explore computer applications for art making during the 1960s . Although computer scientists supported Csuri 's interdisciplinary exploration of ideas , the same was not true of faculty in his home department . The vision of artists , designers , and scientists working within the same environment has now been realized on our campus under the umbrella of the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design ( ACCAD ) . Reaching that goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Today , ACCAD is among the most successful computer visualization and animation programs in the nation , and it has a prominent international standing . Graduate students who study at ACCAD work with faculty and staff to produce creative works that simply could not be undertaken without close association with the computer science community on our campus . Furthermore , students benefit because under its current director , Wayne Carlson , ACCAD attracts professional staff from the Ohio Supercomputer Center as well as researchers and students from many fields , including : <p> aeronautical engineering , architecture , studio art , art education , art history , city and regional planning , cognitive science , computer and information science , dance , design , industrial systems engineering , geodetic sciences , instructional design and technology , medicine , music , speech and hearing , and theatre . <p> Other contemporary researchers have also been discouraged from engaging in more than one arts or design discipline . A case was cited recently by Maya Lin in an interview about the installation of a new sculptural work she created for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When asked to explain why , as the well-known architect of the Vietnam War Memorial , she also made sculpture , Maya Lin replied : <p> Ten years ago , people who were trying to do more than one thing were met with a lot of suspicion , but that 's changed . Somehow it seems very human to do several things that have to do with one another . I love architecture and I love sculpture , and I could never choose . Sculpture to me is poetry ; and architecture , is like creating a novel. 28 <p> These examples suggest that we need to provide more support for the exploration of ideas beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries . In the past , we have resisted supporting this exploration , sometimes inadvertently and sometimes quite deliberately . That resistance is gradually lessening as many programs in the arts at universities strive to become increasingly interdisciplinary . The same progression towards interdisciplinary inquiry can be found in some K-12 arts programs , but overall that progress has been constrained by the dominant disciplinary structure in which arts teachers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arts and Design Curricula <p> If our goal is that students should meaningfully connect information within and between disciplines , we need to question the tradition of organizing curricula in any way that inhibits interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary inquiry . Academic departments in colleges and universities and independent institutions of higher education are structured to preserve and perpetuate the disciplines they represent . That effort is desirable because advanced learning and expertise is specialized in nature and because " disciplines do continually turn up better ways of construing reality -- better not because they correspond more closely to reality , but because they enlarge our field of vision , equipping us with tools for doing things " that were previously beyond our imagination. 29 <p> At the same time , rigid allegiance to a discipline or subdiscipline can inhibit the creation and understanding of important knowledge . When students see themselves as members of a narrow area of specialization , we can not be sure that they are prepared to take full advantage of new ideas and relevant knowledge in other fields . <p> The only intelligent way to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crossdisciplinary collaboration . This is not easy when we are simultaneously pressured to respond to the growing volume of disciplinary knowledge in our own fields . The problem is , however , not insurmountable when we consider that university faculty members are proficient at exploring . ideas through their own research , often in directions that move beyond disciplinary boundaries or have the potential to do so . <p> If our goal is to prepare the next generation of innovators in our respective disciplines and future teachers who will lead others to understand those innovations , we will need to develop new strategies and technologies for helping our students organize , evaluate , and cross link knowledge of the past to emerging ideas of the present. 30 That might be best accomplished if we took full advantage of the fact that as faculty members in institutions of higher education , we are the ones who help advance disciplinary knowledge . As researchers , we can and should lead our students to discover how and why new ideas emerge in the field by engaging in research that is closely linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research-based or inquiry-based models of teaching is that they can place as much emphasis on researching what is already known in the discipline as they do on discovering what is yet unknown . As experienced researchers , college or university faculty members can function as the source of current knowledge in the discipline and as leaders in directing the search for new ideas . Instead of viewing the curriculum as a " fixed agenda , " we might think of it as a matrix or map or network of big ideas . <p> Working from such a matrix or map provides us with an overall sense as opposed to a linear sense of direction , where one topic follows another . The teacher 's task , given the matrix or network view of curriculum , extends beyond that of a manager or orchestrator who ensures that things unfold as planned . Rather than remain above the fray , teachers work alongside students , serving as a kind of " cross-country guide " as they explore the territory mapped out by the network of big ideas. 31 <p> Approaching teaching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it would require structuring the curriculum somewhat differently. 32 Learning Through Collaborative Research <p> To some faculty members in the arts and design , the thought of merging teaching with research may seem overly restrictive -- perhaps limiting the personal exploration and expression of ideas that are so important to creative disciplines . However , as artists and scholars who teach , we should welcome the opportunity to distinguish our work from that produced by independent artists and scholars who can not as readily capitalize on what students can bring to the creation of new knowledge . <p> There are countless examples of students in the arts who have played important roles in contributing to creative and scholarly thinking . This is particularly true in performance disciplines , such as contemporary dance , because performance is almost always a collaborative activity . My colleague , Vickie Blaine , who chairs the Department of Dance at Ohio State University , tells me that her work in solving compositional problems has been greatly influenced by students over the years . Blaine looks at her students as individuals with unique perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nurturing . She fosters an atmosphere of learning in which her students draw ideas from one another , and she expects to learn from her students in the process of teaching . The end result is that a choreographer like Bebe Miller , one of Blaine 's many successful former students , now often uses a collaborative framework for creating new works with the dancers in her own professional company . <p> Another example of collaborative inquiry between professor and student can be found in the history of music education . In the preface to his seminal book , Harmonielehre ( 1911 ) , composer Arnold Schoenberg describes how he worked to blur the line between teaching and research : <p> This book I have learned from my pupils . In my teaching I never sought merely " to tell the pupil what I know . " Better to tell him what he did not know . . . . The teacher must have the courage to admit his own mistakes . He does not have to pose as infallible , as one who knows all and never errs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps sometimes finding . . . . Successful completion of assignments by the pupils established the soundness of my efforts without luring me into the fallacy that I had solved the problem definitively . And I think neither the pupils nor I have fared badly that way . Had I told them merely what I know , then they would have known just that and nothing more . As it is , they know perhaps even less . But they do know what matters : the search itself ! 33 <p> Many other faculty members in the arts commonly use highly interactive and individualized teaching practices . More than most other higher education fields , the arts and design have a tradition of blurring the line between teaching and research . Much of our teaching directly engages students in the act of interpretation , problem solving , decision making , and other active learning experiences . <p> But we are not without our faults . We also lapse into didactic teaching methods on occasion . And sometimes we are so process oriented that we neglect to teach our students much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and for creating new works . Thus , one of our challenges as policymakers is to explore how to better integrate the disciplinary knowledge of the past into curriculum standards that are trying to anticipate the future . That future is likely to place growing importance on the institutional context in which our teaching and research takes place . Acknowledging Different Contexts for Disciplinary Inquiry <p> Clearly , higher education does not currently have the resources to support the full scope of inquiry possible in arts and design disciplines . The forecast for future support is not encouraging . Even the largest comprehensive research universities are discovering that they can not do everything . In the years ahead , all institutions of higher education will have to find greater focus to cope with increasingly expansive disciplines . This poses an even more serious problem for K-12 education . <p> If new knowledge continues to grow as projected , we will need to escalate our search for ways to make the best possible use of limited human and capital resources . It makes most sense to do so by planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique about the context in which that teaching and research occurs -- the particular college or university setting as well as the broader community in which that institution exists . Most institutions already do this to some extent , but we will need to intensify our efforts . This includes challenging the very idea of " the core curriculum . " <p> At present , " the core " is that part of our curriculum that replicates what is taught at other institutions offering the same degree program . That is the very nature of accreditation standards . Some policymakers in higher education argue that a standardized model of core-degree requirements is the best way to preserve and perpetuate disciplinary knowledge . Many other faculty members argue that it is increasingly difficult to find a disciplinary core , while future K-12 teachers leave our teacher education programs thinking that " the core " is absolute -- what is fundamental to understanding an arts discipline is not subject to change . <p> The further expansion of disciplinary knowledge will tempt some educators to enlarge the core curriculum . A negative consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn what can be uniquely gained from the institution they are attending . It might be wiser to replace the idea of a core that replicates other degree programs with a core that gives focus to specializations that reflect the unique strengths of a particular department , college , university , and professional community . Rather than working to create and disseminate knowledge within self-contained programs , we might build articulated networks of complementary programs across many institutions . Such articulation could ensure that disciplinary knowledge is covered in depth and breadth by a network of institutions -- not by each accredited institution in and of itself . New technologies give us the means to make this possible if we want it to happen . <p> I am suggesting that programs offered at large universities should look very different from those offered at small liberal arts colleges , conservatories for the performing arts , and independent schools of art and design . For instance , arts curricula at universities might give particular emphasis to new technologies and to interdisciplinary study , playing up the rich opportunities that exist at universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universities , because they are so diverse in the disciplines they teach and support , provide atypical forums for artistic growth . . . . They provide through their great diversity an unusual opportunity for interdisciplinary study , not only among artists , but between artists and scholars in what may have been mutually exclusive areas of study -- certainly disciplines that would never have been taught in conservatories or schools of beaux-arts. 34 <p> Schools of art and design and conservatories also have resources that are uniquely their own . For instance , many independent schools of art and design are advantaged by the fact that they are colocated with major museum collections , and/or they are closely affiliated with professional arts and design organizations . <p> Similar pressures on " the core curriculum " within K-12 education have led some schools to reduce or eliminate arts education programs . Those in higher education must not forget that their definition of " the core " often sets de facto standards for elementary and secondary schools . Therefore , if universities move toward building curricula around focused disciplinary and interdisciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to help K-12 educators build compatible , though not identical , curricular structures . It seems certain that the current quest for comprehensiveness in all facets of K-12 and higher education curricula will become increasingly less feasible as disciplinary knowledge expands in all fields , including the arts . Conclusion <p> The production of new knowledge is valuable because it broadens our vision , enhances our own understanding , and nurtures innovation , " yet the sheer volume of the data amassed makes almost inevitable the reduction of our focus to what is in the end a very narrow endeavor. " 35 Arts policymakers in higher education must take account of this problem . We must <p> address much more seriously the consequences of the explosion of knowledge , its specialization and fragmentation . It is not enough just to be a contributor to the expansion of knowledge . Unorganized , unrelated , and uninterpreted knowledge becomes inaccessible . It loses its potential and erodes commitment to the value of knowledge. 36 <p> As arts disciplines expand , it becomes increasingly important that we prepare our students to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining questions generated by themselves and others , and to understand how those questions relate to existing disciplinary knowledge . We must take steps to revisit current educational practices . To start , we should acknowledge that " schooling , with its continual emphasis on the answering of questions as the immediate goal of learning , may be defeating the development of expertise in all but the most hardy students . " 37 Policymakers should find ways to support the acquisition of knowledge and skills through interactive , research-based inquiry . We need to remind ourselves that elementary and secondary teachers will not approach teaching the arts as disciplinary and interdisciplinary inquiry if they , themselves , do not fully understand the arts as forms of thinking and knowing . Likewise , we can not expect K-12 arts teachers to teach through research-based inquiry if those opportunities were absent from their own learning experiences . By learning how their professors draw upon expertise in related fields , our students can build a strong foundation for extending and applying disciplinary knowledge long after graduation . <p> Reaching that goal will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of learning . The very idea that the acquisition of knowledge is an interpretive act is foreign to many students , including those pursuing university degrees . John McPherson vividly captures this problem in one of his cartoon series , Close to Home . He pictures a student , named Wayne Merlman , who is hard at work studying a book on the history of the Magna Carta . The cartoon caption states , " Unable to find a Hi-Liter , Wayne Merlman used a black Magic Marker to cross out all the stuff he did n't want to read again . " We see from the cartoon illustration that the only thing Wayne thinks worth remembering is that " The Magna Carta was signed in 1215. " 38 Unfortunately , many students in higher education , like Wayne , think that learning requires rote memorization of factual information or the mindless acquisition of technical skills . Some of these students are studying the arts , and a subset of these students will one day become elementary and secondary arts teachers . <p> We should look at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves to traditional routes . <p> The amazing developments in information technology offer quite wonderful avenues for our inventiveness . Perhaps their most important contribution is their reframing of the dimensions of possibility. 39 <p> For instance , when it is impractical for students to engage in research-based inquiry with faculty because of the lack of space , equipment , materials , and time , we now have the means to use or invent new interactive technologies to simulate a research learning environment -- one that comes close to erasing the line between research and teaching . <p> The curricular divisions , core degree requirements , and institutional independence , which have served us so well historically , will need to be revisited to face the demands of teaching increasingly vast bodies of disciplinary knowledge . With greater production of knowledge in the future comes a greater responsibility for us to teach the significance of that knowledge , or the lack thereof . It seems inevitable that we should look to other institutions to share that responsibility , rather than attempting to go it alone . <p> <p>

PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> 
@@4008141 The Israel-Palestine Liberation Organization Declaration of Principles has created enthusiasm about the prospects for economic cooperation between Arabs and Israelis . Arab-Israeli economic cooperation is exciting because of its political benefits , not to mention its economic effects . Thus , proposals for economic cooperation should be judged primarily by their promotion of peace , rather than simply by their direct economic effect . In particular , economic cooperation can ease the Israeli sense of regional isolation and promote its acceptance by its neighbors . Furthermore , as each side reaps measurable economic benefits , future agreements may be more feasible in less politically sensitive areas than Palestinian sovereignty . <p> The strategy of achieving peace through incremental cooperation in areas of mutual advantage , such as trade , is problematic . The strategy itself has long been controversial among Arabs and continues to be rejected by many Arab radicals . For many years , the majority in the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) preferred to hold off on any form of cooperation , no matter how profitable , as a means to increase the pressure for a comprehensive political settlement . Today , Arab radicals complain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign to dominate the region . As Aqba Ali Saleh wrote in the leading Saudi daily Asharq al-Awsat , " The merging of technologically backward economies with a high-tech economy necessarily entails domination by the latter and restriction of the former 's scope for development . " 1 <p> Despite objections from such radicals , most in the region view economic cooperation as a step towards peace . Unfortunately , some also have the unrealistic expectation that Arab-Israeli economic cooperation is the key to a nation 's prosperity . No one is more optimistic than Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , a longtime advocate of economic cooperation . As he argued , " There are only two alternatives for the Levant : Benelux or Yugoslavia . " That is , prosperity and peace through cooperation or poverty and war. 2 In his latest book , written with Arye Naor , Peres outlines his vision of a Middle East common market. 3 Crown Prince Hasan of Jordan shares Peres ' vision . At an important recent conference on the economic implications of Middle East peace , Hasan spoke of the long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement similar to that which exists between Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg . " As Hasan has noted : <p> A free-trade zone across the Middle East would be the ultimate goal . Arrangements for a Middle East Free Trade Agreement -- a MEFTA along the lines of NAFTA North American Free Trade Agree-merit -- would allow the region to play a more creative role in the world economy ... Such a development would provide an impetus for a new relationship of hope in the Middle East. 4 <p> Peres ' and Hasan 's vision of the Middle East developing along lines similar to NAFTA is not realistic . The Middle East is just not in the same economic league as either NAFTA or the European Union ( E.U. ) . The 1991 gross domestic product ( GDP ) Of Israel and the Arab states was less than $500 billion , as compared to over $6,000 billion for NAFTA and the E.U. Table 1 . The merchandise trade of Israel and the Arab states in 1992 was less than $300 billion , as compared to four times that amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The total GDP of the Arab League members is less than the GDP of Belgium and the Netherlands . Even if Israel were to develop as close relations with the Arab states as it now has with those two , the market opportunities would still be limited when compared to the greater possibilities in the larger E.U. market- the natural market for Israeli , Jordanian , and Palestinian producers . While there are some excellent opportunities for profit from Arab-Israeli economic cooperation , the regional markets are just too small for such an endeavor to have much of a macroeconomic effect on the region . <p> Furthermore , the Middle East is a region in which states have not yet developed dose economic relations with each other . Examples abound of political restrictions on economic ties between Arab states : Jordan has been effectively shut out of the Saudi market in retaliation for King Hussein 's stand on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait ; Libya and Egypt each has slammed shut its common border in response to one or another episode ; and Syria cut off the flow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the most part , Arab states do not trade very much with each other . In 1992 , for instance , Jordan had $54 million in trade flows with its neighbor Syria and $64 million with Egypt -- 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent of its total trade , respectively. 5 <p> Even if governments were not to interfere with economic ties , consumer resistance based on traditional enmities could still jeopardize Israeli-Arab economic cooperation . Such resistance could continue for decades after a comprehensive peace treaty . Look at Greece and Turkey for example . They have been at peace for 70 years ; their troops serve under common North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) command . The two neighbors have economies that should be complementary , as Turkish textiles could be traded for Greek industrial goods . Yet their trade flow in 1992 was a paltry $250 million , less than 0.7 percent of either country 's total trade flows . <p> Economic cooperation is not the central economic issue for Israel , Jordan , the West Bank and Gaza ; rather , job creation is everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same fundamental problem : double-digit rates of unemployment combined with an exploding labor force looking for work locally . In Jordan , this explosion is due to returnees from Kuwait ; in the West Bank and Gaza , to the fewer opportunities for employment in Israel ; and in Israel , to immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia . The real impetus for job creation is going to come from economic reform : easing government regulations , building new infrastructure , providing ready access to bank credit and enacting policies to promote exports to the larger European markets . In summary , the needed economic reforms themselves have little to do with cooperation ; they depend much more on internal reforms in each area . COOPERATION ON TRADE <p> Trade cooperation is blocked by the illiberal trading regimes common in the region . The Egyptian , Syrian and Israeli governments each have long traditions of paternalistic etatisme , rooted respectively in Nasserism , Ba'athism and Labor Zionism . Breaking free from the outdated statist models of the past would do more than any other step to make economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to grow as long as the state protects local firms against foreign competition . <p> As an example of how artificial barriers can restrict trade , consider the small volume of Egyptian-Israeli trade : $13.3 million in 1992 , amounting to 0.04 percent of Israel 's trade and 0.07 percent of Egypt's. 6 Much could be done to simplify trade procedures . Israelis justifiably protest the administrative barriers to exporting to Egypt , but Egyptians could also complain about the low share of Gaza 's imports that come through Egypt or the impossibility of marketing cheap Egyptian agricultural produce in Israel . <p> The Arab-Israeli trade that does occur usually violates the rules of at least one of the governments . For example , Israeli rules have until recently firmly forbidden the import of Palestinian eggs except in a few special circumstances , yet West Bank producers provide about 120 million eggs a year for the 1.8 billion-egg Israeli market . The practical effect of the Israeli rules is to increase the income of Israeli middlemen who find ways to smuggle the eggs , while reducing the income of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could for their produce . Every attempt to crack down on the smuggling ends up increasing the margins demanded by the smugglers , reducing the income of the Palestinian producers and raising the prices paid by Israeli consumers . <p> Israel is not the worst offender with regard to trade-inhibiting rules -- quite the contrary . The Arab League maintains several layers of boycott against Israel , observed by all its members except Egypt . The primary or direct boycott on Israeli products is enforced well enough that Israeli exports have to use subterfuge to find their way into Arab markets , reducing the trade volume to a trickle . The direct boycott boasts strong political support and is unlikely to end soon , except in Jordan . On the other hand , the secondary boycott on companies doing business with Israel , and the tertiary boycott , on companies doing business with companies on the boycott blacklist , are increasingly less enforced. 7 <p> The paradox of the boycott is that its primary victims are Palestinian businessmen who can not ship their goods to Arab markets because they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boycott of these Palestinian products could significantly increase Palestinian sales in the Arab world . On the other hand , dropping the boycott on Israeli-made products would not necessarily create great market opportunities for Israeli businessmen , since the regional market is small ( Israel 's Arab neighbors have a GDP less than Israel 's ) and Arab consumers may resist Israeli products even if there are no official barriers . <p> The official barriers to trade are being reduced in most of the Middle East . Many governments have announced plans to ease back the heavy hand of regulation and liberalize the economy . In recent years , Israel and Jordan in particular have issued bold statements about their commitment to structural reforms to open up their economies . Not surprisingly , each has proceeded at a slow pace , because they face challenges from domestic groups that benefit from existing regulations . Nevertheless , the small changes have begun to add up to a substantial difference . Over the last few years , Israel has eliminated nearly all quantitative restrictions on non-agricultural trade with the West Bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural goods . As a result , Palestinian textiles , shoes and agricultural implements , among other products , have taken a large share of the Israeli market . <p> The area in the Middle East with by far the freest trade is the West Bank and Gaza . The reason is not admiration for the teachings of David Ricardo , but the lack of a government to create and enforce restrictions . The Israeli occupation authorities made the West Bank and Gaza into an importers ' dream : no duties and essentially no restrictions . Until 1991 , Palestinian exports faced many barriers as part of the Israeli policy of discouraging Palestinian industry and agriculture , fostering Palestinian dependence on Israeli production . Those barriers to export have been largely eliminated since 1991 as part of Israel 's reversal of policy to now encourage Palestinian output in order to reduce unemployment-induced unrest. 8 Ricardo would be proud of the West Bank and Gaza : They practice free trade even though they face extensive protectionism from their neighbors . Israel and Jordan use a wide array of trade restrictions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quality standards but are in fact transparent protectionist devices ( for example , insisting that each pencil made in the territories bear a label in Hebrew ) . <p> Since signing the Accord with the PLO , the Israelis have committed themselves to phasing in complete free trade with the Palestinians over five years . However , the remaining formal trade restrictions , which are on agricultural goods , will be phased out slowly to reduce the resistance from the beneficiaries of current restrictions ( who may also be given transitional assistance , such as the buyout of chicken and egg farmers included in the 1994 Israeli budget ) . 9 The initial quotas for Palestinian products , agreed to in bilateral negotiations in Paris , are equal to the estimated existing illegal trade. 10 As important as the removal of formal trade barriers will be Israeli willingness to relax the disguised barriers , such as quality and labeling standards . The prospects for reducing disguised barriers are mixed , because of exaggerated Israeli fears about competition from West Bank and Gaza producers , who are too small to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are succeeding primarily in industries ( such as simple textiles ) that are already in decline due to competition from low-cost foreign producers. 11 <p> Because of these exaggerated worries about competition , Israeli liberalization of imports from the West Bank and Gaza is scheduled to be slow . Correspondingly , Palestinians are unlikely to perceive any dramatic change in their standard of living as a result of increased trade opportunities ; they will instead see a slow , steady improvement . That is unfortunate , as a rapid increase in Palestinian incomes might have more of an effect on Palestinian public opinion . Any estimate of the effects of liberalization on the Palestinian economy must be speculative , given the poor data on Palestinian production and exports . But the situation inspires optimism : The Palestinians know the nearby Israeli market , a $63 billion economy which is 25 times the size of their own and is growing at a solid clip of 4 to 5 percent per annum . Many Palestinian businesses already compete well without any government protection or benefits . Palestinian producers have a substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given ready access to the markets . My guess , and it is only that , is that a complete and immediate lifting of barriers to Palestinian trade could result in double-digit growth within a year , fueled by export growth on the order of $100 million to $150 million . <p> Between Israel , the Palestinian territories and Jordan , the prospects for open borders and cooperation look good in the medium term , though the pace of the opening may be slow . The last several Israeli governments have been committed to opening up markets ; the principle itself is not controversial in that often fractious country . The Jordanian government wants access to the Israeli-Palestinian customs union . The two sides are disputing the pace and method of liberalization , with Jordan wanting an initial quota of $300 million a year ( up from a current $15 million ) and rising thereafter , and Israel preferring a smaller quota and proportionate access to Jordan 's market . The dispute sounds like that between many trading partners about how to liberalize trade , in which the issue at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few years ago m the Palestinian community , any proposal for economic cooperation with Israel was controversial . Now , the PLO and business communities recognize that the West Bank and Gaza will benefit from close links to the Israeli economy . In the Paris bilateral discussions , all agreed that there are to be no new barriers to the movement of goods ( no customs checkpoints or border posts ) between the Palestinian territories and Israel . The two sides are negotiating the fine points of the future customs union . The Israelis have agreed already to let the Palestinian side set the tariff rate on items of special interest to Palestinians ( for example , the traditional Palestinian type of vegetable oil ) in return for Israel retaining the right to set the tariff rate on all the other items . The Palestinians have accepted the continuing use of Israeli facilities , such as electricity generating plants and water systems , for part of their needs rather than having the unrealistic goal of creating a completely separate infrastructure . To be sure , the Palestinians want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital goods and outlets for their agricultural and industrial products so that they are not completely dependent on Israeli suppliers and purchasers , but that reflects good business sense rather than a desire for Palestinian show projects ( like an electric generating plant , which would have to be small , and therefore , uneconomical , if it were to serve only the Palestinian market ) . COOPERATION ON CAPITAL FLOWS <p> Capital flows to Israel and the Arab world come in two main categories : commercial investment and aid . Each can contribute to peace through its political impact , but the economic impact is not likely to be large beyond Palestinian territories . <p> Commercial investment offers limited short-term potential for cooperation despite many ideas for publicity-generating Israeli-Arab joint investments . The most prominent project being considered actively at the moment is a multibillion dollar project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to Israel . Discussions are progressing on the project despite Qatari skittishness about publicity. 12 Other examples include a canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea , diversion of water from the Nile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damascus to Tel Aviv . Such projects will not cement the recent peace accord . They are almost sure to be accompanied by dispute-provoking cost overruns , which will strain relations between the partners . Besides , they take years to reach maturity , at which point opinions about the peace accord will have solidified ; therefore , the projects themselves will not have much impact on how the peace accord is viewed . In addition , several proposed projects would have low economic rates of return . <p> Then there are the demonstration projects , typically to transfer Israeli technology to Arab nations . These projects may promote good will , as did the Israeli-supported agricultural research program in Nubariya , Egypt. 13 However , such transfers are often simply ignored by the recipient , for whom the project is typically arranged by the Israeli government , which is eager to demonstrate the advantages of Israeli technology . <p> More promising are joint investments by private businessmen from Israel and Arab countries , especially those aimed at conducting business with a third country ( that is , a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example would be a hypothetical joint Israeli-Moroccan investment in Egyptian agro-industry producing for the European market . These joint ventures bring together investors who have specific strengths to contribute , and who are less dependent on the good will of the host government since their markets lie elsewhere . These projects are the most likely to have a good economic rate of return , which also makes them the best candidates for long-term survival . Several such schemes have been already announced , with the Arab partners backpedaling in the face of adverse public reactions at home . <p> Similarly , various efforts are underway currently to promote joint investments with Jewish and ethnic Arab businessmen , inincluding nationals of the United States and other industrial nations . For instance , former Congressman Melvin Levine of California and Arab-American activist James Zogby lead an investment-promotion group , the formation of which was encouraged by the U.S. Government . <p> In short , commercial investments can be a means to bring together Arab and Israeli businessmen , but the inevitable snags and delays in any new field -- always magnified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be limited , at least in the near-term . <p> Commerical investment , important as it may be in the future , has not been the main type of international capital flow in the Levant . Aid has been far more important . The Levant states receive truly astonishing amounts of economic aid , in addition to generous military assistance . In 1991 official development assistance from OECD and Arab countries to Israel was $354 per person ; to Jordan , $247 ; to Egypt , $93 ; to Syria , $30. 14 The principal sources were the U.S. for Israel and Egypt , European states for Jordan , and Arab states for Syria . By comparison , the average for low income economies that year was $10 and for middle-income countries , $16 . <p> Despite the heavy demands on aid budgets worldwide , in October 1993 the donor community pledged $2 billion in aid for the West Bank and Gaza and in December 1993 it pledged that 1994 commitments alone would reach $570 million. 15 If these funds were disbursed on a timely basis , the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all sources ( including tens of millions of dollars from non-governmental organizations ) . 16 However , the prospects for timely disbursement are at best mixed . The usual bilateral and multilateral institutions , such as the World Bank , are proceeding in the West Bank and Gaza on what is for them an accelerated basis . But that means a lag of about two years from project identification to the disbursement of funds . That accelerated pace can only be sustained if much of the tenuous Palestinian policy-making capability is diverted to dealing with the aid procedures . <p> If the principal aim of the aid is to lay a basis for sustainable development in the medium-term , then current procedures are appropriate . That seems to be motivating the donor agencies which are emphasizing efficiency and accountability , desirable goals that take time to achieve . If , on the other hand , the aim is to influence the public in favor of the peace accord now before opinions gel , then the most efficient procedure would be to disburse cash to the PLO , to reinforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes . Cash payments would probably be money wasted economically and well-spent politically . Seamer Huleileh , a top official with the official PLO aid agency ( the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development , or PECDAR ) , was doing more than pleading his organization 's cause when he said the following : <p> We should be professional from a political point of view , not from an economic point of view . Money spent on salaries does n't create development , but it creates survival , it creates momentum for peace and for the agreement. 17 <p> To date , the aid program is repeating the errors made in the former Soviet Union : large amounts are promised and small amounts are delivered . Unfulfilled expectations create popular bitterness and distrust of the West . In his analysis of the negative effects of the West 's aid program , Jeffrey Sachs has created controversy by clinging to the illusion that the West could still meet Russian expectations for huge amounts of aid disbursed quickly. 18 <p> As is the aid program in the former Soviet Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political . In the former case , the aid is meant to consolidate popular support for a pro-Western and pro-market orientation ; in the latter , it is meant to increase public support for peace with Israel . In other words , aid for the West Bank and Gaza is not aid for cooperation . Indeed , foreign donors face a paradox if they wish to finance both Palestinian development and economic cooperation . The more funding provided for Palestinian development , the more resources are available to develop autonomous Palestinian institutions which reduce the degree of cooperation necessary between the Israeli and Palestinian economies . The fact is that in some cases , autonomous Palestinian institutions -- operating on a smaller scale at higher cost than their Israeli counterparts -- may be a better way to promote peace between the two peoples . Consider , for instance , a Gaza port capable of handling most of the imports for the West Bank and Gaza . That would probably be less economical than making fuller use of Haifa and Ashdod , but it would reduce the quarrels over the disbursement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exports . Furthermore , a Gaza port might be able to secure Jordanian business that would be less likely to go to an Israeli port . The point of this example is that there may be times when foreign donors justifiably decide to finance Palestinian development even though that development may be at the expense of economic cooperation with Israel and of economic rationality , especially in those few cases where a separate Palestinian facility may offer political advantages ( such as reducing potential conflicts with Israelis over shared facilities ) that outweigh these economic factors . <p> While the principal aim of aid is not to promote economic cooperation , aid could also play an important role in encouraging cooperation . Middle East economic cooperation is held back both by political suspicions and by cruel economics : How to distribute the costs and benefits ? All too often , governments refuse to move on projects from which their country would profit because their neighbors would also benefit without paying . Each of the region 's governments faces a serious deficit problem , and none is eager to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own citizens . It is difficult to find a technically or politically acceptable means to allocate the costs of a project such as a dam , which provides several countries with a variety of benefits ( not all of them easily measured in dollars ) , such as reducing the risk of floods , generating electricity and providing water for irrigation . Financial disputes have been an irritant in joint international projects around the world , even when the countries concerned are on good terms ; they are likely to be all the worse when the partners start out being suspicious of each other . <p> In order to avoid such disputes , an international financing facility could be created to fund ( lower interest rates , longer maturity ) projects that benefit several countries with softer terms than projects that benefit only one country . The facility could be administered by the World Bank . To make the facility attractive to borrowers , it would need grant contributions that it could combine with market-rate borrowing of its own . <p> A regional cooperation facility is better targeted and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization would face many problems , not the least of which would be Israeli participation . Despite the recent political advances , it would be difficult to secure Arab participation if Israel were a member , and it would be effectively impossible to secure U.S. participation if Israel were not a member . In addition , most of the states in the region , already heavily indebted , are not in a position to borrow at market interest rates . Furthermore , a Middle East Development Bank could easily be diverted from financing regional cooperation into financing ordinary development projects -- projects for which the states of the region already have ample sources of finance , given the limited amount of additional foreign debt they can afford . <p> In sum , aid could play a role in promoting Arab-Israeli economic and political cooperation and in increasing support for the peace process , especially by showing impoverished Palestinians that peace can bring prosperity . However , the potential for aid to play such a role is not as great if the emphasis is on economic rationality rather than on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the hopes are high for benefits from cooperation is water . Water usage is a particular problem in the Middle East and North Africa , a region that uses 73 percent of this scarce resource while the world average is a mere 7 percent , according to a recent World Bank study. 19 Unfortunately , in many countries security of water supplies stirs emotions and political sensitivities that impede rational analysis . As a result , agreement on any regional water project may be hard to achieve . It would be unrealistic to count on water usage as the starting point for regional cooperation . <p> Nevertheless , it may be possible to get the region 's governments to agree informally to accelerate announced plans for the use of market mechanisms for solving the water problem . Economists throughout the area have pointed out that the water shortage is hardly surprising : Consumers are charged a price far below the cost of production . That is a recipe for a shortage , no matter what the good concerned . Consumers -- which means primarily farmers , since agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and North Africa -- have little incentive to adopt water-saving techniques . Farmers could preserve their income levels , while cutting water use by 50 percent or more , through a combination of changing the mix of crops grown and investing in water-saving technologies . <p> It is no exaggeration to say that the water problem is a price problem . Recognizing this , each country in the region has announced its intention to reform water pricing . But plans all too often succumb to political pressures from the beneficiaries of current ( implicit ) subsidies . It may be worthwhile to develop a joint declaration of water policy reform , which would recognize that reform in one country could improve the water supply for others . <p> Large-scale water projects , such as large dams , desalinization plants or canals , to take advantage of the difference in elevation between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea , should be carefully evaluated to determine if the costs are justifiable . Using dams as an example , the international experience -- including the Aswan High Dam or many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inefficiency and low rates of return on capital invested . Perhaps given the emotions involved , it would be worthwhile spending $5 billion to flood the Levant with water from desalinization plants , the most expensive but politically most accessible source . That amount would pay for more than a sufficient number of dams and desalinization plants to meet water demand at the current subsidized prices , which encourage wasting water . But before paying such a high price for a largely irrational fear , let us start with smaller scale projects to see if they can improve public confidence about water supplies . A few reasonable proposals have been advanced for medium-sized ( $500 million ) multilateral projects , such as storing winter flood waters behind dams ( much of the region 's waterflow is lost during brief floods ) . 20 <p> One example of a medium-sized multilateral regional water project is the Unity Dam on the Yarmuk River . The dam has a long history : The United States offered to finance this project in the early 1970s because it would benefit several of the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Israel . Although a well-prepared project proposal exists , Jordan and Israel have yet to agree on terms for the project . Jordan may agree to concessions if the international community were to offer concessional financing in return for Jordan 's agreeing to allow Israel and the Palestinian areas access to the project 's benefits . <p> For both the medium-sized and the larger projects , the criteria for determining whether the costs are justifiable should be political as well as economic . The two categories of criteria , however , can lead to different results . Consider , for instance , the longstanding dream of generating electricity by capitalizing on the difference in elevation between the open sea and the Dead Sea ( the potential to generate electricity being a function of the elevation from which the water falls ) . Such a project would make more sense politically if it fully involved the Jordanians rather than holding them at the periphery -- implying preferential treatment to the " Red-Dead " route from the Red Sea over the " Med-Dead " route from the Mediterranean , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EAST STRUCTURES <p> Compared to the high-profile water issue , the issue of ending Israel 's isolation within international organizations is more mundane . There are numerous international institutions with regional affiliates or with administrative divisions along regional lines . Few classify Israel as a Middle Eastern nation ; instead , Israel usually is categorized within the European group for administrative purposes . The reason is not one of bureaucratic convenience , but rather , politics . Specifically , it is the unwillingness of Arab states to consider Israel a legitimate Middle East state . Sometimes the distinction is not particularly important to the work of the organization , as is the case at the International Monetary Fund . But in organizations that concern themselves with issues that cross borders- covering everything from allocating the radio spectrum to combatting infestations of pests -- Israel should be considered a Middle East state . <p> In addition , it should be possible for Israeli nationals to sit down with their Arab colleagues to discuss technical issues under the auspices of international organizations . That may require meetings in Egypt or outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to issue visas for short visits to experts who are Israeli nationals traveling for international meetings . Certainly , it is inappropriate for multinationals to initiate new technical fora with the clear intention of excluding Israel . <p> An example of what not to do is the World Bank 's sponsorship of the Initiative to Encourage Economic Research on the Middle East , which led to the founding of the Economic Research Forum for the Arab Countries , Iran and Turkey in June 1993 . The material sent out by the new organization provided inadequate rationales for excluding Israel , claiming Israel had different economic problems from the rest of the region . The organization can not even bring itself to say that Israeli scholars are welcome to participate ; instead , it makes the ambiguous statement , " All those who can contribute to the goals of Forum would be free to participate . " 22 World Bank Vice-President Caio Koch-Weser , in his address to the Forum 's founding conference , had the gall to center his remarks on openness as the key defining characteristic of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The industrial nations and private foundations that funded the initiative , and now the Forum , should learn from this experience that they have to insist as a sine qua non on Israeli participation in Middle East organizations they support . EXAMPLE OF COOPERATION POTENTIAL : TOURISM <p> To end on an upbeat note , let me offer an example of an industry with good prospects for growth through regional cooperation. 23 Tourism offers promising opportunities for demonstrating the material reward from Arab-Israeli peace . Much of the reward will come automatically , as a more peaceful environment encourages more visitors and stimulates private sector investment in tourism facilities . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres decried that " the region has not fulfilled its potential for tourism , " and pointed out that " the root of the problem is violence . " 24 Tourism is extraordinarily sensitive to the state of personal security , real and perceived . Should there be a wave of publicity about attacks on individuals , for either political or plain criminal motivations , tourism drops rapidly , as it did in Egypt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of national security , meaning not only war and peace but also the international perception of how a country fits into the international scene . Tourists -- vacationers and business travelers -- would rather visit a country with a government which promotes peace and upholdes justice . On both the personal and national security fronts , Israel suffered image problems in the 1980s , between the war in Lebanon from 1982 to 1983 and the intifada from 1987 on . In contrast , Egypt benefited from Camp David and the subsequent blossoming relationship with the West . <p> One factor that makes tourism a promising area for intergovernmental cooperation is that Israel and its neighbors are on a more equal par regarding tourism than in almost any other economic field . In many areas in which functional cooperation has been proposed , Israel is the giant that , no matter how well-intentioned , has the potential to overwhelm its neighbors . But in the tourism industry , this is not the case . In 1991 , Israel ( including East Jerusalem ) had 28,515 hotel rooms , while Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , it is striking to realize that Amman has more hotel rooms than West Jerusalem , and that there are more hotel rooms on Nile River cruise boats than in Tel Aviv and West Jerusalem combined. 26 Compared to the 18-to-1 ratio of GDP between Israel and Jordan , the 4-to-1 ratio of hotel rooms is psychologically less troubling to the Jordanian side . Similarly , Egypt has a 2-to-1 ratio of GDP with Israel but almost a 2-to-1 advantage over Israel in tourism . <p> Tourism cooperation has the potential to create additional tourism for each country , rather than divert the existing flow of tourists from one country to another . The Middle East offers good prospects for " regional tourism , " or visits to sites in a variety of countries in a region . Officials and members of the business community interviewed in the region agree that American Jews and Europeans are poor targets for such regional tourism : The former are mostly interested in visiting Israel , and the latter are more disposed to spend their vacations in one spot rather than visiting numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package trips to one tour resort ) . That leaves Japanese and North American non-Jewish vacationers as the best targets for such regional tourism . To increase regional tourism from North America and the western Pacific will require marketing the region as a whole . An American or Japanese considering a vacation may not realize the geographical proximity of the key historic sites in the Levant and how easy it is to see the Pyramids , the Holy Land , the Jewish state , Roman ruins and the exotic Arab markets -- all in two weeks . Until now , there has been little government encouragement for such regional marketing . Though a fair amount of regional marketing is done by private travel agents for combination Israel-Egypt trips , these efforts have not had the coordination ( e.g. , a single marketing theme and slogan ) that could be achieved through a government-sponsored campaign . In November 1993 , the Egyptian , Israeli and Turkish tourism ministers signed an accord creating the East Mediterranean Tourism Authority. 27 Even if other governments believe it is inappropriate to join such an organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed marketing campaign . <p> Tourism cooperation offers several advantages from the perspective of aid donors . First of all , the tourism industry may be the best prospect for Palestinian economic development , at least in the short run . The tourism industry in the Levant is already so large relative to the Palestinian economy that if the West Bank ( or , less plausibly , Gaza ) were to capture even a small share in tourism growth , the impact could be quite significant . If the Palestinian areas received revenues equal to 5 percent of the 1992 Levant and Turkish tourism receipts ( for example , about $400 million ) , that would be equal to 16 percent of the GNP of the West Bank and Gaza . Indeed , a number of observers -- Palestinian and non-Palestinian alike -- see tourism as one of the best prospects for the growth of the West Bank economy . Some of the Palestinian businessmen and officials interviewed feel there will be large-scale Muslim religious tourism to Jerusalem , perhaps in the hundreds of thousands per year . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , because they would prefer to stay in Palestinian hotels and some could be attracted to other religious sites in Bethlehem and Hebron . Palestinians also expect to gain considerable revenue from Gulf Arabs by exploiting the West Bank 's cool summer weather and relaxed social atmosphere , transforming the area into a Gulf tourism destination as it was before 1967 . Also , Gulf Arabs who are reluctant to overnight in Tel Aviv may feel more comfortable staying in the West Bank and making day trips to the beach and stores , or evening trips to nightclubs and the like . <p> A second advantage of tourism cooperation is that it offers a highly visible infrastructure project of the sort politicians love . That project is the development of a multinational airport at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba , where Israel and Jordan each have fewer than 20 miles of shore surrounded by Egypt on the one side and Saudi Arabia on the other . Israel is considering building a new airport -- which seems like an extravagance given that there are already four airports within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Germany over the dual-administered airports in Geneva and Basel would be use useful to consider in this case . The ideal would be one airport with three exits at the terminal ; one through a door marked " Egypt , " one through a door marked " Israel , " and one through a door marked " Jordan . " Special , fenced-off roads would then bring travelers from those doors to the country concerned . The payoffs could be large : Economically , only one airport would be needed instead of three , while politically , the day-to-day administration of a joint facility would create professional ties that could undermine mutual suspicions . The international community could sweeten the pot by offering to finance on concessional terms an Israeli payment to Jordan or Egypt to cover Israeli use of the existing runway . Jordan or Egypt might find the offer tempting , because the money would be a windfall ( the runways already exist ) . Jordan probably has the greater incentive to cooperate since , like Israel , it has a narrow coast line that makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn would sustain an airport where flights could arrive directly from Europe ( as distinct from the existing airports that mostly serve short-distance hops from the region 's main national airports ) . Egypt has a long coast in the Sinai that it can develop on its own , quite possibly sustaining its own long-distance airport . <p> A third advantage of cooperation in tourism is the potential to relax the hair triggers on the borders . The best zones for tourism development are precisely some of the border areas which have been largely empty to date . Consider the case of the Sinai peninsula , which Egypt has targeted as one of the principal regions , if not the main region , for its tourism development in the next decade . During the entire period from the British occupation of the 1880s through 1967 , Sinai was isolated from the rest of Egypt . A special permit was needed to visit the region . The area was empty except for the military presence ; it was a battlefield waiting to be used . CONCLUSION : HOW MUCH CAN ECONOMIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order about whether economic cooperation in fact contributes to peace . Consider the history of the most extensive case of Arab-Israeli economic cooperation , namely , the Palestinians working in Israel . The employment of 140,000 Palestinian commuters inside Israel knit together the two economies and did more than any other development to bring individuals from the two communities into person-to-person contact . The need to communicate on the job was a major reason to learn the other community 's language ; the daily contact taught much about the other 's customs and habits . However , close contact engendered by economic cooperation has not been effective in overcoming the deep animosity between the communities and it may even have contributed to this animosity . Relations between the Jewish and Palestinian communities seriously deteriorated by the early 1990s , with individual Palestinians attacking Jews at random and visa versa . The 1993 closure of the occupied territories , designed to forestall such attacks , was popular among Israelis . The attacks and the closure made Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and much of the West Bank more acceptable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those who expect economic cooperation to bring peace to the region . <p> The most important economic contributor to Middle East peace may not be cooperation but West Bank and Gaza development . The New York Times caught the mood in the region in its headline , " Economic Ties Are Regarded as Key to Israeli-PLO Pact . " 28 The peace accord has the best chances for securing the approval of skeptical Palestinian public opinion if it can deliver higher incomes -- especially if incomes increase quickly before public attitudes gel . Raising Palestinian incomes by a noticeable margin should be a relatively simple task , given that the West Bank/Gaza GNP is less than $3 billion . The best options are cash aid to the PLO and immediate Israeli trade liberalization . However , neither is likely to happen . The international donors are emphasizing efficiency , accountability and coordination , which take time to achieve . The Israeli government is swayed by lobbying from those domestic groups that would be hurt if restrictions were lifted quickly . Current donor and Israeli policies are laying the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the donor and Israeli economic policies are doing little to help peace take root . Indeed , grandiose public investment proposals and high-profile aid promises to the Palestinians may be politically counterproductive by creating unrealistic expectations that , when dashed , could feed a public backlash against the accords . <p> Unrealistic expectations are a grave danger to the real but qualified potential for economic cooperation between Israel and Arab countries . Grand hopes for the future should not be allowed to get in the way of practical plans for the present . Nor should grand projects be allowed to absorb so much of the available financing that there is not enough for small-scale projects with a potentially larger social impact , such as the creation of and investment in labor-intensive industries for unemployed Palestinians . Realism suggests that we concentrate on what can be obtained now , even if that requires us to take imperfect steps ; what matters most is the appearance of progress . The priority should be on the immediate disbursement of aid , without the comprehensive preparatory studies and careful accounting that aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation as the wave of the future , then the private sector will find more ways to cooperate ( and more resources ) than the governments could ever provide . <p> Politics , not economics , will be both the main goal and the main determinant of economic cooperation . The principal barrier to cooperation is not technical matters that can be resolved through careful examination , but rather political will . Therefore , the effort spent on studies is on the whole a waste , because it delays timely agreement on small steps that create the climate of confidence vital for getting cooperation off the drawing boards and into action . We must first address political concerns about the consequences of cooperation . That may well mean proceeding first with some projects that have rather marginal economic effects . For instance , it may be desirable to finance a host of projects creating Palestinian institutions ( like an electricity company ) that are marginally profitable and for which it would have made more sense to cooperate with Israel , because assuaging Palestinian nationalism with such symbols may be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more positive note , the political taboos against Arab-Israeli economic cooperation have been broken . Broad consensus exists among Palestinian leaders for open borders with Israel , while Israelis are prepared to see the PLO assume some of the attributes of a government in regulating the West Bank and Gazan economy . Business leaders from several Arab countries are willing to visit Israel and explore joint business ventures . Israel is becoming increasingly accepted as part of the Middle East scene ; its neighbors are treating it less as a pariah country . However little or much economic cooperation may contribute to prosperity , its political impact is exciting . As translated and printed in Mideast Mirror , 16 September 1993 , p. 16 .

At the same time , computer architectures have evolved from being sequential and uniform to being parallel and heterogeneous . Nowadays , most computers have a multi-core central processing unit ( CPU ) with single instruction multiple data ( SIMD ) vector instructions and a programmable graphics processing unit ( GPU ) . These parallel devices have the potential to cope with the increasing volumes of geographic data . However , due to their programming complexity , they are widely underutilized . Modelers prefer scripting languages to parallel languages because the former provide simple abstractions that facilitate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as load balance , synchronization , communication and parallel I/O . # The first geospatial scripting language to include a comprehensive collection of raster operators was implemented by Tomlin in the 1980s , and it was based on the mathematical structure proposed by Tomlin and Berry 1 . This event marked the beginning of map algebra 2 , 3 , an algebraic formalism for the analysis of raster data . Many others followed , extending map algebra to encompass dynamic modeling 4 , 5 , evaluating new user interfaces 6 , formalizing the time dimension 7 , 8 , or contributing in other ways 9-11 . It was the simple and concise structure of scripts , where operations are applied to whole maps without explicitly iterating over the cells , that made map algebra a popular language . Although simple , map algebra becomes extremely flexible when combined with general-purpose programming structures , such as branching , looping , and callable functions . As a result , it can be used to model , for instance , hydrological simulations 12 , cost distance analysis 13 , or even environmental systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they prefer scripting for productivity , then their scripts need to be enhanced with transparent parallelism . Abundant research has targeted the parallelization of individual spatial algorithms 15 , but only a few studies have explored the parallelization of general-purpose solutions . The first attempt to parallelize map algebra was reported in 16 , using the message-passing interface ( MPI ) and based on the parallel neighborhood modeling library 17 . The pRPL library 18 was written in C++ , built upon MPI , and tested with a cellular automaton ( CA ) model for urban development . Its continuation , pRPL 2 19 , added data management , pseudo-parallel I/O , and dynamic load balancing features . Cheng et al . 20 proposed three general optimization methods for parallel CAs : parallel I/O , optimal data partitioning , and communication-compute overlapping . Wu et al . 21 tested map algebra on GPUs even before general-purpose GPU languages like CUDA and OpenCL 22 were available . The work in 23 accelerated the batch processing of raster spatial analysis by leveraging an in-memory cache and GPUs . With PaRGO 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in distributed memory , shared memory , and GPU architectures . The most recent attempt to parallelize map algebra was done by Shook et al . 25 , who used Python because of its widespread adoption . These works represent important advances in the parallelization of general-purpose solutions for the analysis of large raster data . Unfortunately , parallelism is not enough . Performance is also influenced by how far data has to travel , that is to say , by data locality 26 , 27. # Traditional map algebra frameworks neglect data locality because they are implemented as interpreters . They execute operations in order , repeatedly moving intermediate results up and down the memory hierarchy . Such a design was acceptable back when the execution of instructions was the limiting factor of performance . For example , floating-point instructions used to consume tens to hundreds of clock cycles . Computer architectures have evolved , though , and today accessing memory accounts for the major bottleneck . As a result , locality has become a critical concern , and this is visible in the recent literature . With pRPL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the memory bottlenecks suffered by pRPL 1 18 , but still considerably more time is spent on I/O than on computing . In the study by Cheng et al . 20 , the bottleneck caused by loading and communicating data motivates the study of memory-related optimizations . Wu et al . 21 discuss how the execution of individual raster operations is limited by memory bandwidth for both CPUs and GPUs . The authors of 23 observe that transferring data from disk to CPU and to GPU ruins the performance , so they implemented a two-level cache to relieve the problem . The experiments of Shook et al . 25 point to memory bandwidth saturation as the reason behind the speed-up degradation when more parallel cores are utilized . # While the existing literature indicates that memory constitutes a major bottleneck for raster spatial analysis , no map algebra implementation exists that identifies data locality as a key performance driver . We propose a compiler approach that reorganizes the execution of map algebra scripts to exploit locality . In this work , we describe a framework that follows such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets multi-core CPUs and single GPUs , while it excludes multi-GPUs and distributed memory . It covers most local , focal and zonal map algebra operations , as well as one global operation ( viewshed ) . The framework also applies spatial decomposition to deal with datasets larger than GPU and main memory . Its internal details are , moreover , transparent to the user , who simply writes sequential map algebra scripts in Python. # The rest of the paper is structured as follows . Section 2 presents the compiler approach and the components of the framework . Section 3 details a scheduler and a fusion technique , both used to reorder the execution for locality . Section 4 explores the connection between locality and parallelism , and presents the experimental results . Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses possible improvements . # A compiler approach to map algebra # Traditional map algebra implementations are interpreters . They process scripts in order , execute statements one by one , and ignore which raster operation comes next . Interpreters can not optimize beyond the scope of the operation being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent for any subsequent operation . In the context of map algebra , this means that output rasters are moved to a lower level in the memory hierarchy , where they can reside permanently . That level can be the main memory if the rasters fit there , otherwise they are written to disk . # To enable the processing of datasets larger than the main memory , rasters are commonly decomposed into smaller blocks . Figure 1a illustrates the interpreter approach in such a case . The interpretation of map algebra scripts consists of a triple loop structure where operations , blocks , and cells are iterated in order . Despite its simplicity , this program structure has deep implications with respect to data and its movement . For every operation , input rasters are moved from disk to main memory , on a block-by-block basis . For every block , cells are moved from main memory to the processor registers and are operated on in consecutive fashion . Simultaneously , the resulting output cells are moved into new blocks residing in memory . Likewise , these blocks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resides . Once the operation has finished , the interpreter moves on to the next operation and repeats the scheme . Given that most raster operations are simple and have low arithmetic intensity , most of the execution time in a typical memory hierarchy ( Fig. 2 ) is spent waiting for data to travel from disk , to CPU/GPU memories , to registers , and back to disk . # Fig. 1 : Interpreter approach ( a /b /c ) , compiler approach ( d /e /f ) , parallel optimizations ( b /c ) , data locality optimizations ( d /e ) , coarse-grained ( b /e ) , fine-grained ( c /d ) see PDF for image # Fig. 2 : Approximated memory hierarchy of a commodity desktop computer ( the bandwidth decreases in orders of magnitude as the distance between memory and processors increases ) see PDF for image # Figure 1b shows the addition of coarse-grain parallelism through the use of multi-threading . Scripts are still interpreted , but blocks are processed in parallel . This brings immediate performance benefits since the blocks are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple CPU threads saturates the disk 's bandwidth and performance stagnates soon . On the other hand , parallelism can also be applied in a fine-grained fashion , for example by using GPUs for the cells loop ( Fig. 1c ) . Unless other bottlenecks like the PCIe bandwidth strike first , performance will increase due to added parallelism . However , the GPU memory bandwidth saturates again and the GPU threads mostly wait idle . Although parallel , both solutions are still interpreters . They neglect the locality between consecutive raster operations , in which data produced by one operation is often consumed by the next . As a result , they saturate the bandwidth and can not take full advantage of the available parallel cores. # Unlike interpreters , our compiler approach first gathers a global view of the whole script in order to know the operations and their interrelationships . With that information we reorder the execution at the cell and block levels . Fusion , illustrated in Fig. 1d , moves the operations loop to the innermost part of the execution . This has the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy , all the operations are applied at once . Consequently , the intermediate memory movements are avoided and the bandwidth is not saturated . Unfortunately , fusion is not applicable in the presence of spatial data dependencies . The scheduler , on the other hand , can handle some spatial dependencies in exchange for lower bandwidth savings . It moves the operations loop just one level down ( Fig. 1e ) to reorder the execution at the block level . It saves block movements between disk and memory , but it can not prevent the movement of cells between memory and registers ( Fig. 2 ) . # Figure 1d and e show ideal situations where all operations can be reordered by one single loop transformation . However , this is not always the case for real-life scripts that mix diverse types of map algebra operations . Figure 1f shows the complexities of the reordering problem for a more realistic script . For example , focal operations present small barriers ( in the figure , shorter blue lines ) to the reordering that can disable fusion , while zonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their spatial extent , which also inhibit the scheduler . The reordering problem is discussed in more detail in section 3 . The next subsections provide an overview of the components of our framework . # Map algebra as a python script # Map algebra 2 , 3 is a scripting language for geospatial analysis and modeling using raster data . Operations in map algebra belong to one of four classes : local , focal , zonal and global . All operations in a given class conform to strict spatial patterns ( Fig. 3 ) . Local operations access single raster cells , focal operations access bounded neighborhoods , zonal operations access all cells in their zone with associative order , and global operations access potentially any cell in the raster in any order . Global operations are further divided into radial and spread operations 3 . Radial operations access straight lines of cells , while spread operations access sequences of cells given by some topological criteria ( e.g. , the water flow direction ) . Our prototype implements the subset of local , focal , zonal and radial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study ( e.g. , flow accumulation 29 , cost surface 30 ) . # Fig. 3 : Map algebra classes and their algorithmic patterns see PDF for image # Our framework is written in C++ and interfaced through Python . Common Python operators are used to express local operations ( e.g. , + , - , * , / , == , ! = , &lt; , &gt; ) while predefined functions cover the remaining focal ( e.g. , slope , aspect , flow direction ) , zonal ( e.g. , min , average ) and radial functionalities ( e.g. , viewshed ) . The framework supports simple loops with a known number of iterations at compile time and user-defined functions composed of existing operators . The use of functions enables the practice of good software engineering principles , like code reuse and modularization . Moreover , these abstractions come with no performance cost because the compiler optimizations will optimize them away . # Next , we present two sample scripts . Conway 's Game of Life 13 script in Listing 1 exemplifies the use of finite loops with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become dead or alive according to the population of their neighborhood in the previous iteration . Listing 2 computes the hillshade of a digital elevation model ( DEM ) following Horn 's formulation 31 . Based on the given azimuth and altitude of the sun , it draws a self-shadowing effect on top of the DEM that creates a sense of topographic relief . This script defines slope , aspect , and hillshade from basic raster operations for illustrative purposes . Listing 2 shows two alternative ways to access the neighborhood , with a convolution filter of 3 by 3 cells ( lines 5 to 8 ) or with individual accesses per neighbor ( lines 12 to 14 ) . Note how both Python scripts are devoid of parallel semantics , facilitating their easy sequential development . # Listing 1 : Life script 13 in Python see PDF for image # Listing 2 : Hillshade script 31 in Python see PDF for image # Dependency graph # Figure 4 illustrates the components of the framework via a hypothetical example . When the Python script in Fig. 4a is run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a graph is created with nodes and edges representing the operations and their interrelationships . Nodes are tagged according to their inputs , outputs , type of operation and map algebra classes . Together , they consolidate the dependency graph ( Fig. 4b ) , a symbolic representation of the script . Operations with side effects in the real world , like writing to a file , trigger the execution of the graph . If the graph accumulates many nodes before this happens , then many reordering opportunities will emerge from the interrelationships between the operations . # Fig. 4 : Components and stages of the framework see PDF for image # The dependency graph is structured as a directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) in static single assignment ( SSA ) form . DAGs are common in parallel libraries 32-34 , where the nodes represent tasks and the edges indicate data dependencies . They are used to model the type of asynchronous and dynamic parallelism that fit best with the heterogeneous design of modern computers 32 . The SSA form makes the dependency chains explicit by decoupling operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimizations that will follow . The SSA DAG is the intermediate representation of our compiler approach , and its presence is required to move beyond interpretation . Next , the framework analyzes the dependency graph and generates bespoke parallel code with improved locality and superior performance . # Simplification and fusion # At this point , simplification routines are applied to the dependency graph . This results in an optimized version of the graph with fewer nodes but equivalent functionality . For this purpose , the framework applies global value numbering 36 and typical compiler techniques : arithmetic simplification , constant folding and propagation , copy propagation , common subexpression elimination and dead code elimination . Most of these techniques are applicable in Listing 2 . For example , in line 13 , arithmetic simplification discards the multiplications by zero . Constant folding and propagation occur in lines 33 to 36 . Common subexpression elimination applies to lines 18/24 , 19/25 , and 37/38 , where the function calls to hori , vert and slope are repeated for the same inputs . The framework sees through the abstractions and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different function scopes . These simplifications are straightforward , but important , as most scripts offer opportunities for these types of optimizations. # Fusion is performed after simplification . As we explain in more detail in subsection 3.1 , fusion merges consecutive raster operations into groups . Consequently , the fused operations are applied to the cells at once , as if the operations loop had been moved to the innermost part of the execution ( Fig. 1d ) . Fusion augments the intermediate representation with a new structure , the grouped graph ( Fig. 4c ) . Groups are tagged via the aggregation of inputs , outputs , and map algebra classes of their nodes . Although different classes can be grouped together , often one dominates the others . Groups also inherit the directed and acyclic dependencies . Next , the grouped graph is used to generate parallel code . # Code translation with skeletons # The groups are translated into parallel kernel codes that run on OpenCL devices . The translation stage is based on code skeletons 37-39 . Skeletons are code templates describing algorithmic patterns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel pattern for each map algebra class and for every pattern we design a skeleton . In this way , feeding the skeletons with the groups results in the translated kernel codes ( Fig. 4d ) . The design and evaluation of the skeletons is beyond the scope of this study , although they can be explored in the source code repository 28. # Map algebra operations display a variety of parallel patterns . Local , focal and zonal operations follow the map , stencil , and reduction patterns , respectively 37 . Radial operations display a two-dimensional scan pattern ( e.g. , prefix sum ) , in which every cell depends on the output value of the previous cells in the radial direction . These parallel patterns are common across domains and applicable to other problems aside from map algebra 40 . Global operations not covered in our prototype present their own parallel patterns , and their inclusion requires the design of new skeletons . # Kernel compilation and task composition # The kernel code is handed to the OpenCL compiler to generate executable device code ( Fig. 4e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parallel devices , although we focus on multi-core CPUs and GPUs . The OpenCL compiler performs important routines , such as register allocation , instruction selection , and instruction scheduling 41 . The length of the groups and the design of the skeletons affect these routines , and therefore , the quality of the device code too . The compilation takes little time , typically less than a second . However , this can be problematic for very small datasets if the compilation dominates the execution time . To mitigate this issue , the framework caches the device code so that the kernels are compiled just once , but reused as needed . # A task containing the executable device code is created for each group of nodes . Tasks can contain specialized versions of the kernel and device codes for each type of OpenCL device . For instance , the GPU skeletons are specialized to exploit the on-chip scratchpad memory . The execution of tasks produces new raster data that is consumed by subsequent tasks or written to disk as the final results . When a task is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution . The aggregation of the tasks expands the intermediate representation with the task graph ( Fig. 4f ) . # Spatial decomposition and scheduling # As the resolution of geographical datasets continues to increase , it is becoming more and more common that the computer 's main memory is unable to accommodate all that data at once . To circumvent this problem , the framework applies spatial decomposition and subdivides the rasters into blocks of adjacent cells . Simultaneously , tasks are also subdivided to form jobs . A job is a pair ( task , block ) , and it constitutes the executable and scheduling unit ( Fig. 4g ) . Jobs depend on the same input rasters as their parent task , but only for their particular block . For certain map algebra classes , such as focal , jobs also require their neighboring blocks . This occurs because focal operations access their neighboring cells , known as halos , and the outermost halos belong to the neighboring blocks ( Fig. 5a ) . # Fig. 5 : a ) Focal jobs require their neighboring blocks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewshed operation ( radial class ) follows an outward expansion from the observer see PDF for image # Jobs are standalone , executable units that can run in parallel , but they are not free of restrictions . To ensure correctness , the order of jobs is constrained based on the their data dependencies . An example can be seen in viewshed analysis 42 , where the visibility of any target cell depends on the obstacles between the target and the observer . This constrains the execution of radial jobs to an outward expansion order from the observer towards the borders ( Fig. 5b ) . In spite of these restrictions , typically numerous orderings exist that preserve correctness . The scheduler , supported by an in-memory cache , exploits this opportunity and reorders the jobs for better locality . Fig. 4h shows the execution order set by the scheduler , as if the operations loop had been moved below the blocks loop ( Fig. 1e ) . The scheduler is described in more detail in subsection 3.2. # Workers and execution # The framework spawns several worker threads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheduler , query the in-memory cache for data blocks , perform parallel I/O , issue the kernels to the OpenCL devices , and notify tasks about the completion of jobs . The scheduler maintains a work queue for active jobs ready to be executed . The cache brings the needed blocks to memory and keeps them there for future requests . The execution of jobs produces new blocks , which become inputs for the next jobs . The notified tasks release those jobs whose input dependencies have now been met . These jobs become active and they join the work queue . The scheduler reorders the work queue for locality , and the cycle is repeated . # The workers act concurrently for better performance , which on the one hand enables the overlapping of computation and I/O , but on the other creates complex race conditions . Workers interacting with shared resources , like querying the work queue or searching the cache , require mutual exclusion . Maintaining thread-safe , yet efficient , data structures and routines is critical for the performance . If too much synchronization overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , therefore , a tradeoff between sophisticated logic and computational cost . For instance , meticulous caching strategies may not be advantageous if they bring large overhead . # Reordering for locality # Current trends in hardware architectures are leading to increasing numbers of parallel processors . Nowadays , trillions of floating point operations per second ( teraflops ) are feasible using a single GPU processor . However , despite the increase in parallelism , processors still need data , and their ability to move data is improving at a much slower rate 27 . In fact , the cost of moving data is relatively increasing with respect to its processing , and as a result , data locality is becoming paramount . Unfortunately , locality can not be exploited by making superficial changes to existing codes ; instead , it requires a rethinking of algorithms . Keeping up with the increasing parallelism requires profound changes to the organization of algorithms , from compute-centric to data-centric 26. # The parallel transition and the escalation of spatial data are shifting the performance bottleneck of map algebra from computation to memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a map algebra implementation needs to target locality first . However , traditional solutions can not exploit locality because they lack a global view of the scripts . Conversely , our framework constructs an intermediate graph representation that enables the use of the scheduler and fusion . These techniques shorten the reuse distance between data producer and data consumer raster operations . As a result , data is more often found at a higher memory level and the cost of accessing data is reduced . Fusion and the scheduler present different action scopes . While the former targets on-chip memories ( i.e. , registers , caches , scratchpads ) , the latter addresses the rest of the memory hierarchy ( Fig. 2 ) . # Fusion # Fusion is an important code optimizations technique , which compiler theory describes as collapsing consecutive and dependent loops . It is called loop fusion if applied to CPUs 43 , kernel fusion if applied to GPUs 44 , and stream fusion in functional programming languages 45 . A detailed study on the complexity of fusion is given by Darte 46 . Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search for locality . Examples of such fields are linear algebra 44 , database query languages 47 , functional GPU languages 48 , machine learning 49 , and array programming languages 50 . We bring fusion to map algebra in order to exploit the data locality arising from the relations between consecutive raster operations . # Recall how the nodes of the dependency graph represent the application of map algebra operations to rasters ( Fig. 4b ) , and how this is essentially achieved with loops over the cells ( Fig. 1a ) . Therefore , if fusion consists of collapsing loops , then our fusion is equal to the grouping of nodes ( Fig. 4c ) . Suppose we have two chained nodes , A and B ( Fig. 6a ) . Fusion merges them into a larger unit , namely AB , thereby avoiding the temporal raster resulting from A and consumed by B. This simple optimization is impossible for an interpreter because it can not see beyond the scope of the operation currently being executed . Additionally , fusion enables better machine code generation since larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 . On the other hand , loop-carried dependencies ( i.e. , spatial dependencies in our context ) prevent the application of fusion 43. # Fig. 6 : a ) Pipe fusion of a producer and a consumer operation ; b ) flat fusion of consumers sharing a common input ; c ) invalid fusion that breaks the acyclic property of the DAG see PDF for image # Fusibility of map algebra operations # We categorize fusion into two types . Pipe fusion merges operations with a producer-consumer relationship ( Fig. 6a ) , while flat fusion merges operations sharing a common input ( Fig. 6b ) . Pipe fusion and flat fusion can overlap ( e.g. , B and C in Fig. 6c ) , in which case pipe fusion is given preference . Pipe fusion saves both read and write memory operations , while flat fusion only saves reads , hence this priority . On the other hand , flat fusion is only limited by the skeletal compatibility of the operations while pipe fusion is also restricted by their spatial reach . Transformations that break the acyclic property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 6c ) . # Table 1 lists the validity of pipe fusion and flat fusion for each pair of map algebra classes , that is , it lists their fusibility . These rules originate from the application of parallel programming to the map algebra patterns and may be inferred by inspection . In brief , operations with a narrow spatial reach ( local , focal ) or static order ( radial ) are more fusible than operations with an extensive spatial reach ( zonal ) or dynamic order ( spread ) ( see Fig. 3 ) . We designate fusion as available when it is valid and provides clear performance improvements , as unavailable when it breaks data dependencies or is detrimental to the performance , and as compromising when it is valid but presents performance tradeoffs . Note that this classification derives from the judgment of the authors and somewhat different rules might be possible . # Table 1 : Fusibility of map algebra operations ( with pipe fusion the producers are in the left while the consumers are in the top ; flat fusion has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Local # Focal # Zonal # Radial # Spread # FLAT # Local # Focal # Zonal # Radial # Spread # Local # # # # # # Local # # # # # # Focal # # # # # # Focal # # # # # # Zonal # # # # # # Zonal # # # # # # Radial # # # # # # Radial # # # # # # Spread # # # # # # Spread # # # # # # Available : fusion is valid and beneficial # Unavailable : fusion is invalid or prejudicial # Compromising : fusion is valid but not always favorable , depending on the devices and the operations # The architecture of the parallel devices affects the fusibility as well . For instance , global operations present complex dependencies that require synchronization barriers between the parallel threads . The GPU architecture does not allow the use of global barriers within kernels , and can only synchronize at a local scope , limiting the fusibility . In contrast , CPUs can handle synchronization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of fused operations and the resources shared by the threads can also impose limits . For instance , large GPU kernels require many registers and much scratchpad memory per parallel thread . Exhausting these shared resources limits the occupancy of GPUs 44 , thus excessive fusion could decrease performance . # A frequent case of compromising pipe fusion is the merging of consecutive focal operations . Figure 7 shows an example with three focal operations , each with a neighborhood of 3 x 3 cells . Computing the central block in the 3rd operation requires having access to the previous central block and its halos , which in turn must access previous halos that are farther away . This backward propagation has the effect that subsequent pipe fusions of focal operations always generate extensive overlappings in the outer halos . This overlap affects all blocks , causes redundant computation , and escalates quickly with the levels of fusion . Consequently , a break-even point exists , after which redundant computation outweighs the gains in data locality . For this reason , pipe fusing focal operations presents complex tradeoffs between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pipe fusing focal operations presents tradeoffs between locality , parallelism and recomputation 51 see PDF for image # In this study , we are not exploring the search space of fusions and their tradeoffs . Instead our prototype implements a greedy strategy that starts from the output nodes of the script ( i.e. , write ) and fuses nodes two by two , in bottom-up order and according to the rules in Table 1 . While ascending the graph , the fusion routine tries to merge as many nodes as possible into the current group without evaluating the effects of such a decision . We do not merge operations when fusion creates cycles , is invalid , or is compromising . Neither do we set limits to the extension of groups ; therefore , the fusion routine is not concerned with exhausting resources . This is a greedy approach that may overlook the optimal fusion strategy , although it behaves adequately for the scripts tested in section 4. # Scheduler # The scheduling technique employed in this study relates to the field of external-memory algorithms 52 . These algorithms use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I/O data movements rather than in computer operations . To reduce the complexity , they follow more efficient orders of execution that minimize the I/O . External-memory techniques have been successfully applied to spatial algorithms aimed at large raster datasets , for instance in drainage network analysis 53 and viewshed analysis 54 . Similarly to these studies , our scheduler rearranges the execution of jobs into orders that minimize memory movements along the memory hierarchy . It reduces transfers from disk , to host memory , to device memory , and vice versa ( Fig. 2 ) . To do so , the scheduler utilizes an in-memory cache and space-filling curves . # In-memory cache # The framework caches recently read blocks in order to avoid reloading them if requested a short time later . Likewise , recently computed blocks are not immediately evicted from memory in case of future reads . Cached temporal blocks that have already been used by all their dependent jobs are permanently discarded . Generally , all blocks are cached ; when memory becomes full , the least recently used ( LRU ) blocks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out concurrently with the execution of jobs and without interrupting them . Some thread-safe data structures are necessary , like a hashed directory of cache entries to keep track of the cached blocks , and a linked list of the LRU entries . Figure 8 presents a high-level view of the cache . If a device is not involved in the computation , its cache remains inoperative ( e.g. , CPU Cores in Fig. 8 ) . # Fig. 8 : In-memory cache system ( the multi-core CPU is inoperative in this example ) see PDF for image # In the context of map algebra , caching is particularly critical for the performance of GPU devices 23 . Discrete GPUs are connected through a PCI-Express bus , which has considerably lower bandwidth than does GPU memory ( Fig. 2 ) . If blocks are not cached , then discrete GPUs wait idle while data is being transferred over the PCIe , and this ruins their performance advantage over CPUs 21 . Even integrated GPUs , which share the physical memory with the host and are not connected through PCIe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most importantly , caching blocks at host level prevents costly transfers from disk , and both GPUs and CPUs benefit from this caching. # At device level , the cache entries are allocated in a pool of OpenCL memory objects and are actively managed by the framework . At host level , the data is held in main memory by the Linux Page Cache 55 . This is mostly done automatically , albeit it is less performant than writing a custom host cache in C++ . The cache is not inclusive , that is to say , blocks at a high level may not exist at a lower level . This design targets short-lived temporal blocks in GPU memory that are created and quickly consumed , since moving them down the PCIe would waste bandwidth . The cache is not exclusive either because blocks may concurrently reside at multiple levels . The design follows an intermediate policy that targets simplicity and efficiency . More sophisticated cache policies are possible so long as the extra logic does not incur too much overhead . # Space-filling curves # All active jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve ( SFC ) . Following SFCs when accessing multidimensional data leads to a more efficient utilization of hierarchical memories 56 , which enhances the performance of the in-memory cache . In particular , we employ the Z-order curve 57 . Recall how in Fig. 5b , the radial jobs followed an outward expansion order to meet their data dependencies . In Fig. 9a , the jobs are reordered using a Z-curve on a sector basis ( e.g. , the northeast sector from the starting point ) and , while the Z-curve preserves correctness , it also improves the spatial locality . The Z-curve is used to reorder jobs in their spatial ( i.e. , block-level ) and operational ( i.e. , task-level ) dimensions ( Fig. 4h ) . This reordering is constrained by the spatial reach of the map algebra classes , and the final execution order looks as if the operations loop had been split by multiple barriers ( Fig. 1f ) . # Fig. 9 : a ) Reordering of radial jobs ( e.g. , viewshed ) with a Z-curve per sector ; b ) reordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their spatial and operational dimensions see PDF for image # A scenario where SFCs are remarkably beneficial occurs when chaining a series of focal operations , as seen in Fig. 9b . This is a common workload in cellular automata 58 , 59 and environmental simulations 4 . This type of forward-in-time simulations creates short-lived temporal blocks at every time step that are immediately consumed by the next iteration . With SFCs , most temporal blocks in GPU memory are quickly discarded , only some are evicted to host memory , and few or none are written to disk . If , on the other hand , all jobs in one time iteration were scheduled together , as is done by interpreted map algebras , then the temporal blocks would suffer from long reuse distance , causing memory movements that bottleneck the execution . # Shortcomings of locality # Optimizing for locality is not always feasible . Reordering is most beneficial when scripts are composed of numerous and simple raster operations . If the loop in Fig. 1 only includes one operation , then no reordering is possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into meters , which just requires one multiplication . Even scripts with abundant operations might benefit little from reordering , for instance , if all their operations have a large spatial reach , like zonals , or if they present complex dependencies , like globals . Moreover , fusion is already present in some raster library functions . For example , when library developers write a typical hillshade function , they merge by hand the slope and aspect equations into the same loop , manually achieving the benefits of fusion . # Nonetheless , these shortcomings do not devalue our compiler approach , as most non-trivial scripts present many reordering opportunities . Furthermore , manual fusion is not a perfect solution either because it is not composable . Therefore , even a slight change to a manually fused hillshade function would require a full rewrite of the code . However , library developers can not fuse by hand all the infinite variants of a function somebody might need . Consequently , modelers must resort to the elemental local and focal operations to compose their hillshade version . However , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from memory bottlenecks . In contrast , our approach is composable and efficient . In Listing 2 our hillshade function is composed of the elemental operations available to the modeler , and this is dynamically compiled to always generate efficient fused code . # On the other hand , finding the optimal reordering that maximizes locality is a known NP-hard problem in both fusion 43 and scheduling 60 . The optimal strategy depends on the map algebra operations , their interrelationships and the available computer resources , resulting in a large search space . In this study , we did not attempt to find optimal reorderings and only use simple greedy approaches , namely Table 1 and Z-order . Even so , the greedy heuristics have attained satisfactory reorderings at little cost . The authors of 50 studied fusion in the context of array programming languages and found that their greedy algorithm could reach nearly optimal fusion strategies for a large set of scripts . This is encouraging , as it suggests that quick and low overhead heuristics might suffice for map algebra as well . # Framework evaluation # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used five scripts that represent common use cases in raster spatial analysis . Table 2 describes them and lists their types of operations and the number of inputs and outputs . They are composed of a distinct variety of map algebra operations , and thus optimizations influence them differently . With these scripts , we analyzed the effects of locality , revisited the case for GPUs , tested the benefits of caching , examined different machines , investigated the scalability of the framework , and compared our results to previous studies . # Table 2 : Tested map algebra scripts # Script # Description # Operations Type # In # Out # W.

While GPUs or powerful CPUs will not help , the locality optimizations should improve its performance . The Statistics script requires five time less I/O movements and performs more operations than the previous script , but it is still memory-bound . GPUs might accelerate this script after the locality optimizations . The Hillshade script presents numerous transcendental and floating-point operations and becomes compute-bound after fusion ; therefore , it should benefit from the use of GPUs . The Life script starts with a randomly generated raster and does not load any input , which increases its arithmetic intensity . The succession of focal operations limits fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Z-curve . Our framework implements the radial class similarly to the Xdraw algorithm 42 , 61 , which visits cells once and presents regular memory accesses . As a result , the Viewshed script is not computationally very intensive , but rather memory-bound. # Our principal machine was an AMD Kaveri A10-7850 k APU , which we used in all of the experiments . It includes a quad-core CPU and an integrated Spectre GPU . This desktop machine has two SSD and two HDD disks in Raid0 modes and 16 GB of main memory , 3GB of which are reserved for Spectre . We utilized a second machine consisting of an Intel Ivy Bridge i7-3770 k quad-core CPU and an AMD Hawaii R9 290x discrete GPU . Our third machine included an Intel Haswell i7-4770 k quad-core CPU and an Nvidia K20c discrete GPU . The latter two machines featured similar Raid0 SSD configurations and exhibited greater computing power for both CPU and GPU . Although we only present results obtained from these particular machines , we tested others and obtained consistent results . # Parallel and locality optimizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when using multi-threading , GPUs , fusion , and scheduling . These speed-ups are measured with respect to the sequential interpreter approach , which uses one single thread and executes operations one at a time ( Fig. 1a ) . The first two optimizations represent coarse-grained parallelism at the block level with multi-threading , and fine-grained parallelism at the cell level with GPUs . The latter two optimizations exploit fine-grained locality at the cell level with fusion , and coarse-grained locality at the block level with the scheduler . The employed datasets each comprise one billion floating-point cells , occupy 4 GB , and are stored on SSD disk . The testing machine was Kaveri-Spectre . The goal of our analysis was to demonstrate that locality is as important as parallelism for the efficient execution of map algebra scripts. # Table 3 : Individual and synergistic speed-ups attained via the optimizations # Optimization/Script # Interp # Par # Par/GPU # Par/Fus # Par/Sch # Par/Fus/Sch # Par/GPU/Fus # Par/GPU/Sch # All Opt . # W.

Using multiple worker threads permits the concurrent reading , processing , and writing of blocks . These three stages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to a higher utilization of computer resources . This accelerates the scripts immediately , but now all threads interact with the slow disk . Soon , the disk 's bandwidth saturates and the speed-up stagnates . The Par/GPU column combines both forms of parallelism . Despite the reputation of GPUs , their use does not help much here because they just add more computational power to already memory-bound problems . In this case , the integrated Spectre GPU brings a small speed-up because it is exempt from PCIe transfers . However , when testing this experiment with the other machines , the change from Par to Par/GPU was negligible . # The Par/Fus column shows the high impact of fusion . All scripts profited from this locality optimization , which resulted in approximately a 4x speed-up with respect to Par alone . Hillshade was the script that benefited the most due to its numerous local and focal operations , which fuse seamlessly into a single group . The Par/Sch column presents the scheduler . Note how the results are considerably better when exploiting locality than when using GPUs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this depends on the operations and their interrelationships . Moreover , the two locality optimizations overlap to some degree ; hence , if fusion merges many operations , then the scheduler has fewer jobs to reorder . This is visible in the Weighted Summation and Statistics scripts , for which the Par/Fus/Sch column was not faster than Par/Fus . # Finally , the last three columns combine the locality optimizations with GPU acceleration . In contrast to the Par/GPU column , these last columns indicate that the use of GPUs is indeed beneficial , but only after the locality optimizations . For the Par/GPU/Fus column , all but the Weighted Summation script show sizeable speed-ups with respect to the Par/Fus column . This script is strongly memory-bound even after fusion ; therefore , using GPUs offers no advantage . The Par/GPU/Sch column reveals how the scheduler was especially beneficial for the Life script , where the focal operations inhibited fusion . The last column features all of the optimizations and achieved solid speed-ups across the five map algebra scripts , making a strong case for our compiler approach with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be made regarding the speed-up numbers . First , Table 3 leaves out seven possible columns where the multi-threaded parallelism was deactivated . These seven combinations were limited by disk bandwidth and were deemed not interesting enough for the analysis . Second , though our interpreter version is single-threaded , it employs compiler-generated vector SIMD instructions . Since modern CPUs can perform up to 8 floating-point operations per vector instruction , a more conservative interpreter not utilizing SIMD instructions would perform slower , making our speed-ups relatively higher . Third , the storage solution used in these tests was a Raid0 of SSD disks with approximately 3x the bandwidth of our HDD disks . Many studies still report results with slow HDDs , and had we done that , our speed-ups would have increased by a factor of 3 . In conclusion , the relevant results are not the numbers as such , but the evidence of data locality being critical for the performance . # Cache size effects on performance # Figure 10 presents the performance of the scheduler for different GPU cache sizes and an increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benchmark was derived from the Life script and consisted of running Listing 1 with different iteration counts in line 10 . The speed-up was measured as the relation between deactivating and activating the scheduler . All optimizations other than the scheduler were activated . The raster occupied 4 GB and was stored on an SSD disk . Five cache sizes were tested , ranging from 256 MB to 3 GB , the maximum allowed by Spectre . Note that newer GPUs can have more memory , generally up to 16 GB , but not as much as the host . # Fig. 10 : Speed-ups for different GPU cache sizes and number of focal operations reordered with the Z-curve , as shown in Fig. 9b ( all other optimizations than the scheduler are activated ) see PDF for image # Apart from the positive speed-up numbers , the most important observation was the tradeoff in the number of reordered operations . Like with fusion , there is a limit to the reordering at block level , and going too far decreases performance . As a result , for 3 GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient to reorder in groups of 16 operations , rather than reordering the 32 operations at once . Moreover , the tradeoff varies for different cache sizes , which makes the search for the optimal harder . In this study we followed greedy strategies and did not explore tradeoffs . Therefore , the scheduler simply reorders as many jobs as it finds in the work queue . In Table 3 , the Life script was run with 3GB of cache and 16 iterations ; therefore , those particular numbers correspond to the optimal scheduling . # Machine configuration effects on performance # Figure 11 benchmarks the Haswell-K20 and Ivy-Hawaii machines using their discrete GPUs . The Ivy machine was also tested without Hawaii ( named Ivy-Ivy ) to test the performance of the multi-core CPU alone . These three configurations were compared to the Kaveri-Spectre machine to find out whether faster CPUs/GPUs accelerate the execution . The data volume was 4 GB and was stored on an SSD disk . All of the machines had similar SSDs in Raid0 . All of the optimizations were activated . The speed-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaveri-Spectre and on the other machines . # Fig. 11 : Speed-ups of the alternative machine configurations with respect to the Kaveri-Spectre machine ( all parallel and locality optimizations are activated ) see PDF for image # Starting with the Weighted Summation script , a faster CPU or GPU had virtually no effect . This script is strongly memory-bound and only the memory system influences it . The Statistics , Hillshade , and Life scripts present increasing arithmetic intensity in that order . This is reflected in the difference between the CPU and GPU columns , where the speed-up of the discrete GPUs increased , while it decreased for the Ivy CPU . The Viewshed script is memory-bound because it follows the Xdraw algorithm , and thus showed little to no improvement . Life is the most compute-bound workload . With this script , the Ivy-Hawaii and Haswell-K20 machines were approximately 2x times faster than the Kaveri-Spectre machine , which was in turn 4x times faster than the Ivy-Ivy machine . This makes the discrete GPUs about 8x times faster than the multi-threaded and vectorized CPU solution . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the use of faster devices will show no advantage when memory is the main bottleneck . # Scalability to large data volumes # Table 4 shows the scalability of the framework for increasing volumes of data ( from 1 MB to 1 TB ) and different storage options ( RAM , SSD and HDD ) . In this test , all of the optimizations were activated . The life script was reduced to 4 iterations to save time when running the 1 TB workload . The execution time was measured in seconds , and at the bottom we included the average time increase factor when moving to larger data sizes . The average increase in the execution times when changing from SSD to HDD storage for a fixed data size of 10 GB was a factor of 3.24x , which approaches the difference in bandwidth between these two storage options in our Kaveri-Spectre machine . This implies that when all optimizations are active , the five scripts are mostly bottlenecked by disk bandwidth . # Table 4 : Execution times with increasing volumes of data ( all optimizations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Drive # Hard Disk Drive # 1 MB # 10 MB # 100 MB # 100 MB # 1 GB # 10 GB # 10 GB # 100 GB # 1 TB # W.

However , at least two types of overheads affected the results . To the left of Table 4 , the lack of variation in the execution times was due to the OpenCL compilation overhead , which became the main bottleneck for small data sizes . To the right of Table 4 , the large increase of 12.99x in the 1 TB column was due to the runtime overhead . Larger datasets generated more jobs and blocks for the framework to handle , which eventually impacted the performance of the host CPU . These results were achieved for a fixed block size of 1 megabyte . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeded reasonable bounds . Specifically , blocks smaller than a few kilobytes resulted in excessive runtime overhead , while blocks larger than a few megabytes reduce the availability of parallel jobs and thus decreased the reordering opportunities . It remains to be studied how to push the limits of these overheads further . # Comparison to previous works # The authors of pRPL 18 studied the parallelization of an urban CA in a cluster of 1024 CPU nodes 19 and in another cluster of 64 GPU nodes 59 . They obtained execution times of 77 s and 32 s respectively , but without including the writing of the output raster . In a previous study 62 we tested the same CA and dataset with our prototype and obtained execution times of 70 s when using a desktop computer and a single discrete GPU . Moreover , their code is written at low-level in C++ , while our script requires only 30 lines of Python code . # With PaRGO 24 , the slope operator took 0.15 s for a raster of approximately 100 millions cells , on a discrete GPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script took 0.7 s to process the same number of cells in a RAM Disk . However , our script performed more operations than just slope and we measured wall times including the I/O , memory allocation and compilation . Limiting our analysis to data transfers and kernel executions , like PaRGO , reduced the time of our Hillshade script to 0.2 s. # The last experiment in the study by Shook et al . 25 tests a hillshade algorithm with an 80 GB raster . For this experiment they used Numba , a Python library that can compile array operations to efficient machine code . Numba can basically fuse local operations within Python functions . Shook et al . included the I/O times , and since their experiment read and wrote a total of 160 GB in approximately 430 s , their disk required at least 370 MB/s of bandwidth . Running our Hillshade script with a similarly sized dataset took 217.6 s and 664 s for the SSD and HDD options , respectively . Thus , we run faster and slower because of the higher and lower bandwidth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottleneck . # Conclusions # We have presented a compiler approach to map algebra . Instead of executing operations one at a time , like interpreters , our framework first gathers a global view of the script . This makes it possible to apply locality optimizations and generate bespoke parallel code for multi-core CPUs and GPUs . The approach provided a high level of performance and scalability for large datasets without renouncing the productive scripting interface in Python . Based on our results , we conclude that data locality is critical for the performance of a map algebra implementation on modern computer architectures . For instance , GPUs are only beneficial after optimizing for locality , otherwise they mostly wait idle . # Unfortunately , optimizing for locality is not always possible . Both trivial scripts with few operations and complex scripts with sophisticated data dependencies present fewer optimization opportunities . Nonetheless , most common scripts fall in the range between these two extremes and benefit substantially from the compiler approach . Our empirical evaluation showed speed-ups from one to two orders of magnitude with respect to the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five scripts of diverse characteristics running on a desktop CPU-GPU machine . # Future improvements could enhance the fusion technique with better heuristics , explore the space of scheduling strategies or support new map algebra operations . This work targets shared memory architectures and can at most handle tens of cores , a single GPU , and up to several terabytes of data . Raising the terabyte limit requires extending the framework to multi-GPU and distributed memory architectures . OpenCL could also be replaced with the LLVM 63 compiling tool-chain . This would provide finer control of the code translation stage and help reduce the compilation overhead . Even without these improvements , our prototype already shows the great potential of the compiler approach for raster spatial analysis . # Acknowledgements # This work was supported by the Academy of Finland ( decision numbers 259557 and 259995 ) . # References # 1 .

@@4001741 Thank my fourth-grade teacher , Miss Schneider , for my introduction to Christmas . As public school teachers go , she was , I grant you , something of a religious fanatic ( among other things , she held Gospel study classes in pupils ' homes every Wednesday after school ) . I will never forget the day I sat on my front porch watching some twenty or so of my classmates follow Miss Schneider into the home of my neighbor and best friend just two doors down from me . Joining the class was " the thing to do , " and I could n't do it ; I was Jewish . To be sure , with what can only be described as conversionary zeal , Miss Schneider tried regularly to " remedy " my religious status , a project that led my parents to remove me from her classroom by February . But in December , I was still a Miss Schneider ward . And that is where I encountered Christmas . <p> I was later to find out , however , that when it came to Christmas , all my teachers were more or less Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into winter , even the most humanly sensitive , Constitution-loving , and open-minded teachers became carried away by the spirit of what we now call , euphemistically , the " holiday season . " By early November , the classroom was already being turned into a swiftly accelerating vehicle for welcoming Christmas . By late November , we had heard the Christmas story several times over . Red and green decorations floated lazily down from ceilings and doorways . A large decorated tree outfited the main hall , and a smaller one greeted visitors entering the principal 's office . In art class , you painted Christmas scenes ; in English class , you composed Christmas stories ; in music , you sang Christmas carols . A huge school-wide Christmas assembly , followed by a gala Christmas party , marked the end of the first semester , but everybody returned that night to hear the school 's crack choir present its annual Christmas concert . <p> As welcome as I was in my country , there were certain times when I suspected that as a Jew I did n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the annual Christmas fever that swept through almost everyone I knew , but passed me by . None of the Jews in my small town kept any Christmas customs in those days . The close-knit Jewish community , tiny enough to know everybody else 's business , would have looked askance at such a thing . Having a Christmas tree , for instance , would have been viewed as but one step short of apostasy . In larger communities though , a small minority of Jews did decorate their own trees , hang stockings and give gifts . It seemed the American ( if not the Jewish ) thing to do . <p> It was , and still is , no picnic explaining to your children that Jews do n't celebrate Christmas . They stare at you in disbelief . Everyone keeps Christmas , they plead . It is the topic of every television program , the display in every store window . The Radio City Music Hall features its annual Christmas spectacle and the Metropolitan Museum of Art displays Christmas artifacts . What do you mean , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grinch ? maybe Scrooge ? <p> When my children were young , a well-meaning baby-sitter looking to be creative helped each child assemble a tiny Christmas tree , made of colored paper , cellophane , and fallen branches collected from the wintry outdoors . The children beamed at us with glee when we came home . What does a rabbi 's family do with a pair of ready-made , personally constructed Christmas trees ? Certainly not call them Chanukah bushes and compound the sin of syncretism , doing injustice both to Judaism and to Christianity at the same time ( fine irony to the " Chanukah bush , " given the fact that Chanukah arose as a festival celebrating the Hasmonean fight to keep Judaism free of foreign religious influence ) . Patiently , quietly , and with all the love we could muster , we explained to our children that as much as we adored the work of their hands , the trees had to go . We were Jews ; Christmas trees were for Christians ; it would be wrong for us to have them -- wrong because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made light of Christmas . Chanukah was important for Jews ; Christmas was sacred for Christians . But you ca n't be both Jewish and Christian , and you ca n't have both Chanukah and Christmas . It is one or the other . <p> Another year , Nick , our neighbor across the way , came to the door to announce his plans to show up in everybody 's living room somewhere around midnight , dressed in his Santa Claus suit . Did we want to be included in the list of stops ? The kids would love it , he assured us . We thanked him , but reminded him we were Jews . He knew that , but explained that lots of Jews would be on his list . What does a religious commitment to Judaism have to do with keeping or not keeping Christmas ? For that matter , what does Christmas have to do with Christianity ? For Nick , as for his Jewish takers , Christmas is just a fun time with music , parties , and wishes for world peace . Go argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me who take Judaism seriously , however , that is not what Christmas is . It is a feast on the Christian calendar celebrating the incarnation of the son of God . I take seriously the religious significance Christmas has ( or should have ) for Christians . Since I 'm not a Christian , it is self-evident to me that I can not observe the occasion , not in good conscience , anyway , even though life would be a lot simpler if I could . <p> Historians tell us that Christmas was not always the cultural fulcrum that balances Christian life . There was a time when Christians knew that the paschal mystery of death and resurrection was the center of Christian faith . It was Easter that really mattered , not Christmas . only in the consumerconscious nineteenth century did Christmas overtake Easter , becoming the centerpiece of popular piety .

" It does n't matter when Chanukah falls . Since it is pegged to the Hebrew calendar , it may occur any time from late November to late December . Regardless of which it is , people wish me a " happy holiday " around December 25 , as if real holidays ought to happen then . <p> I have lit Chanukah candles happily and dutifully for almost half a century ; some of my fondest family memories consist of standing with my arms around my children as we sang Chanukah songs in the flickering candlelight . But the religious part of me regrets the fact that fewer and fewer Jews observe the High Holy Days , Shabbat , and even Passover ( which used to weigh in as everyone 's favorite ) , while more and more identify Judaism as a gift-giving cult centered on Chanukah . In any event , the Chanukah hype wo n't work It may sell merchandise , and even inspire Peter , Paul , and Mary to write " Light one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- but it wo n't make Chanukah into a Jewish version of Christmas , and it wo n't address the alienation of so many Jews who genuinely like the Christmas they see and feel all around them : a Christmas that they can not share . <p> Where I live , Christmas starts officially at the end of November , with Macy 's Thanksgiving Day parade . Cities outside New York schedule their own parades then , but Macy 's version typifies the genre . It takes no semiotic genius to get the message . The parade route winds down Broadway following its own " Yellow Brick Road " to the shopping mecca on Herald Square . Bringing up the rear , but leading the way for the folk who follow the official parade route is Santa Claus , who will soon reappear daily at malls around the country promising goodies to good little children . <p> I am no Scrooge . I like Santa Claus too . I like the Christmas music -- even the bad music -- that surrounds the Santa ritual ; I like the crisp winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the paraphernalia that make most people look forward to December 25 . I like my neighbors ' wreaths and their Christmas trees , and the mistletoe , and above all , the genuinely religious Christmas carols that you can hardly hear any more because they are being replaced by soppy songs that melt down the Christian message of this holy day as quickly as snow in a heat wave . Great music is great music , after all ; I enjoy it . <p> It is , in fact , my liking ( or not liking ) of Christmas that constitutes the key to the role of Christmas in American culture . By contrast , I neither like nor dislike Easter , just as I have no opinion of , say , Ramadan . As a Jew , I naturally evaluate my own holy days , but I generally feel compulsion to appraise the sacred calendar of others . Christmas is an exception to this rule . American mores expect me , even as a non-Christian , to welcome Christmas as a positive good in my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin . An examination of that sin will tell us a good deal about what Christmas has become . <p> I have in mind three manifestations of Christmas in popular culture . The first two are modern-day fairy tales depicting the ultimate triumph of good over evil : the Broadway hit , Annie , and what , as I write , is being billed as " the summer movie of all time , " Batman Returns . To say that both have been box-office bonanzas is to be guilty of understatement . They obviously touch something very deep in our collective cultural psyche . <p> In both , Christmas appears as a symbol of the myth of American virtue . The Batman theme is simple and direct : the forces of good arrayed against the forces of evil . Unlike real life , however , from beginning to end , and no matter how bad things appear in the middle , not a soul in the movie theater has any doubt about who the final victor will be . It is only a matter of time until Batman wins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives happily ever after . That is the nature of fairy tales . They portray things as we wish they were , not as they are- . They may be absolutely ghoulish in the hideous trials to which the heroes are exposed , but in the end , Cinderella marries the prince , Little Red Riding Hood escapes the wolf , Hansel and Gretel do n't get baked in the oven , and Batman restores order to Gotham city . <p> What makes Batman interesting for our purposes is the fact that the hero 's triumph is portrayed against the backdrop of Christmas . The entire movie is set in the Christmas season . In his last line of the film , Batman links his own success at foiling the Penguin with the underlying theme of Christmas . " Merry Christmas , " he says , and good will toward men -- and women . " Christmas thus functions as a cultural trope for the way we wish things were , or better yet , the way we like to pretend things are . In the actual world bad things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowl our land . The good-will quotient measured in the absence of ethnic , racial , and religious rivalries is rather low right now . But the myth of Christmas allows us to put aside untidy evidence from newspaper headlines and to believe instead that all 's right in Gotham . Christmas stands symbolically for a secular version of redemption : Jesus does n't save ; Batman does . If evil has been eradicated it must be Christmas , goes the logic , as in fact it is in Batman Returns . <p> The evidence from Annie is even more transparent . Annie is an orphan , who is adopted by Daddy Warbucks . Along the way , evil raises its ugly head in the shape of the manager of the orphanage and her brother , who virtually kidnap Annie by posing as her parents . But in the end , their scheme fails , and Annie returns to her wealthy benefactor . As in Batman , Annie too has been written so that it culminates in Christmas . In the very last scene , not only Annie , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warbucks ' mansion . If Batman is the myth of good conquering evil in general , Annie is the application of that myth to American values in particular . Daddy Warbucks is a self-made man , a shining example of what hard work and business enterprise will get you . Never mind the fact that he made his money as a war profiteer -- the play passes silently over the significance of his name , " Warbucks . " The point is that Warbucks made it on his own . He hobnobs with FDR and the White House crowd , gets J. Edgar Hoover to unleash the FBI in his search for Annie , and lives the life of luxury that is the stuff of the American dream . But the message of Annie is precisely that those dreams can come true , if only we are hard-working and virtuous . Annie , after all , escapes the orphanage . <p> Again , we are dealing with pure myth . In real life , almost no one is self-made any more . When Annie came out , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring first-year graduates at astronomical sums . But most of America was getting poorer , not richer . Homelessness on a scale unknown since the Great Depression was about to become the norm for millions . Nonetheless , Annie told us confidently that even the poorest orphan could become a Warbucks heir . American capitalism triumphed once again . <p> In Annie , Christmas functions artistically not simply as the embodiment of moral victory but as a potent symbol for material success . The last scene focuses on munificent gift-giving . There is absolutely nothing spiritual about the day . No one sings Silent Night , let alone Adeste Fideles ; the birth of the savior is the farthest thought from anyone 's mind . Christmas , pure and simple , is nothing but the myth of endless American wealth born of capitalist entrepreneurship . The myth of secular redemption has reached its pinnacle here . <p> Add to Batman and Annie the third piece of evidence : Charles Dickens 's A Christmas Carol . Dickens wrote his masterpiece precisely at the time that Christmas was becoming the cultural focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industrial Revolution , where , once again , the myth of capitalism was wrapped up in the tinsel of Christmas packaging . In reality , the terrors of the time are readily evident from almost every page of every book that Dickens wrote . But not here . The capitalist myth merges with Christmas as secular redemption allows Tiny Tim and his family to be saved from poverty ( not from sin ) and celebrate ( a feast , not a sacrament ) with Christmas plenty donated by none other than Scrooge himself . In his prerepentant days , Scrooge is the very antithesis of the capitalist ideal . He is a rich man like Daddy Warbucks , but he hoards his wealth and despises the poor . Naturally , he disdains-Christmas too . But in the end , he is converted . Christmas is the symbol for good will in general , gift-giving in particular , and the triumph of the capitalist ethic as a general good for one and all . <p> I now understand my own Christmas dilemma . Christmas has been secularized , " capitalized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly as popular culture presents it , it is the myth of the America we all pretend we inhabit : a place where Penguins are foiled , Annies are adopted , and even the poorest among us celebrate the wealth that comes from good old-fashioned hard work and industry . Not to observe Christmas is to blow the whistle on the myth , to expose such naked realities as a trickle-down economy where nothing trickles down , in a country rife with social ills and economic deprivation . <p> The problem is that even in its secularized form , Christmas is not religiously neutral . It is still Christian . So as a Jew , I am in a bind . I am naturally attracted to Christmas as mythic wish-fulfillment , marked by smiling Santas , festive parties , and gifts for everyone . At its secular best , it is at least one day in the year when we remember what we still might be : peaceful people infused with good will toward all , and a generous country , where everyone has a dinner to sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting what is still , for me , a Christian feast with a Christian message . There may be two Christmases here , the age-old religious celebration and the modern secular one . But they are not easily separated . Religious Christians may well be uneasy about the triumph of the secular variety , but at least they do n't have to worry about sliding back and forth between the secular and religious landscapes . They can enjoy the American myth that the secular holiday presents and simultaneously observe the religious event for which Christmas was formulated in the first place . That is a luxury I can not afford . <p> On the other hand , I , along with most other Jews I know , have come to terms with our Christmas dilemma . By no means do I yearn to celebrate Christmas . As the public pomp and ceremony become somewhat overwhelming , I slip into the role of a visitor to a foreign culture . I appreciate , even enjoy , much of the Christmas ambience ; I share my Christian neighbors ' happiness , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The academic part of me wonders how the religious message of Christmas got so overwhelmed by its secular mythology , and the religious part of me feels a little sorry that it happened that way . There are Jews who keep a Passover seder , but with no idea that the event has any religious significance beyond the family 's getting together . There is nothing wrong with family gatherings , but the life of faith is impoverished if the Passover meal is no longer rooted in the religious verities that have animated it through the centuries . I imagine the same must be true of Christmas for Christians . There is nothing wrong with sleigh bells , Bing Crosby , and Christmas pudding , but I should hope Christians would want more than just that , and as Christmas becomes more and more secularized , I am not sure they get it . <p> In the end , the problem of Christmas is not mine any more than Christmas itself is .

@@4017241 Introduction <p> Shrimp fishermen trawling in the Gulf of Mexico and the south Atlantic inadvertently capture and kill sea turtles which are classified as endangered species . Recent Federal legislation requires the use of a Turtle Excluder Device ( TED ) which , when placed in the shrimp trawl , prevents turtle mortality . However , the shrimp industry has been concerned about the possible impact of the TED upon vessel shrimp catch . <p> This analysis was designed to address this issue by evaluating the impact of the TED regulations upon the economic viability of representative shrimp vessels in the Texas shrimp fishery . <p> This analysis , however , does not explicitly consider the interactive aspects of the shrimp fishery , both among the vessels and between the vessel catch and remaining shrimp stock . An implicit assumption of this analysis is that the individual vessel 's fishing behavior would not change as a result of the TED regulations , in response to either increases or decreases in catch per tow . Rather , this analysis is based on the resultant impact on the catch of the representative vessel in the Texas shrimp fishery given all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the vessel catch has changed , what is the impact on the economic viability of the vessel ? Finally , this is an intermediate analysis of the impact of the TED regulations . Future analysis should be directed at examining the interactive effects within the fishery . History <p> In 1981 the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) , as the result of an ongoing research and development program , introduced a shrimping gear design aimed at reducing the capture of sea turtles . This device would be sewn into a shrimp trawl ( Fig. 1 ) and was designed to provide a way for sea turtles to exit the trawl . Because of its proposed function , it was called a Turtle Excluder Device ( TED ) ( Watson et al. , 1985 ) . <p> All sea turtles are listed as endangered or threatened by the Endangered Species Act . Under this Act it is illegal to import , export , take , possess , sell , or transport endangered species without a permit unless these activities are specifically allowed by regulation ( USDC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea turtles are caught in shrimp trawls in the waters of the southeast United States . They are the loggerhead , Caretta caretta ; Kemp 's ridley , Lepidochelys kempi ; green , Chelonia mydas ; leatherback , Dermochelys coriacea ; and hawksbill , Eretmochelys imbricata ( Dean and Steinbach , 1981 ; Anonymous1 ) . In 1978 , when the green and loggerhead sea turtles were listed under the Endangered Species Act ( the other three species were listed in earlier rulemakings ) , the problem of incidental take of these species in the shrimp fishery was addressed in a Final Environmental Impact Statement ( USDC , 1978 ) . At that time , methods to reduce the incidental take were not available . <p> In 1983 , NMFS began a formal program to encourage voluntary adoption of TED 's by the shrimp industry . Through the voluntary program , TED ' s were constructed under contract and distributed to shrimpers who agreed to use them . Modification and evaluation of the TED continued , resulting in a smaller , lighter , collapsible NMFS TED , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity and training activities , the voluntary program was not effective ( Anonymous2 ) . As of late 1986 , less than 3 percent of the shrimp fleet had used or continued to use a TED ( Oravetz3 ) . <p> Specific regulations concerning use of TED 's were developed in 1986 during mediation between members of the southeastern U.S. shrimp industry and interested members of the environmental community . Proposed regulations were published in the March 1987 Federal Register and final regulations were published in the July 1987 Federal Register . As summarized by the National Marine Fisheries Service ( Anonymous 'S ) , as of 1 May 1989 in offshore waters , use of the TED was to be required of all vessels measuring 25 feet or longer . For vessels of less than 25 feet in length , the option of towing 90 minutes was available . There are seasonal requirements by region , with Canaveral and southwest Florida vessels required to pull the TED year-round , Gulf vessels required to pull the TED March though November , and Atlantic vessels from May through August . Inshore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either use a TED or limit tow time to 90 minutes . Turtle Excluder Devices <p> Testing conducted off Cape Canaveral , Fla. , prior to 1988 ( Table 1 ) identified four TED 's which satisfactorily excluded turtles from commercial shrimp nets : 1 ) The standard 30-inch opening and 25-inch opening NMFS TED 's , 2 ) the " Georgia " TED , 3 ) the " Cameron " TED , and4 ) the " Matagorda Bay " TED . In the time period subsequent to 1988 , additional devices have been approved but they are not considered as part of this analysis . <p> The NMFS and Cameron TED 's are three-dimensional , implying that a section of the net must be removed to install the device . The NMFS devices are rectangular in shape whereas the Cameron TED is circular ( Fig. 2 ) . The Georgia and Matagorda TED 's are two-dimensional and are sewn directly into the net . The Georgia TED has a long oval shape with parallel bars creating a barrier across the surface of the device . The Matagorda TED is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier to entry into the cod end of the trawl ( Fig. 3 ) . The positioning of the opening in the trawl , which allows turtles and other large organisms to escape , varies by TED . The NMFS and the Matagorda devices have top openings . The Georgia TED has a bottom opening and the Cameron TED can be used with either a bottom or top opening . <p> Meanwhile , TED development and use has also been proceeding in other nations . In July 1986 , following a publicity and coordination trip in March , a workshop and vessel demonstration was held in Mazatlan , Mex . In Indonesia , over 1,000 TED ' s are in use in the western area on joint-venture Japanese vessels . Indonesia has sent fishing gear experts for training at the NMFS Harvesting Systems Division , Mississippi Laboratories ( USDC , 1985 ) . Tests for Shrimp Exclusion <p> NMFS Tests <p> As early as September 1983 , NMFS was testing its new TED to determine the impact on shrimp catch and by-catch reduction . These tests were directed at evaluating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The TED used in these experiments was the original solid NMFS TED ( Anonymous5 ) . <p> NMFS continued testing and improving the TED , and additional tests were made in 1984 . From July through September , the FRV Jeanie conducted tests off Florida , Alabama , and Mississippi . Initially , tests were directed at performance of several different designs of the NMFS TED . These included : Fiberglass frame and PVC joints , steel-frame collapsible , aluminum frame , and miniature-frame TED . PVC joints of the aluminum-frame TED 's were found to be too weak to withstand normal shrimping operations . <p> Other cruises were made to compare shrimp retention rates of various TED 's vs. a control net without a TED . These cruises were done both day and night and incorporated different types of finfish deflectors ( Hummer wire , types A and H and solid bar , type D ) ( Anonymous6 ) . <p> North Carolina Test <p> The University of North Carolina Sea Grant program was also involved in testing shrimp and fin fish retention rates of the various TED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made aboard the Carolina Coast ( Table 1 ) ( Anonymous7 ) . Of the two NMFS TED 's tested , the one with the 37 degrees grid angle appeared to be more effective at eliminating by-catch with no overall loss of shrimp . Although by-catch was measured in kilograms , shrimp catch was measure in numbers of individual shrimp . Large quantities of shrimp were not encountered , possibly due to the half-hour tow limitation . This made it difficult to measure the impact on shrimp catch . <p> In July 1986 , under the auspices of the University of North Carolina Sea Grant Program , tests were conducted on the " Georgia Jumper " ( Anonymous8 ) . A total of 24 tows were made by the Carolina Coast . Nineteen tows were compared with a standard net and 5 tows were compared with the NMFS TED . Several adjustments were made to the TED before it was operating properly . When all 19 tows were considered , the TED experienced an 18 percent shrimp loss , however , for the 15 tows when the TED was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tested TED was very effective in reducing horseshoe crab , cannonball jellyfish , stingray , and tunicate catches , with an overall by-catch reduction of 24 percent ( 21 percent for the 15 tows above ) . For the 5 tows against the NMFS TED there was an overall 9 percent shrimp loss with 40 percent less by-catch ( Anonymous9 ) . <p> Georgia Test <p> The Marine Extension Service of the Georgia Sea Grant College Program conducted tests off Georgia on the four TED 's tested at the Cape Canaveral channel : Georgia Jumper , Cameron TED , Matagorda TED , and NMFS Collapsible TED without funnel . The purpose of these tests was to determine shrimp exclusion rates of TED 's ( Anonymous 10 ) . <p> A total of 72 double-rig trawls were conducted with 9 port and 9 starboard tows conducted with each of the four different TED 's ( Table 1 ) . Sampling was conducted 3 -- 4 miles east of the south portion of St. Simon 's Island , Ga. , in 30 feet of water . The Georgia Jumper had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TED . The NMFS TED had a 9.9 percent loss , the Cameron TED a 12.4 percent loss , and the Matagorda TED a 26.4 percent loss ( Anonymous11 ) . <p> Texas Test <p> Tests with the four TED 's presently certified for use were conducted in Texas waters using both bay and Gulf vessels to determine the impact of TED devices on Texas shrimp production ( 12 ) . Many of the tows done in Texas were faulty , for one reason or another , and thus , rigorous statistical analyses have not been carried out ( Table 1 ) . The results of this testing were useful in indicating the learning process which must occur when a TED is introduced into the trawl . TED Impacts <p> When reviewing testing that has been completed on various TED 's , a wide range of results is apparent . Tests have been conducted in different areas off the eastern and southern U.S. coasts using different types of vessels and different TED 's . The approach to testing is consistent , i.e. , simultaneous drags with a control net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary across all experiments . As a result , it is not surprising to find that TED capabilities varied with the experiments . <p> Cape Canaveral testing certified four TED 's as possessing the capability of " kicking out " sea turtles from the trawl . Further testing conducted by the NMFS determined finfish reduction capability of the TED and helped in refinement of the TED . Finfish reduction rates as high as 80 percent were recorded during the day although night reduction rates were lower . There was no significant reduction in shrimp catch during these tests ( Anonymous13 ) . <p> Testing by the University of North Carolina Sea Grant program resulted in extreme values for average shrimp loss ( 58 percent ) over all tests . The TED was mounted in the net at a 45 degrees angle ; subsequent North Carolina testing showed this to be an inappropriate angle . In addition , the results were for experiments where the total number of shrimp encountered were small , and this makes any analysis suspect . Further testing with a 37 degrees angle for TED installation gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were consistently encountered during these experiments . <p> Tests off St. Simon 's Island , Ga. , were the only ones to use all four certified TED 's . The Georgia Jumper had a 1.9 percent production gain , whereas the other three TED 's showed losses ( NMFS a 9.9 percent loss , Cameron a 12.4 percent loss , and Matagorda a 26.4 percent loss ) . However , only 18 tows were made with each TED . <p> The final series of tests , off the Texas coast , are reported here . Again , the variety of vessels used and variation in equipment , as well as change in location , made accurate interpretation of this data difficult . In addition , a report by Byrne , et . al . 14 argues that the experimental design of the TED testing does not allow specific shrimp retention rates to be identified . Economic Impact of TED 's Method of Analysis <p> The intent of this analysis was to examine the impact of TED regulations on the earning capacity of a single representative vessel . The method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel in the Texas ' Gulf shrimp fishery , using the firm-level simulation model FLEETSIM , under the proposed TED regulations ( Clark et al15 ) . FLEETSIM is a firm level , recursive , simulation model which simulates the annual production , costs , and income aspects of a fleet , by vessel , over a multi-year planning horizon . <p> FLEETSIM is capable of simulating a hypothetical fleet for 1-10 years . The model recursively simulates a typical fleet by using the ending financial position for year one as the beginning position for the second year , and so on . FLEETSIM does not include an overall objective function to be optimize , but rather analyzes the outcome of a given set of input data and assumptions for a typical fleet . Accounting equations and identities constitute most of the computational components of the model . <p> Procedure <p> Three separate simulations were conducted in an effort to analyze the impact of the TED regulations . These three models were : 1 ) Historical , 2 ) Baseline , and 3 ) TED Simulations . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 to 1986 . No analysis is included for bay vessels on the assumption.that bay shrimpers will take advantage of the 90-minute tow time exception and will not be required to use TED 's . This analysis was deterministic and was conducted to obtain a starting financial position for the baseline simulation . The program was run using actual values for changes in inflation , interest rates , landings and prices , and production costs for a representative vessel . In addition , the model began with a new vessel in 1978 and was run without considering income tax . Therefore , all values generated represent a before-tax situation . <p> The second FLEETSIM analysis involved the development of a baseline simulation model for the fishery . The first year of analysis for this model was 1987 . The purpose of the baseline model was to predict what would occur in the industry without TED regulations . The result of the baseline simulations was later used to determine the impact of the TED regulations . The third step , following the development of the baseline simulation model and estimates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build effects of TED regulations into the model . <p> Data <p> Production and budget information for Gulfshrimpers was obtained from interviews conducted with members of the Texas Gulf shrimp industry ( Anonymous16 ) . This information included past production , costs and returns , and changes in number and size of vessels for the period 1969-86 . Vessel size and construction varied considerably from 20- to 30-foot wood up ' to 90-foot steel ones . Some firms had vessels that were 20-30 years old , while others culled vessels after 10 years . <p> Baseline and-TED simulation analyses were stochastic , as opposed to deterministic . In Baseline and TED policy analyses , pounds landed by the vessel were stochastically set about a mean value , based on a 5 year ( 1982-86 ) average of fishery landings . Prices were similarly set but included an adjustment based on changes in the Consumer Price Index . No attempt was made to account for any price changes which might occur if the use of a TED leads to a decline in total production of shrimp , Gulfwide . Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimp which are the mainstay of the Gulf shrimp fleet analyzed here . <p> In an effort to make stochastic variables a function of actual relationships in the industry , an analysis of historical price and landing trends for Gulf shrimp vessels was conducted . To generate random landings and prices , it was necessary to provide cumulative deviations around mean values for these variables . This was accomplished by regressing average annual landings and prices against time and taking resulting deviations and dividing them by the value for mean landings and prices . An additional explanation of this procedure can be found in the FLEETSIM user manual . <p> Values for future interest rates and inflations rates , associated with prices and production costs , were obtained from COMGEM17 , a macroeconomic simulation model developed by Penson , Hughes , and Romain . The " best " predictions available were annual predictions of inflation rates approximating 4 percent for 1987 through 1990 and , thereafter a constant of 4 percent . The cumulative deviations of these macroexogenous variables , i.e. , interest rates and fuel prices . were generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those for landings and prices . <p> Assumptions <p> The impact of the TED on the production capability of the vessel is potentially manyfold . It is expected that initially there will be a negative impact while the fisherman learns how to use the device . This " learning period " will vary by vessel and captain and , therefore , a measurement of its impact is difficult . <p> Contributing to this measurement problem is the range of difficulty of use across various TED devices . The Georgia Jumper and Matagorda TED 's are relatively simple devices , whereas the NMFS and Cameron TED 's are bulky and more difficult to work with . Many vessel captains already employ some type of excluder device ( " jellyball shooters " ) during certain portions of the year . This experience should make efficient use of a TED more likely . In this analysis , because of the inability to establish a reasonable estimate of the " learning period " impact of adopting a TED , no impact is included . <p> Another point is the widespread perception that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle and may have an effect on insurance rates . Conversely , there may be positive benefits associated with the use of a TED . Improved fishing efficiency and fewer safety problems which arise from heavy by-catch , may result in favorable changes in insurance rates . No analysis is incorporated in this study because of an inability to establish a specific impact of the TED on insurance rates . <p> For similar reasons , issues dealing with possible improved shrimping efficiency associated with use of the TED are not dealt with in this analysis . This improved efficiency centers around possible higher percentage of shrimp in the catch when a TED is used , resulting in longer tow times , improved shrimp quality , and reduced sorting time . <p> A final issue is that research to date has been limited to tow-by-tow comparisons for one vessel and do not represent the situation when all vessels will pull a TED . For example , if an area of ocean bottom contains , at any one time , a fixed amount of shrimp , several passes through the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each net is catching less shrimp on the first pass ( because of the TED ) , subsequent passes will be associated with larger remaining population level because less shrimp were taken on the previous tow . Thus , although catch per unit of effort might be reduced for a given tow because of the TED , the catch p of effort would not decrease as much as suggested by the sample data because more population remains for the next tow . The argument is perhaps best seen in reverse . Some of the research indicates that the use of a TED increases shrimp catch , yet it is not sensible to believe that the total shrimp catch Gulf-wide could increase annually by 5 percent if TED 's are employed . The impact of TED 's on the industry can not be extrapolated from an isolated vessel pulling a TED , which has been the research to date . <p> The studies that have been conducted to date do not focus on the above issues and , therefore , data are limited . Although these issues are recognized as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was assumed that the vessel was purchased new at the beginning of the historical simulation ( 1978 ) . The vessel was of steel construction and 73 feet in length . In purchasing the vessel , it was assumed that 50 percent of the purchase price was paid down and the rest of the purchase price was financed over a 10 year period at 9 percent per annum . <p> To examine the impact of the TED regulations , assumptions had to be made about the impact of the TED on production capabilities of the vessels and cost of various TED devices . These assumptions were based on production impact analysis presented earlier as well as cost information obtained for the four TED devices . <p> Considerable differences exist in the studies that have been conducted about the impact of the TED on shrimp production . It is assumed that shrimpers will use those TED 's that are most effective at retaining shrimp . The mean shrimp retention . however . has generally ranged from a small increase to about a 10 percent decrease when using a TED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered and technical difficulties are absent . ' Therefore , four scenarios are reported in this research ; No change , a 5 percent decrease a 10 percent decrease , and a 5 percent increase in shrimp production associated with the use of a TED . This range encompasses the mean retention of the most efficient TED 's . <p> TED Costs <p> At the time of this study there were five certified TED 's : the NMFS , Georgia Jumper , Cameron , Matagorda , and a " soft " TED . This paper was essentially complete before the soft TED was certified , and therefore , no economic analysis of this particular device is included . Highest estimates of acquisition costs were for the NMFS TED , with quotes between $375 and $475 , whereas price estimates for the Georgia and the Cameron TED 's ranged between $150 and $250 ( Clark and Griffin18 ) . For purposes of this analysis , each TED is assumed to cost $300 ( a number between the lesser cost TED 's and the NMFS TED ) . <p> Total cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of TED . In the Gulf it is possible to see both double-trawl and twin-trawl rigs , indicating between three and six TED 's could be required for a Gulf vessel . These numbers include a spare TED for each two TED 's used . The expected life of the TED is assumed to be 2 years . <p> The model was run for a double-trawl rig which required an investment in three TED 's at a cost of $300 per TED . This resulted in a total purchase cost for the Gulf vessel of $900 or an annual cost of $450 . <p> An additional annual maintenance cost of $50 was assumed , resulting in an annual TED cost of $500 . An accounting technique , which entered the TED cost on the cost side of the model and reduced initial cash by one-half the purchase price of the TED , forced the model to put cash aside for the purchase of a TED 2 years in the future . <p> Method of Evaluation <p> Variables used in evaluating the impact of TED regulations on the representative vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of return of the analysis , present value of ending net worth , equity-to-asset ratio and the probability net present value will be greater than zero . Net worth was determined by subtracting total liabilities from total assets . Ending net worth reflected owner 's equity in the vessel and in other personal property at the end of the planning horizon . The internal rate of return is often referred to as " marginal efficiency of capital . " By definition , internal rate of return is the discount rate that equates present value of benefits with the present value of costs . An investment is selected as long as internal rate of return exceeds cost of capital . <p> The present value technique puts the net worth at the end of the planning horizon in real dollars . The equity-to-asset ratio is one measure of solvency . A one-to-one ratio means a vessel/boat owner did not have any debt . A ratio less than one-to-one would indicate a business had not paid off all debt owed on assets ( Osburn and Schneeberger , 1978 ) . <p> Another issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that net present value of a stream of income during the period of analysis was greater than zero . The discount rate used for calculating net present value was set at 7 percent . It was not unreasonable to expect this rate of return on alternative investments outside the fleet . These five variables are obtained from stochastic simulations for the baseline and four TED scenarios . Discussion of Simulation Results <p> Deterministic Simulation 1978-1986 <p> A representative Gulf vessel was simulated for 9 years . An outstanding balance on the vessel of $120,000 was financed during 10 years at a rate of 9 percent per annum . Beginning cash reserve was set at $26,000 and resulting beginning net worth ( market value ) was $117,692 . These starting values are required by the model , but will not affect the comparative analysis of using a TED . <p> Annual values for those costs which varied with level of production are presented in Table 2 . In addition to these costs , dock space was set at an annual rental of $663 . Fixed costs , those which a re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary during the period under consideration , included only vessel insurance at $7,738 . Other costs , such as depreciation and interest , were calculated by FLEETSIM . <p> By simulating the model for the nine year period , 1978-86 , the ending financial position for the vessel was obtained . The vessel ends the 9 years with $122,469 in cash on hand and vessel assets worth $211,692 , giving total asset value of $334,161 . The only liability associated with the vessel was an intermediate-term debt of $17,155 . Net present value for 9 years was $54,739 . Internal rate of return was 8 percent . <p> Baseline Simulation <p> The baseline simulation was set up to simulate what would occur to the Gulf vessel during 1987-97 . This was accomplished without considering the impact of TED regulations and results were later used to compare against those analyses where the TED policy was simulated . The baseline simulation was run for 50 different iterations which allowed average values to be generated for the statistics of interest . <p> The vessel , purchased in 1978 had a market value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Average ending net worth in year 10 for base-line simulation was $898,801 ( Table 3 ) . Although the value for average internal rate of return is low ( 3.72 percent ) , the use of a representative vessel in the simulation model contributed to this low value . The practice by many Gulf shrimpers of spreading the cost of running a vessel across many different operations , allows the vessel to be run less efficiently and still remain solvent ; hence , a low internal rate of return for the vessel . Many vessel operators , however , are very efficient and generated much higher rates of return . <p> Average present value of ending net worth was $455,888 and average equity to asset ratio was 0.945 , indicating the operator had a low debt level . The baseline simulation model had a 78 percent chance of generating a net present value greater than zero ( with a discount rate of 7 percent ) . <p> Simulation with TED <p> Four different simulations were run to examine impacts of TED regulations on a typical Gulf vessel . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics of interest to be generated . These different scenarios were run assuming no impact on shrimp catch ( Scenario 1 ) , a 5 percent decrease in catch ( Scenario 2 ) , a 10 percent decrease in catch ( Scenario 3 ) , and finally a 5 percent increase in catch ( Scenario 4 ) . These results were as expected in that all economic indicators declined for negative impacts on shrimp production and increased for the positive impact on shrimp production ( Table 3 ) . <p> The next step in the analysis of the simulation results was to determine if the decrease or increase in the economic indicators was a significant change from the baseline simulation . This was accomplished by a statistical comparison of the means . The hypothesis tested was <p> Multiple line equation(s) can not be represented in ASCII text . <p> with an alternative hypothesis of <p> Multiple line equation(s) can not be represented in ASCII text . <p> The test statistic used <p> Multiple line equation(s) can not be represented in ASCII text . <p> which is an approximation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes are sufficiently large ( DeGroot , 1975 ) . The sample sizes , n1 and n2 , are equal to 50 . This test statistic allows determination of significant differences from the baseline results but does not allow any comparisons to be made across all simulations . Since the primary purpose of this analysis was to determine if use of the TED resulted in a change in the economic well-being of the vessel , it was felt this test statistic would be sufficient . <p> The computed z-values for the various economic indicators are presented in Table 4 . Each row examines the computed z-value for a TED scenario against the baseline scenario . Those test statistics which were significant at the 95 percent level are marked as footnote 2 . It is apparent that all of the TED Scenarios where there is a change in the level of catch will cause a significant change in both Ending Net Worth in Year 10 as well as Present Value of Ending Net Worth . This is important because it indicates that even the discounted Net Worth is significantly different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not significantly different from the baseline until Scenario 3 . In Scenario 2 , where the impact on the shrimp catch is a loss of 5 percent , the calculated z-value is significant at the 80 percent level . There is no significant difference in the values for the Equity/Asset ratio between the baseline and any of the TED scenarios . <p> What this suggests is that the impact of the TED is significant if the vessel owner is primarily interested in vessel earnings . However , if alternative enterprises are to be considered then there is no appreciable difference in the rate of return associated with the decision to operate a shrimp boat or an alternative enterprise until the impact upon the shrimp catch is very large . It is also notable that the impact upon shrimp catch and therefore earnings , does not result in significant increases in debt levels in the TED scenarios . Because of the way the FLEETSIM model generates Probability of Net Present Value greater than Zero , it was not possible to use the above test to determine significant differences from the Baseline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis is an intermediate analysis of the impact of the TED regulations . It does not explicitly consider the interactive aspects of the shrimp fishery both among vessels and between vessel catch and the remaining shrimp stock . This analysis is based on the resultant impact on the catch of a representative vessel in the Texas shrimp fishery given all inter ) active effects . <p> Four scenarios were analyzed for the effect of the TED on shrimp production . These were , no change , a 5 percent decrease , a 10 percent decrease and a 5 percent increase . The results were as expected in that all economic indicators declined for negative impacts on shrimp production and increased for the positive impact on shrimp production . A statistical analysis of the economic indicators pointed out that in Scenario 2 and 4 , both of which represented a 5 percent impact upon shrimp catch , Ending Net Worth and Present Value of Ending Net Worth were significantly different from the baseline at a 5 percent level . Only in Scenario 3 ( 10 percent decline in catch ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Present Value of Ending Net Worth all significantly different from the Baseline Scenario at a 5 percent level . Research to date , however , indicates that there are TED 's , specifically the Georgia TED , which have experimental results consistently better than a 10 percent shrimp loss . In fact , the Georgia TED ( or Georgia Jumper ) has increased shrimp retention in all experiments reported here . If there is no effect upon shrimp landings as a result of pulling the TED , the only economic effect will be the cost of purchasing and maintaining the TED . These costs will have only a very minor impact on the shrimp industry . <p> It is important to note that no research has been undertaken on other impacts a TED may have on shrimping operations . For example , in addition to the impact which by-catch reduction may have on shrimp catch , the TED may also impact quality , onboard safety , and onboard handling of gear and shrimp fleet catches when all vessels are pulling a TED . None of these potentially significant impacts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conclusive statements could be made about the impact of the TED upon shrimp retention using the existing data . A first step in the analysis of the impact of TED regulations on the shrimp industry should be to analyze the combined effects of shrimp gain or loss by an individual vessel with biomass changes when all vessels in the industry use a TED and the individual vessel impacts from reduced by-catch . These combined effects entail looking at the impacts , in the limit , of shrimp gain or loss when tows are successively applied to a fixed biomass of shrimp over time . If the combined effect leads to shrimp loss to all vessels , then further statistically valid side-by-side tests of a TED or TED 's on shrimp retention need to be done . The other issues of shrimp quality , safety and deck handling procedures could possibly be included in these further tests . However , if there is no significant shrimp loss to all vessels when considering the above combined effects , then further expensive side-by-side retention tests of TED 's is not warranted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Marine Fisheries Service , financial assistance award # NA86WC-8-06129 ( MARFIN ) . <p> ( <p> 
@@4020041 SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE <p> Health care facilities can be hazardous to your health ! The safety of hospital patients ( or rather the lack thereof ) has been well studied . In 2000 The Institute of Medicine report , " To Err is Human , " stated that the annual number of patient deaths due to medical errors could be as high as 98,000 , most of which could have been prevented ( Kohn et al ) . <p> Patients are not the only ones subject to health and safety risks . Health care providers have four times the risk of incurring musculoskeletal injuries ( MSIs ) compared to workers in other industries ( Charney and Hudson , 2004 ) . Injury rates to nurses and other caregivers run as high as 83 injuries per 200,000 work hours ( Garg and Owen , 1992 ) . Injured nurses suffer emotionally , socially and financially ( Charney and Hudson , 2004 ) . The costs resulting from MSIs in the Unites States are estimated at $13.2 billion ( Liberty Mutual , 2004 ) . WHAT IS A SAFE ENVIRONMENT ? <p> Safety has become a buzz word in health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles discussing this topic in one way or another . It is hard to find a hospital , long-term care facility , or clinic without multiple safety initiatives . Safety projects with creative names such as " Safest in America , " " Pause for the Cause , " and " 100,000 Lives " are just the tip of the iceberg . Safety has also become a key criterion for accrediting bodies such as the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations ( JCAHO ) , regulating bodies such as health departments , and third party payers such as insurance companies and Medicare . <p> Unions representing nurses have taken a strong stand in support of initiatives to decrease injuries , particularly back injuries , by incorporating safety measures into their contracts . Contract language can include initiatives such as requiring hospitals to install lifting equipment or implementing educational programs for staff safety . <p> Historically , an unsafe environment was seen as caused primarily by human error . In this view , errors were explained as failures in the actions performed by caregivers ( Dekker , 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caregiver whose performance violated a certain guideline , policy , or standard . For instance , medication errors were considered the result of a nurse not following the " 5 Rights . " The belief was that these errors could be controlled or eliminated by blaming the caregiver for not following the guidelines , policies or standards . Punitive action was frequently a logical result ( Marx , 2001 ) . This approach has been shown to be ineffective because it leads to underreporting and hiding of errors for fear of retaliation ( Dekker , 2002 ; Krause , 2006 ) . <p> Sidney Dekker ( 2002 ) presents a more contemporary view of what factors create a safe environment . Key components include the principle that error is a symptom of deeper system problems , not necessarily the result of an individual 's erroneous actions . Safe care can only be delivered in an environment in which safety is the goal of all , and errors and injuries can be discussed without fear of negative consequences . This environment is a climate free of blame in which all people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety -- in which the focus is on creating safety . It is also an environment in which patients , caregivers and administrators function with a common understanding of what safety is , and lessons learned from near misses , good catches , errors and injuries are hardwired into the system ( Dekker , 2002 ; Krause , 2006 ; Marx , 2001 ; Reason , 2000 ; Reason , 1990 ) . <p> With all the work being done in the areas of patient safety and caregiver safety , we might assume that these two sets of initiatives are closely intertwined . Unfortunately , this is frequently not the case . Caregiver and patient safety initiatives use different paradigms and are based on different assumptions . PATIENT SAFETY <p> In most health safety initiatives , the patient is the main focus . Objectives include decreasing patient falls , bedsores , medication errors and other negative outcomes . Approaches to addressing these types of problems are based on an environment which is free of blame and in which reporting of errors is transparent . Most health care institutions have abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-depth analysis follows incidents of error or patient injury . No stone is left unturned as all factors that contributed to the error are analyzed by a multidisciplinary team including caregivers , managers , administrators , and other key players . <p> Once the analysis is complete , a plan to prevent similar injuries/errors is created and implemented . Information that can lead to injury prevention is shared with other areas and , in some cases , other institutions in an effort to prevent similar injuries in the future . To promote this process , health care institutions are protected by peer review guidelines , meaning that information discovered during the analysis of errors can not be subpoenaed or used against the organization in a court of law ( Marchev , 2003 ) . CAREGIVER SAFETY <p> Nurses and other caregivers are vulnerable to injuries at work . MSIs have historically been considered a risk inherent in nursing work , caused by poor body mechanics ( 0wen , 2000a , 2000b ) . <p> The typical approach to addressing staff injuries is markedly different than for patients injured through errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager and their employer 's occupational health department . The injured nurse is treated for the injury and , if possible , returns to Work after having recovered . An in-depth analysis such as occurs when a patient has been injured is uncommon or nonexistent when the injured person is a caregiver . <p> Addressing injuries in caregivers commonly uses traditional occupational health models based on the premise that employee injuries occur because of exposure to risk factors . According to this premise , nurses can avoid injury by not exposing themselves to those risk factors ; thus , when nurses stop performing certain high-risk tasks , injuries will stop occurring ( DiBenedetto , 1995 ) . This model has been very effective in decreasing injuries in industrial settings . In the early 1900s , Alice Hamilton documented the strong correlation between the presence of lead in the workplace and occupational illness and even death . The elimination of lead was a dramatic improvement for workers ( Hamilton , 1911 ) . Unfortunately , many employers were reluctant to make changes until legislation and enforcement were introduced ( MacLaury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so successful , this occupational health model continues to be used today . <p> When attempting to solve the problem of MSIs in nursing , the occupational health model is the primary model implemented . Based on the assumption that eliminating risks will decrease injuries , a seven-point strategy can be identified in the literature : <p> -- Manual handling of patients should be avoided except for life-threatening situations ( State of Texas , 2005 ) . <p> -- Proper lifting equipment should be available and used when patients are handled ( Nelson , 2006 ) . <p> -- Nurses should be educated on the use of lifting equipment ( Nelson , 2006 ) . <p> -- Transfer techniques should be standardized and focused on the elimination of manual handling ( Patient Safety Center of Inquiry ( Tampa , FL ) , Veterans Health Administration and Department of Defense , 2001 ) . <p> -- Punitive policies should be implemented that hold nurses/caregivers accountable for using equipment ( Charney and Hudson , 2004 ; Garg , 2006 ) . <p> -- Legislation requiring the implementation of safe patient handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson , 2004 ) . <p> -- Incentive programs should be implemented for leadership that demonstrates a decrease in the number of injuries ( Wu , 2006 ) . <p> The financial benefits of decreasing the number of reported injuries have been shown to outweigh the cost of training and equipment ( Charney and Hudson , 2004 ; Chhokar et al. , 2005 ; Nelson , 2006 ) . Currently , the actual number of injuries can be measured only by tracking the number of reported injuries . THE PARADOX <p> Even though safety in health care institutions is being addressed , patient and staff safety are addressed using different paradigms . Errors and injuries including patients are being used as learning opportunities and as a means to understanding factors that can improve safety . Patient safety officials focus on the individual case while establishing procedures and guidelines that might benefit other patients . When a similar patient error/injury recurs , the health care team goes back to the drawing board to adjust the system . <p> The approach for care provider injuries , in contrast , is very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known -- namely , an individual nurse not acting correctly . Thus , individual analysis is unnecessary ; implementation of policies and corrective actions are the logical next step . Yet blame and punishment have been shown to decrease or even totally stop reporting . Offering managers financial incentives to decrease the number of injury reports promotes underreporting . Reporting an injury to one 's superior who is financially affected by that report could easily become an unpleasant experience . Research on decreasing MSIs has shown that the largest decreases in injury reporting occurred when the use of equipment was legally mandated . <p> The current rule-based approach to workplace safety for nurses can lead to several problems : INTENT VERSUS RESULT <p> The intent of the implemented safety measures is undoubtedly to decrease staff injuries , which would benefit both the institution and individual nurses . But the results of those measures should be monitored closely . The following areas are especially prone to unintended and/or undesirable results : <p> -- Implementing punitive policies with the intent to encourage nurses to protect their own safety could result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be injured , but also would lose compensation for their injuries . <p> -- The intent of giving managers financial incentives to decrease reported injuries is to foster highly involved leadership , but the effect could be an environment in which reporting injuries becomes difficult . <p> -- Creating policies on lifting with the intent to create a safe environment could promote the message that nurses do not or should not have the ability to make choices that are best for themselves . <p> -- Providing lifting equipment has the intent of creating a safer environment , but numerous patients are injured or killed every year in mishaps related to the use of lifting equipment . <p> The relationship between patients and nurses is very complex , involving individual needs , communication , power dynamics , expectations , and other factors . Algorithms and standards can be helpful in determining the best care , but these must not eliminate the nurse 's ability to make knowledge-based decisions . The implementation of algorithms and policies from which nurses are not allowed to deviate except in life-threatening situations leads to nurses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations and personalities are not taken into consideration . Enforcing algorithms makes nurses ' work " invisible " by neglecting the value of nurses ' knowledge of the patient and his or her care . The patient is made " invisible " by ignoring specific problems such as pain , anxiety , and previous experiences . ETHICAL/MORAL ISSUES <p> The current approach to preventing injuries to nurses also raises ethical issues , including : <p> -- Is it acceptable for patients to be exposed to increased pain , discomfort , and/or risk injury in order to protect nurses ? <p> -- Should nurses have to expose themselves to the risk of injury as part of delivering patient care ? <p> -- If a policy is in conflict with a nurse 's professional judgment what should the nurse do ? <p> The dilemmas described above can lead to a " grey zone " in which whatever action the nurse chooses could have negative moral consequences . For instance , deciding not to use lifting equipment when transferring a highly anxious patient in order to minimize the negative impact on that patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lead to termination . On the other hand , if the nurse does use lifting equipment but perceives that he or she is inflicting avoidable discomfort or even terror on a patient , this action could lead to moral distress . Knowingly placing people in the " grey zone " is wrong - It strips people of their personal integrity ( Card , 2002 ) . SOLVING THE PARADOX <p> One solution to the paradoxical approaches to safety would be to adopt the same models for staff safety and patient safety . Nursing safety initiatives appear to focus on trying to create order out of chaos - that is , trying to gain control of a complex , multi-faceted situation . However , thinking that we can gain control over nursing staff injuries may be oversimplifying the complexity of what it means to offer care . A more fruitful approach is recognizing all the factors involved in transferring patients . This would be a model in which each injury is analyzed in a non-punitive manner , and events are used as lessons learned . Nurses ' and patients ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outweigh the other . Frameworks such as Margaret Urban Walker 's expressive-collaborative model of creating moral understanding in interpersonal dynamics and power structures can help nurses understand their own safety needs as well as those of their patients . Each person 's integrity would be taken into consideration and respected . Interventions would take interpersonal relationships , power dynamics , and contextual factors into account . <p> Whatever safety model is adopted should focus on helping nurses understand how to judge unsafe situations in real time , maintaining the emotional , social , and physical integrity of both patient and nurse and simultaneously allowing nurses to maintain their professional autonomy . SUMMARY <p> Creating an environment that is truly safe for both nurses and patients requires the elimination of disparities in approaches to staff safety and patient safety . Patient safety approaches based on transparency and blamelessness are effective tools in developing an environment that is constantly improving itself . <p> In addition to creating a safe and blame-free environment , creating a new model that nurses can use in real time would allow for rapid decision-making that maintains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@4070941 Standards organizations historically use a consensus approach to develop new technologies . But in the modernization of a key pressure vessel code , the objective of consensus-building took on an expanded scope . <p> The newest version of one of ASME 's pressure vessel codes , known as Section VIII , Division 2 , has been updated not only in its content , but also in the organization and presentation of the information it contains . What 's more , the method by which the new edition was developed differed in many ways from earlier practice . The new VIII-2 , which becomes mandatory on July 1 , may serve as a model for future standards development . <p> Before the project to rewrite the Section VIII , Division 2 pressure vessel code began , an ASME committee of industry veterans surveyed potential users in the petrochemical and manufacturing industries to build consensus on what these target users wanted . " Make the code more user-friendly " was one of the top requests . <p> In a business environment where modern technology serves up an abundance of information on illuminated screens , industry experts increasingly believe that userfriendly presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their active use . The survey results confirmed that not only do users demand the latest technology innovation , but also a structure that makes the standard easy to use and understand . <p> " We had no choice if we were to develop a worldclass pressure vessel design code that would exceed our customers ' needs , " said Louis Hayden , ASME 's vice president of Pressure Technology Codes and Standards , who served as project manager for the rewrite . " To be blunt , the standard was difficult to use , particularly for early-career engineers . We needed to start from scratch after reviewing pressure vessel codes from around the world . " <p> The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code was first published in 1915 , and the initial edition of the Unfired Pressure Vessel Code , Division 1 , was distributed in 1925 . As far back as the 1960s , it was recognized that the special requirements for design of pressure vessels operating at pressures over 2,000 psi ( 13.7 MPa ) called for special rules , and ASME issued Section VIII , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These codes have been actively maintained and updated by a dedicated group of volunteers , but it was becoming difficult to work within the older format . The increased understanding of failure mechanisms and advances in material science , nondestructive testing , and computeraided design have progressed to the stage where a new approach was needed not only in the content of design codes , but in the way they are presented and organized . <p> By doing a clean-sheet rewrite , the standard has been modernized not only with the latest technical advances in pressure vessel construction , but also in a structure that is friendly for both users and the committees that maintain it . <p> L : International Pressure International codes and corporate engineering practices had demonstrated with over 30 years of operating experience that a lower design margin , along with advanced engineering practices , resulted in safe pressure vessel construction . With a design margin of 3.0 , the old Section VIII , Division 2 was not commercially competitive with European standards . In the new edition of VIII-2 , the design margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old VIII-2 required a lot of extra and unnecessary analysis , and was not very cost effective . <p> According to Tom Pastor , Hartford Steam Boiler vice president and chair of the ASME Subcommittee on Pressure Vessels that authorized the rewrite , " Senior volunteers felt it was time to turn our attention to VIII-2 . VIII-2 was not a heavily used standard , and thus it was not kept up to date at the same pace as VIII-1 . " <p> Traditionally , the development of new standards by ASME is carried out by volunteer committees . The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee consists of a volunteer manpower base of about 800 engineers . But experience with previous new code or rewrite activities demonstrated that the volunteer manpower base did not have enough industry-sponsored time to finish the project quickly and efficiently . The last major standard developed completely by volunteers was Section VIII , Division 3 , for vessels operating at pressures above 10,000 psi , which took nearly 15 years to complete . <p> The Section VIII , Division 2 code applies to vessels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Accomplishing this using only the volunteer manpower base would have detracted significantly from the quality of the new code and added significantly to the required development costs and time by a factor of two or more , " said Guido Karcher , who chaired the Board on Pressure Technology Codes and Standards from 2005 to 2008 , the ASME board responsible for the rewrite process . " Even with such a resource , it would have been necessary to provide an overall project management activity to coordinate volunteer reviews and consistency between the reviewing efforts . " <p> With the development of a European pressure code , waiting 15 or more years for a needed update to Section VIII , Division 2 was not an option , so ASME decided to use an outside organization to develop the first draft of the new standard . The project was awarded to the Pressure Vessel Research Council ( PVRC ) , which in turn formed the Task Group on Continued Modernization of Codes to oversee development . PVRC then engaged the Equity Engineering Group as the lead investigator , editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Japan Steel Works ' Web site shows the plan of construction for a pressure vessel built at its Muroran Plant . <p> A steering committee made up of ASME Section VIII members was formed to provide technical oversight and direction to the development team , with the goal of facilitating the eventual balloting and approval process . ASME also hired a project manager to coordinate the activities required to bring the new standard to publication . <p> Numerous international groups have written standards covering pressure equipment . The most important are the European Committee for Standardization , or CEN , which has 30 national members , and the International Standards Organization , a non-government organization that builds consensus through a network of national standards from more than 150 countries . The developers of the new Division 2 code believe it enables ASME to maintain a pre-eminent position in pressure vessel technology globally , because it advances design practices beyond standing CEN and ISO codes . <p> " The new Division 2 provides for many of the longstanding accreditation and design practices that are not in the CEN or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides for a more efficient and adaptable code for international use via the new recognitions of engineering certifications outside of the U.S.A. and Canada . " <p> L : Feedback Before Publication The rewrite of Section VIII , Division 2 broke new ground for ASME in several areas , from hiring a project manager to publishing the document in single columns and formatting it to satisfy ISO guidelines . Also , the project team initiated two other activities to ensure both high quality and acceptance of the Division 2 rewrite : a validation of all design rules , and beta testing of the document . <p> The new Division 2 contains hundreds of equations and polynomial expressions for curve fits used in the design rules . Even where rules were taken from Section VIII , Division 1 , they were rewritten in most cases to facilitate computerization . The net result was that to check each equation , figure , and polynomial expression would have been a major undertaking . If volunteers were asked to perform this work , it would have delayed publication of the document . <p> Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software was contracted to assure the quality of the design rules . It performed this work by programming all the design rules in Mathcad and running numerous examples . Whenever possible , examples from the old VIII-2 and VIII-1 were used for the validation work . In all , over a thousand pages of calculations were performed and the process did identify some errors , mostly in the equations used to model design curves . This validation work will serve as the starting point for an examples manual to be developed for future publication . <p> Everyone on the Division 2 project team was interested in receiving feedback from users , and normally this feedback is received once a standard is published and used for production vessels . This time , however , it was decided to test the standard prior to publication , during the last stages of approval . Invitations to participate were sent to several Division 2 certificate holders , who were asked to select a recently completed Division 2 vessel and re-execute the project on paper using the new standard . A large number of interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel to be used in the evaluation . <p> The beta test provided validation of many of the goals set forth when the project was initiated . As expected , significant cost savings were reported due to the increase in allowable stress for many carbon and low-alloy steels . Of equal importance , most of the testers also reported a reduced amount of reinforcement required for openings resulting in a reduction in forged nozzle thickness . <p> All the beta testers reported the standard was easy to use and that the design rules were clear and concise . Many said they prefer the new format of the document . <p> Early in the project , developers surveyed code users , including vessel users , manufacturers , and regulatory organizations . According to Karcher , " These responses were used as building blocks in the new Division 2 . Some resulting examples are the use of non-North American professional engineers , a more comprehensive and better focused user design specification , single column ISO numbering and format . " <p> After publication , surveys were conducted to assess the new code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , and the U.S. According to Hayden , " Attendees were surveyed as to their likes and dislikes of the new code . Their input has been factored into addenda and plans for continued publication of this code in its current format . " <p> L : Extended Transition Originally published in 2007 , the new Section VIII , Division 2 was to become mandatory Jan. 1 , 2008 . A code case was approved ( Code Case 2575 ) that allows for an 18-month transition period during which VIII-2 certificate holders will be able to construct to either the old VIII-2 ( 2004 edition through 2006 addenda ) or the new VIII-2 . The transition period ends July 1 this year , when the new edition will become the only one in effect . <p> ASME is offering training seminars for the new code at locations around the world . As user communities are identified , ASME has also set up international interest groups that can nominate engineers for delegate membership in the ASME code committees of interest .

@@4011841 The Uruguayan coup of 1973 , like those of other countries in the Southern Cone , signified not only the interruption of the constitutional , liberal-democratic state , but also the total dislocation of national cultural life. 1 In previous decades , the humanist , Europeanized and anachronic official culture languished , confined to its role as referee ( in the final analysis , financial referee ) between the state 's ideological apparatus and other culture-disseminating institutions. 2 The autonomy of the State 's cultural policy had been reduced to the worn-out repetition of pompous rites established in other , prosperous times , so the State exercised its hegemony in collusion with and subordinate to the increasingly ( directly or indirectly ) foreign-controlled private mass media. 3 This connivance intensified the process of acculturation , understood -- in the well-established Latin American sense of the term , which rejects the very vague definition by Robert Redfield , Ralph Linton and Melville Herskovits -- 4as a compulsory cultural penetration , through the use of a more advanced technology , which imposes foreign models , erases heterogeneity , and deprives the subaltern culture of its distinctive traits. 5 <p> The intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian sense of the word , and not in Mannheim 's -- ' an authentic intelligentsia , which pervaded and regulated instruments such as the university , the theater , plastic arts and publishing companies. 7 This intelligentsia , in alliance with popular sectors and making use of the ruptures of the State , promoted very dynamic cultural manifestations which rivaled and entered into open conflict with fossilized official culture and the pervading mass media . This determined a highly explosive dual contradiction : 1 ) between the theoretically omnipotent political apparatus and its ( in- ) capacity to hegemonize culture ; and 2 ) between an officially blessed acculturizing mass culture and a politically driven popular culture rooted in folkloric traditions , intended as an alternative counterculture . <p> Although the term " popular culture " is extremely ambiguous and all definitions are deficient and limiting , it is necessary to make a distinction between popular culture , folklore , and mass culture . While all of them compete for the same public , they are produced ( emitted ) by different social classes and through very diverse means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by the mass media , which are controlled by powerful corporations usually related to foreign capitals ; folklore -- or culture of the people -- originates among the consumers themselves ( use value ) ; 8 and popular culture is produced by professionals , generally pertaining or related to middle-class intellectuals ( establishment or intelligentsia ) , who premeditatedly choose and elaborate certain messages directed at molding the collective imaginary of those popular masses. 9 Of course , there are no clear-cut boundaries on this continuum between mass culture and folklore , and though popular culture can express very diverse ideological orientations , in the Uruguayan context it is possible to apply Mattelart 's definition : <p> Between mass culture and popular culture is the distance that separates the system whose legitimacy is founded upon the subjugation of conscience and a system in which the " masses " cease to be the submissive spectators of a representation contrary to their interests and become the active subject of cultural experience linked to their own project of liberation. 10 <p> Obviously linked to Gramsci 's concept of people-nation , 11 this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted by the intelligentsia during the ' 50s and ' 60s that contributed to the uprooting of the State 's foundations . <p> It is then that the military bursts onto the scene . Faced with the undermining of its superstructure and at the verge of political collapse , the State reacted through terrorism and the implementation of fascist-modelled cultural policy . The critical necessity of the military regime to silence all dissident manifestations was complemented by a strategy designed to manipulate and mold cultural standards according to its own ideological parameters , which , briefly stated , are : 1 ) an ultra-nationalist discourse articulated around the " Doctrina de la Orientalidad " Doctrine of Uruguayanism , at odds with the open sell-out of the country through the neo-liberal economic policies of the " Chicago boys " ; 2 ) the Armed Forces as the core and last resource of nationhood ; 3 ) the absolute hegemony of mass media and other channels of communication ; 4 ) a strict ideological-cultural verticality ; 5 ) the militarization of civil society ; 6 ) the National Security Doctrine as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalism both as an unifying ideology and a smoke screen ) was implemented through totalitarian control over organizations disseminating information and culture , and by exiling or imprisoning numerous artists and intellectuals , which generated the virtual decapitation of the intelligentsia . At the same time , the regime carried out an ineffective campaign to recruit cadres of its own while it also regimented all levels of the educational system . Although mainly unsuccessful in modelling a new social imaginary , and in thus expanding its social base , the institutional rupture of 1973 led to the fragmentation of Uruguayan society into three groups : the imprisoned , the exiled , and the insiled . Insile -- or exile within the country 's borders -- refers to the relationship of the individual with a power legitimized through obedience and terror. 13 <p> Although the impact of prison experience would be made a social one after the amnesty of 1985 , during the years of state terrorism it could only be felt in a ghostly manner , as an implied , ever-present taboo in a divided reality . The other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generators of the period 's cultural production. 14 <p> The culture of exile , nurtured by well-known artistic and intellectual figures , would find itself struggling to survive amid nostalgia for the place ( home ) snatched from them , the violent contact ( permeation , assimilation ) with other cultures , and desolation in light of the catastrophic collapse of the ideomyths that had sustained an arcadian , Europeanized , civil state , that " model country " designed as a refined system for the absorption of social contradictions. 15 An imaginary Uruguay had exploded into pieces under the pressure of reality : the " Switzerland of America " had turned into a distant , poor , and dearly loved " little country . " 16 <p> In contrast to the culture of exile , the study of countercultural production from within the daily matrix of insile takes on particular relevance . Under the regime of terror 's asphyxiating machinery , the insiled dissociated him/herself both psychologically and socially and became adapted to an omniscient and omnipresent system of violation . State terrorism generates a " mysticism of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination , since it shifts the thresholds of control beyond the point where power truly reaches . This is due to the involuntary complicity of the victim , who , surviving at " the limits of transgression , " becomes encapsulated and overwhelmed , and then feeds into his/her own alibis for being afraid. 17 <p> This is the climate in which the " generation of silence " develops . This generation , alienated by the culture of terror , cut off from models and teachers , deprived of the collective memory of arcadian Uruguay , will seek to find its own image in the interstices of unanimous silence . From this emerges the phenomenon of canto popular , the period 's richest cultural experience : <p> Canto popular presents itself as a music based on rural or urban folkloric roots , with high quality poetic texts , and as a search for unadulterated popular song , expressing itself above all through the singer of ballads . Its open stylistic linkage with the protest song of previous generations shows it to be a musical phenomenon still pertaining to an educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continental phenomenon of nueva cancion new song , 19 retains its own particular characteristics . According to Behague , the nueva cancion <p> tended generally toward the stylized , urban rendition of folk genres rather than the commercial , international pop styles fashionable in industrialized societies of the period . Song texts were meant to express and promote the ideology of the socialist political movement , involving primarily the expression of nationalist independence , populism , and the consequent criticism of foreign exploitation and domination. 26 <p> Canto popular , however , although sharing some of these features , and despite the efforts to highlight its continuity with the ' 60s classics ( a reverent mention , a coded allusion , as well as explicit intertextuality in repertoires and arrangements ) , 21 is a virtual orphan . It differs from the protest song in that it does not originate under the auspices of a popular political-cultural wave , 22 but rather under the most adverse conditions of repression and censorship which are naturalized by the everydayness of insile , " where living under a military dictatorship had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal discomfort . A normal cancer . " 23 These factors determine not the registering of a rousing or propagandistic political message , but rather the formation of an agglutinative ( ideological and liturgical ) socio-cultural gathering for young people deliberately disintegrated and kept on the margins of historical process . From this develops canto popular 's main task : the creation of a new imaginary , an authentic counterculture , an alternative to the compulsory acculturation fomented by the military regime 's submission to foreign influence. 24 <p> The faltering and difficult beginnings of almost underground groups and concerts built up , step by step , a fair number of musicians and poets who would seek to open up spaces for communication , necessarily dysfunctional with respect to hegemonic culture , with a young , urban , middle-class public. 25 Nineteen seventy-seven , considered the " year of resurgence , " marked the launching of numerous concerts and shows combining both music and theater. 26 In the years following , new artists were constantly added , and concerts multiplied to the point of market saturation in 1979-80 , culminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 that took shape as a sort of ritual exorcism of the discourse of power , a rite of initiation in the pathos of the masses . As a young spectator says : <p> There was a communication problem we were suffering from , and somehow , maybe not totally , it helped us socially to go out a little , to go out after listening in secret to a record in your house , maybe not with direct political lyrics , but that still insinuated something and all of that meant a lot in Canto Popular . . . and to a degree , too , everything that had to do with the fervor , the atmosphere all those people together creates in you , a certain spirit in common , you found it there and that 's all. 28 <p> As much musically as poetically , canto popular is an aesthetically heterogeneous and eclectic movement , 29 an experimental compendium of genres , where diverse variations of rural folklore , the urban sources of the tango , the candombe and the murga , vernacular jazz and rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when the musical framework shows great creativity and vigor , the text is considered the principal axis of the song : " We have always been interpreters , vehicles for the projection of sung texts " . 31 The act of communication , the un-repeatable instance of utterance , is the distinctive feature of canto popular . Similarly , the movement operates as a heterogeneous unity , 32 organized in " work groups " in which artists participate on collective projects while each maintains his/her own individuality. 33 There is a permanent exchange of artists which makes each show or recording a unique product , and this underlines , in its very mode of production , canto popular 's nature as metaphor for class alliances that keep up resistance to the dictatorship . <p> But although canto popular 's main goal is , then , the reconstruction of the collective memory and , through it , of national identity , several strategies can be distinguished . This paper will introduce some of the most significant ones , through a brief examination of three hit songs . ( Complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " A redoblar " " Roll the Drums " : Remaking the Future34 <p> Of all the urban folkloric rhythms reclaimed by canto popular , those from carnival stand out , especially the candombe , of remote African origin , and the murga , which stems from the Cadiz carnival. 35 The murga is a group of twenty to thirty members who sing and dance , with a rudimentary but characteristic choreography , and who are accompanied by percussion instruments : drums , cymbals , and bass drum . The classic staging of a murga includes an introduction , songs , and farewell . By extension , such compositions , their rhythms and vocal harmonies constitute the genre . <p> Some of the most successful ' 60s protest songs were based on murga , but around 1980 a murga explosion occurred . Some reached recording studios and , thus , numerous murgas and " antimurgas " emerged but not as part of the commercial carnival circuit. 36 The murga 's success is due to its enormous aesthetic malleability . Indeed , it is an under-coded genre whose loose structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , harmony , pitch , and choreography without diminishing its " murguistic " quality . Another factor in its success is carnival itself : <p> Carnival fascinates because of its unprejudiced , critical and satiric language and its permanent dynamic ( which brings together in itself almost all art forms ) and because it has been both a witness and a scourge for Montevideo 's conservative cultural system. 37 <p> The mere choice of murga as the mode of expression is a statement in and of itself . This is particularly noticeable in " A redoblar " by Mauricio Ubal and Ruben Olivera , which immediately after its 1980 release , became a hymn of resistance to the dictatorship . The song reflects traditional murga staging in its structure , that is : introduction , songs , and farewell . The introduction , written in the future tense , stresses the certainty of joy or , in other words , the proximity of a true carnival , in opposition to the present masquerade ( **33;204;TOOLONG cardboard ) . The songs are patterned in three stanzas that reiterate the title 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is a summons , an exhortation , a shout in an absolute present ( " tonight " ) projected onto the future . The verb " redoblar " has three possible -- and metaphorically interrelated -- meanings : to roll the drums , to redouble ( as in efforts ) , and to bend something over . The first stanza combines the meanings of rolling the drums and bending over ( their shadows , their astonishment ) , in order to banish present ( false ) reality . The second stanza concentrates on the beating of drums ( carnival drums , war drums ? ) but the trucks of the night allude to the nocturnal , political and clandestinely written graffiti as well as to the itinerary of the mourgas from one street stage to another , with the city itself forming the backdrop . In the third stanza the meaning is to redouble hope , accentuated in the beating of blood and heart , as drums in the city . So , the three meanings of " redoblar " oscillate and combine to empty out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , two parts ( the introduction and the songs ) , and two tenses ( the denied past and a welcome future ) , converge and become superimposed , redoubling the meanings while , supposedly , the murga departs . " Brindis por Pierrot " " Toast by Pierrot " : Nostalgia for the Past38 <p> While " Roll the Drums " seeks , in a squandering of militant optimism , to reconstruct the collective imaginary in favor of the future , Jaime Roos 's song clings to the shreds of a mythified ( and mystified ) past . His work , arranged around the commonplace of ubi sunt , is an elegy for the absent , vanquished protagonists of a lost world . The song evokes characters , events , and places in the geography and mythology of carnival in manner reminiscent of the tango . It alludes bisemically to the exile and to the loss of referential norms in a disrupted society . Those who have left and those who keep on leaving for whom carnival evokes " this night for remembering " through its vicarious street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arcadian Uruguay thai has left ( disappeared ) with them . <p> Thus , the text operates on the deep layers of a dormant collective memory , entrenched in minuscule events from the tabloids and obscure neighborhood characters . The song 's rendition by the murga " Falta y Resto " and soloist Canario Luna , whose voice pitch , diction , and inflections immediately immerse the audience in the carnival atmosphere , evokes the symbolic recuperation of life on carnival 's stages . <p> Roos , making use of the cyclical ritual of carnival and its popular urban mythology , proceeds to reconstruct a topos place . And even though he may not mean to propose this , this topos is projected onto an imaginary cronos time . Nostalgia ( of both exiled and insiled ) for their lost city implies the desire to regain a time and a society that refer to the utopic and uchronic " Switzerland of America . " Nostalgia , in this way , sets a trap that enervates historical conscience : <p> The past is revitalized and is more present than real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an isotope of " real " identity . Hope , prohibited for a future that no longer exists , is directed toward the reconstruction of the past , in whose phantasmagorical mythology , the significance of its own existence finds an echo. 39 " La leyenda de la metamorfosis perpetua del principe ogro " " The Legend of the Perpetual Metamorphoses of the Ogre Prince " : The Wheels of History40 <p> Leo Masliah , in a manner quite different from previously mentioned composers , does not build on folkloric patterns , but rather on unconventional poetic and musical ones . His scores flirt with atonalism and minimalism , while his " mesopoetry " fuses black humor , the absurd , the grotesque , and " concrete poetry . " Music and text , instead of blending together , work as a contradictory composite at once irritating and explosive in which ' noises " become messages . <p> In the text under analysis , the power of the State-ogre prince resides in its extraordinary capacity for mutation , permitting the adoption of the most diverse forms depending on historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " presumed distiller of virtues " can " dye his aristocratic blue blood the color of the venom of the emerald serpent of South America " and return to his " original form of mean ogre . " Cyclical time that erases memory combines with a denunciation of social alienation to reveal the true nature of a State power that reiterates Latin American history by means of an intertextual allusion to Nicolas Guillen 's " Sensemaya . " The " Legend . . . " is thus an allegory of the State that presides over Uruguayan history , its partial accomplishments and endemic frustrations , which , in a " gattopardesque " exercise of power , yet again , " returning to his past " becomes the paladin of liberty , equality , and fraternity . The lure of a " return to normality " is , for Masliah , a Machiavellian transmutation which , under the supposed restoration of constitutional rule in 1985 , restores conformity to a structurally unmodified status quo . The hegemonic power of a plagued and discredited State disguises itself in resorting to the ideomyth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The " Legend . . . " condenses the possibilities and limits of Masliah 's " mesopoetry . " The text 's density , its monotonous lexical accumulation , the syncopated rhythm , as well as Masliah 's metaphorical fireworks and irreverent use of chiche , clearly exceed the limits of the popular . The text 's images , although commonplace , are given new dimensions through their interweaving in a structure controlled by a highly intellectualized concept of history . <p> The fusion of music-lyrics is perfect , but in order to achieve this perfection Masliah has reduced the musical score to a minimum : an enervating rhythm and a chorus-commentary underline the irritating textual bombardment , while a stereophonic counterpoint multiplies the voices , creating an illusive and mobile dimension in which the listener wanders . Conclusions <p> In spite of their differences , these three songs ( strategies ) pertain to the same cultural phenomenon , are nurtured by the same socio-political climate , and aim for the same goals . They do not relate to any particular political discourse , but are extremely political nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they arose in the margins of culture as artistic expressions of resistance to hegemonic fascist discourse , and as such , as a counterculture . They performed a cohesive socio-ritual role among the new generations and , finally , they provided overlapping answers to the following questions : What is national culture ? If it exists at all , where are its roots ? What is the role of popular culture in sustaining collective memory and reshaping the social imaginary ? <p> " A redoblar " ( 1980 ) coincides with the high point of popular resistance , of which it became a hymn . It relies on carnival 's popular essences as a tool to dismantle the meshes of insile . ' " Brindis por Pierrot " ( 1985 ) expresses nostalgia for a mythified past -- a refuge from the present -- as a late expression of insile under the dictatorship . " La leyenda . . . " ( 1985 ) , projecting itself into the future implications of the present return to democratic rule , warns us of the lures of a collective memory destined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that canto popular , born under severe socio-political constraints , starved to death with the return to liberal democracy . Its reason for being disappeared along with the military regime , precisely because canto popular was born to resist dictatorship , to embody counterculture , and to ritualize hope . In fact , democracy destroyed a movement that had endured and thrived under fascism . This paradox leads us to a final question : What are the paths of an alternative popular culture under democracy ? That , too , is another story . <p> 
@@4020741 The growing scholarly interest in an interdisciplinary approach to studying the past has produced a new understanding of the British Atlantic economy , particularly coastal Carolina , where the rice crop ranked alongside the sugar of the West Indies , tobacco of the Chesapeake , and the cod of New England . For the past quarter century , there has been a steady stream of works defining South Carolina 's place within a world where a distinct plantation economy and society had emerged well before the American Revolution . Considerably less attention has been paid to placing colonial Georgia within that same context .

In the development of South Carolina 's merchant community , Scotsmen had played a critical role , especially in the early and middle years of the colony . By the 1760s , however , the Scots were only one element , albeit an important one , among a group that drew on Huguenots , New England sea captains , Sephardic Jews , Dutch , and English .

( n2 ) <p> Something else occurred that has attracted little attention -- the arrival after 1750 of a number of Scots who put a distinct stamp on colonial Georgia and provided much of the direction for its economic development . They were not as visible as earlier groups , for they came as individuals or families , and their impact was more financial and economic than political or cultural . Despite their low profile , they brought an aggressive entrepreneurial spirit , solid commercial know-how , precious access to capital overseas , invaluable ties with merchant houses in the British Isles and the West Indies , and on occasion much-needed professional training .

Instrumental in tying Georgia to the trans-Atlantic community in the early 1760s , these merchants stood at the heart of two rich ironies . First , they were to play a critical role in the creation of a highly stratified society in coastal Georgia , facilitating the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few . At the same time , they played a central role in creating opportunities for middle-class planters , traders , and artisans , and brought about a surprising degree of social mobility even on the coast . The comparative absence of class tension in colonial Georgia owed much to the success of their activities .

Once slavery began in 1750 and the announcement made that a royal government would be created , interested onlookers took heart . Carolina planters surged across the Savannah River to obtain rich rice lands and led the effort to create a plantation-based economy modeled after that of South Carolina . In response , the fledgling merchant community attracted a different kind of individual . In January 1753 , only five or six men in Savannah arguably merited the title of merchant ( those engaged in imports and exports and able to provide a degree of credit ) ; perhaps another dozen were shopkeepers . By the end of the year , there were as many as eleven or twelve men who could claim the title . The person who had virtually created the profession , James Habersham , began to back away from the daily routine of business to concentrate on his rice plantations and political role , leaving ample space for others.

Former surgeon in the royal navy and married to the daughter of a merchant , he brought thirty to forty slaves , a number that put him among the colony 's largest owners , and went on to practice medicine , operate a plantation , and lead what was , for a time , the largest trading firm in the colony . By way of contrast , the twenty-one-year-old Robert Baillie needed a way out of financial difficulties . His father had sent him to Jamaica to try his hand in commerce .

Young Baillie closed his store , became a planter , and bought his first two enslaved Africans from Graham. ( n4 ) <p> Although Georgia 's economy gathered momentum slowly during the 1750s , Scottish merchants continued to drift into the province . Their timing was serendipitous . While other colonies struggled through an extended depression after the Seven Years ' War , which ended in 1763 , Georgia experienced a dramatic increase in population , production , and shipping . During the last fifteen years of British rule the number of whites tripled ; that of blacks more than tripled ; the value of exports rose dramatically from 20,852 to 121,677 , and the ships clearing port soared from 37 to 217.

Of the twenty-four firms or individuals who advertised in the Georgia Gazette in 1768 and merit the classification of " merchant , " perhaps twelve came from Scotland . Of the three largest export firms in Savannah , all were in the hands of Scotsmen : John Graham and Company , long a fixture on the Bay , the street closest to the Savannah River ; Cowper , Telfairs , created in 1766 , and an overnight success ; and Gordon , Netherclift , a branch of a Charleston firm heavily vested in the Indian trade . Below this tier were four firms with access to London capital , all with Scottish connections : Read and Mossman ; George Baillie and Company ; Samuel Douglass and Company ; and Inglis and Hall.

( n7 ) <p> Augusta presented a more complex picture . Although it attracted settlers on their way to lands opened by the treaty of 1763 , this frontier town remained dominated by the trade with Creek Indians . The merchants represented a breed apart , a rougher cut of men accustomed to purchasing their strouds , duffels , guns , and powder in Charleston , sending out packhorse trains to Indian villages , empowering their traders to negotiate prices for deerskins , sometimes honestly , often less so .

Scotsman Robert Mackay came from Jamaica by way of Charleston and formed an alliance with one of the old-line companies . A fellow countryman , Andrew McLean , shipped out his first trains of packhorses in mid-1765 , and became one of the principal suppliers of skins to John Graham and Company in partnership with a talented Englishman , James Jackson , who had arrived earlier.

John Gordon , merchant of Charleston and Savannah , seems to have been a relative of Lord Adam Gordon , who played a key role in funneling investments of the high and mighty of Britain into East Florida . And even the more modest came from mercantile backgrounds . Robert Baillie 's father and uncle were businessmen in Edinburgh .

After the Revolution , London merchants claimed pre-war debts owed by Georgians at 247,781 , a figure that included interest of 99,000 . That number placed the colony fifth out of the twelve for which figures exist . Ironically , the province , whose very existence seemed in question as late as the 1740s , received a disproportionately generous inflow of funds from some of the shrewdest minds operating in the trans-Atlantic world in the 1760s and early 1770s . Clearly , the London elite who plotted financial strategy in Nicholas Lane , Lombard Street , and Old Bethlem saw Georgia as the next South Carolina and were willing to make the necessary investments . The colony 's debt amounted to 41 percent of South Carolina 's , an extraordinary figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , 11.4 of debt per white person in Georgia versus 7.4 in South Carolina. ( n10 ) The figures gain added importance from the fact that , by the end of the colonial period , South Carolina generated internally the bulk of the capital used in its development . The assets of local merchants , private individuals , and charitable societies provided the greater part of funds through an active and well-financed mortgage market . With Georgia still young and dependent on the mother country , the reverse was true . Entrepreneurs generated some capital internally and from South Carolina , but the vast majority came from Britain itself , specifically a small number of merchants and traders in London. ( n11 ) <p> The working relationships that developed between Savannah and London came about in response to specific opportunities . In 1762 , John Graham decided to expand his operation , especially in the Indian trade . He entered into partnership with John Clark , a London merchant with Scottish connections who had long been a leading player in the Carolina rice trade . Graham simultaneously brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the premier Indian traders in Georgia . McGillivray was a larger-than-life personality . Resident in an Upper Creek town , he had taken an Indian wife , became partner in a firm that monopolized the Indian business in Augusta , and served as adviser to governors in two provinces . He was shrewd , ambitious , and with a keen desire to turn himself into a Savannah gentleman . He had recently moved to the city and purchased one of the nearby river plantations . The new London firm of McGillivray , Grahams , Clark operated with a one-quarter interest held by McGillivray , one-quarter controlled by John Clark , and one-half interest in the hands of brothers John and James Graham . James Graham moved to London to handle the business end of matters but , before leaving Georgia , solidified the firm 's position in the Indian trade by marrying the daughter of the Scotsman who served as superintendent of Indian affairs for the southern department . It was a powerful combination. ( n12 ) <p> From the middle of the 1760s onward , the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Started as a place that would be free of the social evils of other American colonies , the province ended by adopting the institution as " the one thing needful " to insure economic growth . The colony achieved a positive sense of self based on the prosperity engendered by the work of thousands of Africans . Scottish merchants stood in the forefront of the slave trade . In the fifteen years between 1750 and 1764 , they had played a role in importing a modest number of slaves , some 637 from the West Indies and 1,238 transshipped from South Carolina , hardly enough to sustain a rapid expansion in the cultivation of rice . John Graham , Lewis Johnston , and others had brought small numbers of " seasoned " slaves into Georgia , those who had been " broken in " on sugar plantations in the Caribbean , typically no more than half a dozen at a time given the thinness of the market . Many came from St. Kitts , where the long-standing ties of the Scots provided a special connection. ( n13 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in 1766 the first shipments arrived directly from Africa . In the decade before the Revolution , local merchants presided over the sale of 7,950 bondsmen . The firm of Cowper , Telfairs led the way with fifteen cargoes or slightly more than two shipments a year on average , followed by Inglis and Hall , John Graham and Company , George Baillie and Company , Clay and Habersham and Company , and smaller vents by new merchants like the Scottish firm of Moore and Panton . The enterprise of Cowper , Telfairs enjoyed a meteoric rise . Opening its doors in 1766 , it was the largest business in the province seven years later . William Telfair , former agent of a Scottish tobacco firm in Virginia , had come to Savannah some time before , attempted to set up in the Indian trade , and established a partnership with one of the more prominent local merchants . In 1766 , his younger brother , Edward , joined him . He had also started as a storekeeper in Virginia , had worked in North Carolina , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " indicating a search for connections and status in the Caribbean . The two met Basil Cowper , who appeared in Georgia to handle the investments of his uncle , a Scottish merchant in the Carolina trade . Cowper was young , had adapted to life as a favored nephew , and joined Gov . James Wright 's squad of forty gentlemen and seamen who walked the streets of Savannah in early 1766 to enforce the writ of the Stamp Act . He brought his uncle 's financial backing to the partnership and a certain social standing . The Telfairs added business acumen and a voracious appetite for dominating the market. ( n14 ) <p> The London branch may have done business under the name Telfair , Cowper , Telfair , but it followed Savannah 's lead . A future governor of Georgia , Edward Telfair had an unerring eye for assessing risks . In August 1773 , the Guinea ship Francis made a late arrival from Senegal with 115 slaves for the account of Governor Wright , the English subminister William Knox , and John Graham . Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the shipment off their hands on condition of handling the sale on a strictly commission basis . " We would not have engaged in this adventure had it not been that some of our considerable planters would have been drawn from the House had they gone into the hands of any other Merchants here as this is the first cargo imported this year , " he told William Thomson . In fact , he split the sale with another Scottish merchant , found one planter willing to buy forty of their number , and disposed of the total for a noteworthy 4,850 , despite the fact that the shipment contained the weak and vulnerable , young boys and girls , several invalids , and men and women too old to be productive in the fields . This defensive step paid off . The house captured the market for export that year , sending 12,000 of goods to England , more than any other partnership. ( n15 ) <p> If slavery was crucial to the prosperity of even the average Georgian , the Scots could claim a fair share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of Charles Town did not reproduce at a sufficient rate to maintain their population , much less generate a natural increase . The imbalance of sexes , the harsh conditions on the isolated plantations , and the newness of Africans adjusting to a strange environment meant that any growth in numbers came from imports alone and , indeed , the available statistics suggest a net decrease of more than two thousand enslaved Africans . That one fact elevated the status of a Basil Cowper or Edward Telfair significantly . When a planter went into the slave pens of Savannah , he knew this was his best and perhaps only chance to expand his workforce . <p> Rice exports for Georgia were the most visible symbol of the impact of an expanded black population . By the end of the colonial period , the Telfairs , Grahams , Baillies , Mossmans , Reads , Douglasses , Spaldings , Munros , and Darlings , together with a handful of others , provided various services that permitted them to ship 23,540 barrels of rice by 1772 . They sent schooners upriver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and established the weight of each , arranged for drayage and storage in Savannah , obtained needed insurance and clearance papers , found space on vessels in the port , and worked with their agents in London to obtain the best price in the best market . In 1765 , eleven ships cleared Savannah and Sunbury for Britain . All were British bottoms , save one . Several local merchants pooled their funds , purchased a topsail ship , and sailed it into the Atlantic in a declaration of commercial independence . The " Georgia Packet " left on July 11 , bound for " Cowes and the markets , " loaded with 833 barrels of rice and several hogsheads of deerskin . The owners were prominent in the mercantile community : John and James Graham , Lachlan McGillivray , James Read , James Mossman , Alexander Fyffe , Joseph Clay , James Habersham , Jr. , together with John Clark of London and the sea captain ; seven of the ten were Scottish . That declaration of commercial independence was more symbolic than real . In 1772 , twenty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two owned in the province. ( n16 ) <p> By enabling rice production to expand so rapidly , the Scots facilitated the growth of a highly stratified society with a few families at the top . They extended credit to those planters who could afford the heavy costs of an efficiently run plantation : a work force of forty or more slaves , mastery of a sophisticated technology , and ample capital . The knowledgeable William DeBrahm estimated the cost of an average-sized rice plantation at 2,476 sterling , and this may have been an understatement , at least for a rice plantation using the tidal flow method , where the powerful tides coursing up a river could be harnessed to drive fresh water onto the fields at critical moments . Edward Telfairs 's accounts show individuals on the books for debts of more than one thousand pounds , most likely planters purchasing field hands . The reality , though , is that few Georgia planters employed the tidal flow method . It was too expensive , too complicated , and too new . Most , whether big or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first brought by Carolina planters along the Medway , Ogeechee , and Newport rivers , in which rice was grown in fresh-water river swamps with a simple irrigation system . Planters built a bank at the top and bottom of each field and constructed an impoundment pond above the field in order to release fresh water as needed. ( n17 ) <p> Entrepreneurs to the core , the merchants of Savannah knew where their long-term interests lay and became the leaders in adopting the tidal flow method , the most advanced technology employed in any industry , with its complex hydraulic landscape of banks , trunks , reservoirs , canals , floodgates , and ditches . Nowhere could they have faced a greater challenge than on the Savannah River . For the first thirty to thirty-five years of the colony 's existence , planters scarcely tapped the rich marshlands of that river for rice production , because of the difficulty in mastering the treacherous currents that washed through the marshy lowlands . To read the history of those estates in Mary Granger 's classic book , Savannah River Plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land speculation , cutting of timber along the banks , sale after sale in an effort to turn a profit or escape a crushing financial burden . The year 1762 proved a turning point . Three Scotsmen , John Gordon , Grey Elliott , and John Mullyrne , purchased a tract on Hutchinson Island , which had previously sold for a few shillings per acre . James Graham followed suit and developed Rice Hope Plantation alongside theirs , with 202 acres , a work force of almost sixty slaves , and an output of 250 barrels of rice and more than two thousand pounds of indigo . Lachlan McGillivray also invested in two large tracts on that island . The price per acre soared to more than 10 sterling , perhaps the most expensive land in the colony. ( n18 ) Along the banks of the Savannah River extending twelve miles westward , Scottish merchants dotted the landscape with their newly acquired estates . McGillivray planted at the ambitiously named Vale Royal , Basil Cowper on acreage that had once been part of the Musgrove Cowpen . Samuel Douglass took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and described it as " the best tide swamp in the highest state of cultivation , " capable of producing three hundred barrels of rice . Further upriver , John Graham shifted his resources to Mulberry Grove , where he added land and acquired slaves. ( n19 ) Carolina planters were the dominant element in developing the Ogeechee , Newport , and Medway rivers , but Scottish merchants played that role on the Savannah River . <p> While advocating the tidal flow method , the Scots nevertheless put considerable cash , goods , and services into the hands of those using the older , less efficient impoundment method ; this group included small planters , men of the middle class , and even the lower-middle class . The traditional image of the rapid accumulation of land in the hands of a wealthy few telescopes what was a much more involved process , oversimplifying a complex development . Trying to dam fresh water above a rice field was not efficient . Although planters ran the risk of damage by flooding or drought , the impoundment method did allow smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending credit to a broad range of rice planters , the Scottish merchants ironically promoted a degree of social mobility . Planters using the impoundment method may have been as small as Michael Burghaller , a German in St. Matthew 's Parish who , when he died , had six enslaved Africans , a crop of unthreshed rice , three rice mills , mortars and flails , and four sieves for rice . In the barn were five barrels of clean rice , worth 8 sterling . Or , more typically , there was James Pierce , illiterate as was his wife , but his holdings included fourteen Africans -- seven males and seven females -- together with the equipment needed for rice production , 110 head of cattle , fifty hogs , many bushels of Indian corn , and some lumber . Valued at 793 sterling , the estate was by no means inconsiderable . What gave value to their efforts were the merchants of Savannah and Sunbury , eager to do business . In 1764 , Edward Summer of St. John 's Parish sold eight barrels of rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cow and calf , and twenty hogs in Sunbury for 25 sterling , an amount sufficient to keep him operating for another year . In 1769 , Edward Telfair purchased six barrels of rice for 11 pounds , 8 shillings , and 5 pence from one small planter and 453 bushels of corn from an illiterate farmer for the handsome sum of 45 . These business dealings may have figured on the margin of what the larger merchants engaged in , but they pumped precious credit and pounds sterling into the hands of modest folk on the coast. ( n20 ) <p> The merchants also extended credit to craftsmen , artisans , and small shopkeepers , seeking out men moving up the economic ladder . The firm of Cowper , Telfairs granted a loan of 249 to Thomas Blount , carpenter of Savannah ; 90 to a distiller of Savannah ; 39 to a tailor ; and 300 pounds sterling to a local tavern keeper . Adrien Loyer came to Savannah as a silversmith and combined that trade with clocksmithing . At the beginning of the decade , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had acquired a significant amount of land and boasted of twelve slaves . On the eve of the Revolution , the books of Spalding and Kelsall showed debts carried by some 260 individuals , most of them in St. John 's and St. Andrew 's parishes , Liberty and McIntosh counties today . The number of large planters in those two areas could not have been more than sixty people , suggesting that credit went to a broadly representative group . When these smaller planters , artisans , and tavern keepers walked into the stores in Savannah or Sunbury , they commanded respect and attention for they could make the difference in a selling season. ( n21 ) <p> If the Scots of Savannah were successful in the commerce in rice , they succeeded even more rapidly in the trade with natives , albeit briefly . The export of deerskins had long been an important source of revenue on the southeast coast . For most of the eighteenth century , leather manufacturers in England turned deerskin into a wonderfully light , porous , and tough product that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckskin breeches enjoyed a fashionable elegance for a brief while and retained a long-term market with those possessing more modest budgets and who appreciated its durability . Until mid-century , deerskins represented the second most valuable commodity for South Carolina after rice . Georgia sat on the sidelines , although most of the hunting took place on its frontier and the skins passed through Augusta on their way to Charleston . By the beginning of the 1760s , Savannah had made gains , and a merchant like John Graham used his position to stake out a claim on the increasing trade . After the Revolution , a Scottish colleague recalled : " Knew Claimant from 1761 . He was then in a great way of Mercantile Business . His business was chiefly in the Indian trade . Being worth 5 or 6,000 sterling at that time would be esteemed being a Man of Fortune . " The following year , John Graham established the partnership that brought together one of the most prominent Indian traders in Georgia , Lachlan McGillivray , a leading merchant of London , John Clark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had improved by 1759 . In that year , the leading Indian merchant of Charleston , John Gordon , opened an office in Savannah , purchased a wharf lot , and put Thomas Netherclift , the son-in-law of his former partner , in charge . As a young man , Gordon had emigrated from Scotland to Frederica , where he supplied Oglethorpe 's Regiment during King George 's War ( 1740-1748 ) and , when the regiment disbanded , moved to South Carolina . He picked a good time for his return . The end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 removed the Spanish and French threat from the southeast ; the Creeks and Cherokees had nowhere else to turn for supplies , and the profit margins were high . The total trade in goods , according to a report submitted by Governor Wright to London , amounted to 23,961 sterling of British goods sold to the natives , compared to an estimated 11,500 in Georgia 's rice exports . If most of those goods passed through Charleston , an increasing amount came Savannah 's way . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transshipping the merchandise ; the Augusta storekeeper placed a 20 percent markup ; and the traders who actually carried the goods into the Indian territory added 30 percent in recognition of the proportionately greater dangers from packhorses dying on the trail , theft , and unpaid debts . Well over half of Georgia 's end of that trade ultimately passed through the hands of either Graham or Gordon. ( n23 ) <p> Over the next few years , the volume of trade in deerskins soared , from 42,000 pounds in 1762 to 308,000 six years later and , although it settled to something over 200,000 thereafter , the economics of the business turned against Savannah 's merchants . The seeds of the problem lay in the Proclamation of 1763 , intended to protect the natives of North America as well as the Indian trade itself from encroachment . Not only did settlers accumulate a strong sense of grievance at a measure designed to exclude them from native lands , but the proclamation opened that trade to any man who put up a small bond and obtained a license . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier became a competitive flee-for-all with desperate and inexperienced men , the dregs of colonial society , rushing in with disastrous consequences . A surplus of goods flooded Indian towns as they sought to make a quick fortune ; debts increased , while prices fell , often below cost , and creditors frequently went unpaid. ( n24 ) As seen in Table 3 , Savannah 's merchants did not proportionately benefit from the resulting expansion . West Florida exploded onto the scene to drain away increased production and cause anticipated revenues to shrivel even further , while Charleston stubbornly held its own . <p> By the eve of the Revolution , matters had reached a crisis at each level of the credit pyramid . The flow of merchandise from Britain -- guns , lead , powder , duffels , strouds , pots , knives , and other prized goods -- kept coming through the well-established pipeline that started in the manufacturing centers of Great Britain . That pipeline passed through London and Bristol , on to Savannah and Charleston , and from there to Augusta , Frederica , and Mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day of reckoning was at hand . James Jackson and Company of Augusta , the second-largest Indian trader in Georgia with twenty employees fanning out principally to the Upper Creek towns , owed John Graham some 19,400 , while Spalding and Kelsall owed 9,000 . Graham in turn was indebted to John Clark of London for those sums and more . In response , merchants put pressure on their traders for a greater volume of deerskins as the international market approached saturation . Hunters killed younger deer ; herds thinned to dangerous levels ; and the Creeks and Cherokees became increasingly unable to fulfill their obligations to pay for British goods . By 1773 , they owed the equivalent of 670,000 pounds of deerskins. ( n25 ) <p> Forced by necessity , the merchants of Augusta and Savannah grasped at a way out of their impasse -- canceling the debt of Cherokees and Creeks in return for possession of at least two million acres of Indian land north of Augusta , the rich , fertile soil coveted by land-hungry settlers coming into the state from North Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare the illegality of the transaction , he saw the advantages of convincing the British government to approve a modified version . The Creeks and Cherokees would surrender the land north of Augusta to the Crown in return for cancellation of all their debts . The government would sell the land to eager settlers and use the proceeds to repay the merchants for the amounts owed . Governor Wright appointed Andrew Robertson and Alexander Wylly , one an Indian merchant , the other a former Indian merchant , to verify accounts submitted by their colleagues , and named John Graham as collector of monies from the sales . Even had the sales taken place , it is unlikely that the scheme would have resolved the financial impasse . These merchants were still on the hook to their London creditors for dry goods worth considerably more than what they would have received . James Jackson and Andrew McLean owed John Graham , and eventually John Clark of London , some 19,000 against a certificate issued by the governor of Georgia for 9,963 , to be redeemed by the sales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The Treaty of 1773 that ratified the exchange of land for cancellation of debt had seemed an ideal way to merge the conflicting interests of land-hungry settlers with the economic concerns of merchants who defended Native Americans and their hunting grounds. ( n27 ) That hope quickly dissolved . When a band of renegade Creeks attacked two settlements in December of that year , leaving nine men , one woman , and four children dead , Governor Wright imposed an embargo on all trade . It was a potent tactic , as long as the principal merchants cooperated in the ban . Several did not . James Spalding of Frederica sent gunpowder , guns , and balls to his stores on the St. John 's River in East Florida and another shipment to the Lower Creek towns , where it was reported " that the Indians were flocking from all Quarters to Purchase the above goods , And that they had sold Seventeen Barrels of Rum in a few days . " Backcountry settlers were indignant at this proof of duplicity and the threat it posed to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove successful , and the Creek headmen executed two of the offenders in exemplary fashion . In the fall of 1774 , the settlers expected the governor to extract what they considered the minimum demand , the cession of the prized strip of land between the Ogeechee and Oconee rivers . Instead , Wright chose to bring peace to the frontier by siding with the Indian traders -- the Grahams , Baillies , McLeans , Mackays , Jacksons , Galphins , and Griersons -- and restoring relations with the headmen of the towns , whose prominent standing within their own communities depended on a steady supply of goods . A leading authority on colonial Georgia , historian Edward J. Cashin , calls that moment the turning point on the frontier , the instant when backcountry settlers , so supportive of the British government for protection against the Indians , reassessed their loyalty and began to look elsewhere for leadership , notably the emerging spokesmen of revolution in Georgia . That moment sealed the final divorce between Indian traders and inhabitants of the backcountry. ( n29 ) <p> To what extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the upcountry , become part of the newly emerging society within the colony as a whole ? A recent study of British policy and the southern frontier makes a case that the Scots involved in the Indian trade , and that included most of the merchants in Georgia , never fully assimilated into local society within the southeast , either on the coast or in the interior . Native white Americans not only regarded them with traditional English prejudice but also resented their overnight economic and political success , their access to overseas capital , and their close ties to British officials . For South Carolina , these arguments carry weight . That colony had been in existence since 1670 ; a native elite enjoyed deep roots and considerable prosperity , and resentment of Scottish merchants was endemic . For Georgia however , the term " outsider , " at least in terms of social and economic realities , applies less well . The colony was too young to have a native-born elite , and many Scots who arrived in the Trustee period occupied secure and honored places within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Sir Patrick Houstoun , named to the original Royal Council in Georgia and advisor to three governors , eventually became political figures . Others were dominant landowners in their parish , like Capt . Mark Carr , who founded the port of Sunbury . The Scottish town of Darien produced Lachlan McIntosh , son of the original leader of that Highland community and a dominant figure in the landowning elite of south Georgia . To these could be added the Scots who migrated from South Carolina like James Bulloch and his family or James and Audley Maxwell , names that commanded respect and attention throughout the colony. ( n30 ) <p> The new Scots who came to Georgia after 1750 faced a greater challenge , for they lived in towns , not the countryside , pursued a profession that did not arouse the same feelings as a planter or army officer , and kept more to their own . Of twenty Scottish merchants who married in Georgia during the colonial period and for whom records can be found , fourteen stayed within their community . Of that number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planter who moved his family from St. Kitts in the mid-1750s , and provided a rallying point for the West Indian interests . John Graham wed Frances , and Alexander Wylly married Susannah . Edmond Tannatt took Elizabeth , and George Baillie , a Scottish merchant who moved from Charleston to Savannah , chose Jourdina . When Tannatt died an early death , his widow married yet another Scottish merchant , James Mossman . Perhaps the most notable family portrait to come out of colonial Georgia captures the Crooke and Tannatt families and their in-laws ; the group is seated on the gracious , spreading lawn of a family plantation . Their dress is elegant ; the pose was aristocratic ; a sense of worldly success and familial well-being permeates the scene , with its fishing rods , live oak trees , and plantation house in the background , all bespeaking an ease that seems far away from the hustle of the mercantile world that made this conspicuous display of wealth possible . The elegant painting disguised well the origins of James Mossman in a counting house. ( n31 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully thought-out way . Although Edward and William Telfair both married late , they had their eye firmly fixed on becoming part of the emerging colonial elite . At age forty , William wed Elizabeth , daughter of Edmund Bellinger , a wealthy landowner in South Carolina , and a man who bore the exalted title of landgrave , a carryover from the days of the Proprietors . His brother married the daughter of William Gibbons , also a wealthy South Carolina planter who had moved his considerable holdings of slaves across the river to profit from the newly opened rice lands . Thirty-nine years old with a bride of sixteen , Edward intended to make a bid for power and connections . Yet , to all appearances , it was a happy marriage , producing nine children and a family name that still echoes in Savannah today. ( n32 ) <p> Socially , the new Scots made their way with apparent ease . Shortly after their arrival , the Graham brothers joined Solomon 's Lodge , the recently reconstituted Freemasons of Georgia . Three other compatriots belonged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution and became the second Provincial Grand Master of Georgia . The Highlander Lachlan McGillivray , despite his Creek wife , moved with consummate ease in the circles of other planters and merchants who traveled about in phaetons and riding chairs , dressed in silk breeches and raced horses . As his biographer pointed out , McGillivray above all epitomized the social revolution taking place in Georgia , the rise of men of checkered background into the ranks of Savannah " gentlemen . " The more public events ratified these developments . When a grand jury convened for Christ Church Parish in 1769 , seven of the twelve men were merchants , five of them Scots . Even where the Scots seemed distinctive , their institutions melded with the established order of things . The members of Independent Presbyterian Church included virtually the whole of the Scottish community in Savannah , but the church had been established by Jonathan Bryan , William Gibbons , and James Edward Powell , as good a slice of the English colonial elite as to be found . When the Scots founded a revitalized St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed . The columns of the Georgia Gazette carried letters expressing concern at the spirit of exclusivity and clannishness of the new organization , fearful it would promote a dreaded " factionalism " in a relatively open society . But the club opened its doors to non-Scots for its annual St. Andrew 's dinner , and prominent Georgians like James Habersham joined in the partying. ( n33 ) <p> Politically , the Scots moved into positions of leadership early . In 1755 , two years after arriving , Lewis Johnson entered the Commons House of Assembly , the first legislative body in the colony 's history . Two years later , the governor appointed John Graham to be Clerk of the Accounts as well as Indian Commissary . Their influence was immediately visible . When the mechanics of Savannah demanded the Commons House of Assembly prevent growing competition of black artisans with white craftsmen , the West Indian lobby ( John Graham , Lewis Johnston , Alexander Wylly , a Scotch-Irish partner of Johnston from Tobago , and Edmond Tannatt , who came from St. Kitts ) organized a petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In effect , the Scotsmen lately of St. Kitts , Tobago , and London intervened in the most decisive moment of class tension in colonial Georgia , helping deliver a mere shell of a law to the frustrated " mechanicks. " ( n34 ) In 1760 , Scots represented eight of the twenty-one members of the Commons House of Assembly and , in subsequent elections , the number varied from five to seven . In each of the elections of 1768 and 1772 , four Scottish merchants returned to office . Where they most stood out , however , was on His Majesty 's Council , advisory body to the governor and upper house of the legislature . By 1765 , its twelve members included John Graham of John Graham and Company , Lewis Johnston , of Johnston and Wylly , Grey Elliott of Gordon and Elliott , and James Read , partner in Read and Mossman . Also on the council were two other Scotsmen , James Mackay and Clement Martin , still a part-time resident of St. Kitt 's . As late as 1775 , five of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scots had integrated well into the social order that had emerged by the time of the Revolution , a certain ambiguity underlay their presence . John Graham , one of the three most important figures in the colony , enjoyed an almost unbroken record of success in his twenty-two-year residence , and yet his ambition was to emulate the sugar barons of the West Indies . " Be as it will , I am fully determined to remain where I am till I can leave it on a proper footing , " he confided to his fellow Scotsman , Gov . James Grant , " for I must find myself in a situation to spend from 1,000 pounds to 1,500 a year in England , before I will show my face there , and when my plantations will afford this , I wo n't stay a month longer . " And therein lay the rub . If few of the Scots shared his intention of becoming an absentee owner , they remained connected to British society , tied to the trans-Atlantic world through the flow of capital and goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and privileges . As the political crisis between North America and Britain worsened , they increasingly derived their sense of identity from these connections and by the time of the Revolution defined themselves in ways that made them " outsiders " to increasing numbers of Georgians. ( n36 ) <p> The Stamp Act Crisis of 1765 was the defining moment when the new Scots began to assess their loyalties . When the enforcement of the act began on November 1 , most stamp distributors had already resigned or left the colonies ; ships sailed without stamped papers and colonial governors looked on helplessly . By early 1766 , the refusal of American colonists to buy stamped paper had effectively nullified the will of the British government , with one lone exception , the port of Savannah . In January 1766 , its merchants committed the unthinkable and purchased the detested stamps to send their cargoes on their way . When the governor closed the port in early December , these eager traders petitioned to find someone who would serve as temporary stamp distributor ; the official one was en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . During the last two weeks of December , Savannah witnessed the slightly comical sight of its men of commerce knocking on doors to recruit a person willing to incur the prevalent anger and brave enough to risk the lawsuits that might follow . On January 3 , the actual distributor arrived at Tybee Island , and in a few days the port reopened and the stranded vessels sailed . In the face of popular anger , James Wright smuggled the despised distributor out of town and into hiding on Robert Baillie 's plantation in south Georgia , an act that was to cost Baillie his seat in the assembly . When furious Americans threatened to destroy the house of the chief justice , an especially obnoxious Scotsman by the name of William Simpson , some sixty to seventy compatriots , including merchants , surrounded his place with muskets at the ready. ( n37 ) <p> In the wake of the crisis , the merchants learned a valuable lesson , that of maintaining a discreet silence in the face of the political firestorms that were to sweep the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia 's colonial assembly , and the repressive measures that followed the Boston Tea Party . They kept their heads down , fully immersed in the business of taking advantage of the boom conditions that still prevailed . Those merchants , and most especially the Scots , were blind to the gathering political storm and filled their correspondence with pleas to their London agents to keep the supply line furnished with choice goods . " We are fearful of any delay in the delivery of goods and merchandise , " Edward Telfair told his partners . " We hope to have in the next month some 2000 pounds upon the seas , " and warned the house would lose customers if the cargo did not arrive . By the eve of the Revolution , the London merchants had become uneasy at the dangerous overextension of their partners in Georgia . Still , until mid-1775 , London as well as Savannah did its best to keep that supply line filled.

John Graham left off being a merchant to concentrate more exclusively on land as the vehicle for wealth , becoming the largest proprietor in Georgia with some 26,000 acres . Samuel Douglass , correspondent for one of the great London houses , went from very little holdings at the beginning of the decade to 16,000 acres . James Spalding and Roger Kelsall purchased for their company more than 8,000 acres , primarily in St. John 's Parish . The records of land grants and purchases by the Scots showed no signs of slowing down in 1774 and early 1775 , even with news of the Battle of Lexington and the slide of the royal government into oblivion . Simply put , the hardheaded Scots believed that sustained economic growth had become a permanent feature of the landscape. ( n39 ) They did not seem overly concerned by the massive debt they had accumulated with their London correspondents either . In 1790 , that amount stood at 144,000 , with accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony fifth on the list of the most indebted . But in 1776 , that number was a staggering 261,337 , with the firm of Cowper , Telfairs owing 76,937 , John Graham and Company , 69,644 , and Samuel Douglass , together with Gordon and Netherclift , at least 61,185 . The year 1775 found the Scottish merchants in a virtually impossible situation ; they had become political outsiders and financially vulnerable. ( n40 ) <p> Despite this exposure , these hard-boiled merchants were to stand firm in defense of the Crown , even at the cost of their fortunes . When the Continental Congress imposed a blockade on exports , Savannah 's merchants paid little heed and continued to sell rice to East Florida and beyond . When a British fleet off Tybee Island demanded provisions of rice in February 1776 , they openly committed themselves to the Crown 's forces in the mock-heroic " Battle of the Rice Boats . " On March 3 , the British seized control of a fleet of rice boats next to Hutchinson Island .

Others retreated to their plantations , as Samuel Douglass later phrased it , " to protect my property and be able to pay off my debts in England . " In June , the president of Georgia addressed the Provincial Congress on the need to arrest those " whose going at large is dangerous to the liberties of America , " and that number included an impressive list of Scottish merchants still present : James Spalding , James Mossman , Samuel Douglass , John Inglis , David Douglass , Thomas Netherclift , George Kincaid , Thomas Reid , Robert Reid , and George Baillie. ( n41 ) <p> When the British marched back into Savannah in December 1778 , many of the Scots returned to resume their business and several played a notable role in the restored government : John Graham as lieutenant governor , Lewis Johnston and William Telfair , commissioners of the bureau of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Basil Cowper , Samuel Douglass , John Simpson , James Mossman , William Panton , Alexander Wylly , Simon Munro , James Spalding , George Baillie , and Robert Baillie , and elected but not serving , Andrew McLean and James Grierson .

Those in the assembly took a role in drawing up the Disqualifying Act , depriving 152 Georgians of their civic rights , and a later act that banished twenty-four individuals while confiscating their property . As if to pour salt in the wounds , the Scots led the charge in purchasing tracts of land attached for failure to pay debt , especially Basil Cowper and Samuel Douglass , who added considerably to their holdings.

" Cooler heads repealed the law , but the point was taken . The men who made up the Scottish merchant community in colonial Georgia departed , most for East Florida. ( n43 ) <p> The new Scots , men who came after the mid-century mark , disappeared with such finality that historians have ignored their role , and yet their work tells much about the nature of colonial Georgia . Historians have justifiably made much of the " Carolinization " that took place in Georgia after 1750 as Carolina planters moved onto the coast , bringing with them enslaved Africans and the plantation system that exploited them . The role of the Scots suggests this interpretation needs to be broadened . First , the Scots dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in South Carolina . They operated on a small stage and , to a large extent , controlled who walked on and off of that stage . It is only a bit too strong to say that commerce was a Scottish family affair . At Charleston , there were more native merchants than in Virginia and Maryland because business conditions were more like those in Philadelphia and New York . Georgia closely resembled Virginia , where Scotsmen operated small stores along the network of rivers . Yet it differed from Virginia in that three or four firms in Savannah controlled the bulk of the funds flowing into the colony , determining where the money was to go and under what conditions it was offered. ( n44 ) <p> The Scots faced an economy that posed the kinds of challenges Carolina had faced fifty years before . They confronted a slave population that could not yet reproduce itself , rice cultivation done by the relatively inefficient impoundment method , and a heavy dependence on the British government in the Indian trade . They skillfully took advantage of those facts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported British goods that tied Georgia to the commercial revolution , made rice exports the focal point for supporting the credits granted by London , took away from Charleston leadership in the Indian trade , and developed a costly new technology for rice plantations along the Savannah River . Of course , they made their share of mistakes . They clung to the Indian trade long after most Carolinians had moved on to more lucrative avenues . Commerce with the Creeks and Cherokees was the dark shadow that hung over an otherwise flourishing economy , the root cause of the alienation of the backcountry from Georgia 's economic leaders . <p> In their eagerness to promote financial development and reap the benefits of increased trade , the Scots lent money to a surprisingly broad range of people . Certainly they pushed for the concentration of rice land along the coast into the hands of a wealthy few . John Graham and Samuel Douglass were themselves spectacular examples of that process . But the limited evidence suggests the middle-class planter , with ten or so acres of rice and eight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitively using the inland swamp method , and found a good market for his crop . They also advanced funds to tavern keepers , shopkeepers , artisans , shipbuilders , sea captains , and farmers who produced the Indian corn and peas that fed the West Indies . The combination of these two phenomena was to create that irresistible sense of optimism and self-worth that dominated the last years of the colonial period . <p> Scholar Jack Greene remarked that Georgians had a genius for going against history : first the utopian vision of the Trustees , then a government constructed to maximize the power of London , and finally , the warm embrace of slavery , bucking larger currents in Western history . The sad truth was that slavery did hold the key to fortune in the lowcountry and not just for the wealthy . As many as half of the households in the lowcountry held slaves , and many more colonists sought to gain the status that came with slave ownership . Historians routinely note the marked social inequalities along the coast , but detect relatively minor manifestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension during the period 1760-1775 . The work of these Scots in spreading the wealth to a goodly segment of society was a significant part of the explanation. ( n45 ) <p> Politics interrupted the normal flow of events , and these men were quick to declare their loyalty to the system that nurtured them , the great trans-Atlantic economy that tied continents together in a giant exchange of goods and services for the mutual benefit of a surprisingly broad group of people . Again , unlike their peers to the north , they had toed the line of imperial policy , rarely challenging the misguided policies of successive ministries , following the rules regarding clearance papers and other bureaucratic minutiae , and refraining from the time-honored tradition of smuggling . It was ironic that their success in narrowly pursuing an aggressive capitalism ultimately helped undermine the imperial system . <p> The insiders of yesteryear quickly became the outsiders by 1776 .

The ensuing vacuum was a major factor in the realignment of power after the Revolution , with the upcountry claiming its due . In a not-so-subtle revenge , Augusta and the surrounding counties , Richmond , Wilkes , and Burke , stripped Savannah of political , and to a certain extent , economic power . The irony was that the leading Scottish merchant of colonial times , the nimble Edward Telfair , one of the few mercantile Scots to embrace the Revolution , transferred his base of operations to the upcountry and assisted his new colleagues in measures against the town that had nourished his early success.

@@4157941 The cultural material in interwar periodicals of protest is a vital site of information regarding the complex history of Canada 's early-twentieth-century " woman question . " It also has much to tell us about the tangled history of the welfare state in Canada and its relation to women 's discourses of reform , which might seem surprising , given that the magazine of interest here , The Woman Worker , was published between 1926 and 1929 by an affiliate of the Communist Party of Canada ( CPC ) .1 Yet , as later Communist periodicals such as Masses ( 1932-1934 ) and the Daily Clarion ( 1936-1939 ) attest , the CPC and its affiliates made significant contributions to nascent ideas about the welfare state in modern Canada . This is particularly true of the periods during which the CPC was engaged in " united " and " Popular Front " initiatives , through the 1920s and during the latter half of the 1930s , for example.2 Nonetheless , what Dennis Guest calls the " largely unrecorded history of attempts to introduce citizen participation ' into policy making and administration " ( 85 ) that is embodied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far left ) has not played much part in shaping narratives of the development of the welfare state in Canada.3 Less visible still is the role of women , and particularly working-class and immigrant women , in this ephemeral history of " citizen participation . " Important groundwork has been laid : studies in labour history , such as Margaret Hobbs ' and Joan Sangster 's invaluable 1999 survey of The Woman Worker , have mined early- and mid-twentieth-century periodicals of protest for their political arguments and as sources for social history , and literary critics have begun the work of analyzing the literary content of and the role played by women editors and writers within these publications.4 This essay will build on this historical and literary scholarship to examine how the cultural material in the pages of The Woman Worker plays a crucial role in its performance of protest . Yet the object of social and political change is not constant in The Woman Worker , a fact that can be attributed to the political and cultural eclecticism of its creators and readers and that testifies to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodical was engaging . A contradictory iconography and discourse of womanhood , and hence of political change , runs through the periodical 's poetry and fiction : if what one reader calls the " rebel woman " gestures obviously to The Woman Worker 's Communist affiliations , its support of equal-rights feminism , and its fraught negotiations with a masculinist tradition of workers ' verse , a figure I characterize as the " little woman " suggests its equally frequent recourse to the ideologies of parliamentary reform and maternal feminism , as well as its use and revision of the Anglo-American novel of social reform . # The Woman Worker and Its Contexts # Labour historians have long appreciated the value of the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century protest press , and their work is a wonderful resource for understanding its contents . By the 1920s , the leftist periodical press was a central part of creative and political culture in Canada . The first major leftist periodical in Canada was the weekly newspaper of the Nine-Hour Movement , the Ontario Workman ( 1872-1875 ) , which featured a fair quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of trade unionism and political radicalism in Canada . According to R W. Watt , by the 1920s , these periodicals " emerged not merely from the dissident minority among the working classes , but from the respectable middle-class intellectuals who had earlier remained aloof " ( 467 ) . Literary and cultural scholars in Canada have , for many years , acknowledged the importance of the mid-twentieth-century " little-magazine " movement , but only recently have scholars interested in the cultural history of protest begun to examine periodicals that an earlier generation of scholars deemed unliterary and thus outside the movement . While foundational essays such as Ruth I. McKenzie 's " Proletarian Literature in Canada " ( 1939 ) and Watts " The Literature of Protest " ( 1965 ) mapped out literary histories of protest in Canada that brought previously occluded periodicals into literary-critical view , these scholars also clearly felt ambivalent about the aesthetic qualities of the " horatory chants and indignant diatribes " they were recuperating ( Watt 471-72 ) . Contemporary critics such as James Doyle , Caren Irr , Dean Irvine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Watt , and find historical and cultural interest in the interwar leftist periodical press in Canada , particularly the press of the troubled 1930s and publications such as Masses and New Frontier ( 1934-1936 ) . Irvine and Rifkind follow trends in the new modernist studies and cultural studies ( for instance , in the work of Michael Denning and Cary Nelson ) and seek to validate Canada 's early-twentieth-century protest press by incorporating its experiments into the modernist fold . Indeed , in his history of women 's participation in Canada 's modernist " little magazine " movement , Irvine insists on the inclusion of interwar leftist publications such as The Woman Worker , claiming that despite its origins in the CPC newspaper The Worker ( 1922-1936 ) , its " typical little magazine format " renders it an example of a category that he modifies to include " those non-commercial literary , arts , and cultural-interest magazines whose editors facilitated and participated in the construction of a magazine culture for their contributors and readers--but not , primarily , for profit " ( 195 , 16 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literary modernisms arrival in Canada does not fully explain the literary , aesthetic , and political eclecticism of a periodical like The Woman Worker . # Left of such well-known progressive periodicals as the Canadian Forum ( 1920-2000 ) , numerous serial publications flourished in the 1920s ; The Woman Worker was one of them . The Woman Worker was published by the Toronto-based Canadian Federation of Women 's Labor Leagues ( CFWLL ) . Although Women 's Labor Leagues in Canada predate the First World War , these groups assumed a new organizational structure in the wake of the creation of the CPC in 1921.5 At the urging of the International Women 's Secretariat of the Communist International ( Comintern ) , the CPC set up a Women 's Department in 1924 and began to demonstrate a new " measure of sympathy for women 's particular oppression " ( Sangster 27-32 ) . This Department strove to centralize the scattered WLL movement under the Toronto-based CFWLL--a not inconsiderable task , given the mixed heritage of the movement in British WLLs and the Finnish " sewing circles " attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the ethnic diversity and regionally specific political priorities of these groups ( Hobbs and Sangster 8-9 ; Sangster 45-52 ) . Florence Custance was the national secretary of the CFWLL , and she became editor of The Woman Worker when it was launched as an organizational tool from an office at 211 Milverton Blvd. in Toronto in 1926.6 Modest in appearance but professionally printed by the Sutherland Printshop in Toronto , devoid of colour save the muted green front and back cover , small in stature ( just shy of twenty-four centimetres tall and sixteen centimetres wide ) , and almost entirely without images , the sixteen-page Woman Worker was antithetical in every way to the large-format , mass-circulation magazines with glossy paper and full-page illustrations that became so popular in the first decades of the twentieth century.7 It did , however , share a ten-cent price tag with its mass-market peers , such as Canadian Home Journal ( 1896-1958 ) . The Woman Worker attempted to reach readers who were bombarded by the visual pleasures of such periodicals as Canadian Home Journal , Mayfair ( 1927-1961 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some League members , such as the women who attended a 1926 miners ' picnic in Blairmore , Alberta , compared it unfavourably to its more colourful counterparts.8 # As a leftist periodical published by and for women , The Woman Worker represents a significant first in Canadian history : its contemporaries on the left--Holos Robitnytsi ( 1922-1924 ) and Robitnysia ( 1924-1937 ) , which were published by the Women 's Section of the United Labor-Farmer Temple Association--were edited by men , and more general attempts in the socialist periodical press to include women 's voices or to address their specific concerns were generally confined to " women 's columns " ( Hobbs and Sangster 8 ) . The Woman Worker began as such a column in 1924-- " The Working Women 's Section " of the CPC paper The Worker . If this initial effort in many ways anticipates the politicized character of its progeny , later women 's columns in CPC publications , such as the " With Our Women " column that ran during the 1930s in The Worker ( later called the Daily Clarion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political activists and more about their identities as homemakers who might be seeking recipes , housekeeping advice , and dressmaking patterns . Columns such as " With Our Women " spoke to working-class women by adapting but not fundamentally challenging the conception of women in new forms of mass media , such as mass-circulation magazines and movies . For example , in the 5 February 1936 issue of The Worker , the editor of " With Our Women , " Anne Smith , offers the column 's typical fare : a pattern for a suit " to brighten up the wardrobe , " a recipe for potato soup , and tips for removing white rings on wooden furniture ( 4 ) . Somewhat ironically , Beatrice Ferneyhough 's contribution to this column on 16 May 1936 laments the lack of a socialist magazine for working-class , Canadian women who must content themselves with the " nauseous gushings " of mass-market magazines ( 6 ) ; that Ferneyhough does not refer directly to the example set by The Woman Worker in the 1920s speaks to the marginal place that the CFWLL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPC. # The Woman Worker demonstrates an entirely different conception of its female reader than one finds in either the mass-market women 's magazines of the period or the women 's columns of the leftist press , distance made this clear in the first issue ( July 1926 ) , with her declaration that the periodical would " not contain fashions and patterns , and we are leaving recipes for cooking to the cook book " ( " Success " 33 ) . Like the WLLs themselves , which often formed book discussion groups and organized lectures , The Woman Worker took as its mission the education of its readers . Moreover , like Maurice Spector , the editor of the CPC paper The Worker , Custance was " prepared to acknowledge the promotion of literary culture as part of the papers responsibilities , " following the priority granted to the arts in post-revolutionary Russia , where a " dogmatic party line " concerning artistic production had not yet been drawn ( Doyle 62-63 ) . In each monthly issue , readers of The Woman Worker were treated to editorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a short story , poem , or book review ; and regular , frequently reader-authored features such as " Our Labor Leagues at Work , " " Our Educational Page , " " Notes and Happenings , " " Questions We Are Asked , " " Our Letter Box , " and " Shop and Factory Life . " Despite the fact that The Woman Worker declared itself , on the final page of every issue , in the service of " all working women , whether they work in the factory , at home , or in office , " the Leagues themselves , where most of the periodical 's readers were generated , " never brought in substantial numbers of wage-earning women " ( Hobbs and Sangster 10 ) . It is therefore striking that Custance chose not to repeat or adapt for working-class women the messages of the rapidly proliferating mass-circulation magazines that were aimed at North American housewives ; rather , she offered a political alternative that emphasized above all else the importance of unionization to working-class women and their families . # " Rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultural politics of The Woman Worker is the division in early feminist thought that historians identify as the split between equal-rights feminism and maternal ( or social ) feminism . If the first " held that women were entitled by right of their common humanity to equal rights with men , " the latter , which emerged from the late-nineteenth-century North American reform movement , " held that women were fundamentally different from men , and thus deserved access to specific rights ( such as the vote ) because they had by nature and by training ' maternal ' virtues such as compassion , self-control , nurturance , compromise , and moral purity " ( Dean 59 ) . As Misao Dean points out , this difference was not particularly visible in Canada 's first wave of feminism ( because equal-rights feminism was associated with US-American republicanism and because of other conservative influences in English-Canadian thought ) ( 119 , n. 4 ) ; however , analysis of The Woman Worker demonstrates that equal-rights arguments strongly influenced WLL discourse . For example , references to the new forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the legalization of abortion , the acceptance of civil marriage , an amended family law code that established women 's equal status in marriage ) are abundant in the pages of The Woman Worker.9 Somewhat paradoxically , these exaltations of equal rights are often articulated alongside the maternal-feminist arguments that the middle-class counterparts of the WLLs--the Women 's Christian Temperance Union , the Young Women 's Christian Association , and the National Council of Women--embraced. # Two figures who , in various guises , populate the pages of the periodical , illustrate perfectly the contradiction between equal-rights feminism and its maternal counterpart : the first , the " rebel woman , " is militant , unabashed in her demands for revolutionary change , a proponent of equal rights for men and women , and is almost never characterized as a mother ; the second , a figure I call the " little woman , " is a suffering mother who either struggles to make ends meet on her husband 's wage or is forced into " wage slavery , " suffers from poor health due to poverty and frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two figures demonstrate the ambivalent and sometimes contradictory feminist politics of The Woman Worker--a politics that must be understood in relation to several key related contexts : the " peripheral status of the woman question within the Party " ( Sangster 52 ) ; the diverse membership and relative local autonomy of the WLLs ; and the " united front " strategy of the periodical , which frequently led to collaboration with middle-class women 's reform organizations ( 4445 ) . Although Custance was a staunch Communist supporter and important party member , not all of the local leagues or their members reflected her radical political commitments , and there remained , throughout the existence of the League , " some tension between the firm Communist leadership provided by the Women 's Department and a more politically eclectic membership " ( Hobbs and Sangster 9 ) . For example , the ethnic diversity of the Leagues--there were Anglo-Canadian , Jewish , Finnish , and Ukrainian groups , among others--reflected the many traditions of leftist organizing that were activated under the name of the CF WLL , all of which brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " # I take the phrase " rebel woman " from the April 1928 issue of The Woman Worker , in which Custance reminds readers that she is seeking an image for the cover page . She notes that " our Rebel Woman " sent in a submission that " shows a working woman dressed as a soldier--with gun in hand--ready for action . " Custance s response is playful and approbatory : " But since we are not allowed to send pictures which depict violence through the mail , we shall be compelled to keep the picture in storage for the time being . It is far too good to be destroyed " ( " This Would Kill " 5 ) .10 Literally invisible to readers but evoked with a paradoxical mixture of humour and menace , the " rebel woman " was a militant , revolutionary figure who could not circulate easily in 1920s Canada ; nevertheless , she had a crucial function in the periodical . The CPC and the CFWLL viewed The Woman Worker as an " important counterweight " to the influence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewives ( Hobbs and Sangster 10 ) ; the " rebel woman " was perhaps the heaviest stone in this counterweight. # The figure of the " rebel woman " is particularly visible in the poetry that appeared in the pages of The Woman Worker . The ubiquity of this figure in the periodical 's poetry is not surprising , given the function poetry assumed in other leftist periodicals from the 1920s . Analyzing literary and cultural material in the CPC 's periodicals The Worker and Young Worker ( 1924-1936 ) , Doyle observes that contributors in the 1920s " seemed to find poetry more suitable than fiction to the expression of the positive aspects of the revolutionary struggle " ( 72 ) . Indeed , poetry appears more commonly than fiction in the pages of The Woman Worker , particularly after May 1927 , when a new column , " Shop and Factory Life , " largely displaced short fiction with " true " tales from shop and factory floors . As in many Canadian socialist periodicals from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries , creative content was often reprinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist writers in the 1920s ? continued , like their radical predecessors , to owe more to nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century British , Canadian , and US traditions than to the Russian Revolution and its aesthetic reverberations , " largely because socialists in Canada had little access to the aesthetic debates of post-revolutionary Russia until the 1930s ( Doyle 63-64 ) . Nonetheless , contributors to The Woman Worker had a rich " revolutionary chorus " of leftist songs and ballads from which to draw poetic inspiration . " One note in this chorus that seems especially important in the making of the " rebel woman " is US-American labour activist Joe Hill 's " The Rebel Girl " ( 1911 ) , which was a key text in the interwar , leftist repertoire of song . Hill was a popular songwriter for the Industrial Workers of the World , and " The Rebel Girl " announces the importance of women to revolutionary action : # That 's the Rebel Girl , that 's the Rebel Girl ! To the working class she 's a precious pearl . She brings courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've had girls before , but we need some more In the Industrial Workers of the World , For it 's great to fight for freedom With a Rebel Girl . ( 293 ) # While Hill 's " Rebel Girl " becomes a woman in The Woman Worker 's invisible icon , this insistence is not followed through in the periodical 's poetry , which often leaves the rebel figure deliberately unmarked in terms of gender , a fact that suggests the discomfort with which WLL members attempted to adopt the leftist " revolutionary chorus " as their own . # " A Rebel , " reprinted in The Woman Worker ( January 1927 ) from the Glasgow Forward ( " sent in by a reader of The Woman Worker " ) , offers a particularly good example of the optimistic , militant verse in the periodical that urged women to revolutionary action . Using the ballad stanza , which has deep roots in folk culture and masculine , working-class traditions of song , " A Rebel " exploits the well-known rhythm of alternating iambic tetrameter and iambic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker , who urges his or her silent auditor to action : # The time is ripe for action , Bill , Let 's stand together , true , And move to take the wealth we make , Shall we--me and you ? ( 13 ) # The speaker of " A Rebel " may offer a verbal corollary to the image submitted to The Woman Worker by " our Rebel Woman , " but the speaker 's gender is unclear , which may be the reason the poem was reprinted in The Woman Worker , where its ambiguity strongly suggests a woman speaker apostrophizing her meek mate . The ballad form of " A Rebel , " however , was a staple of popular workers ' verse for centuries in western Europe and North America , and the poem 's gender ambiguity can not eclipse the strong male tradition it exists within . Transposing the ballad to Canadian contexts , versifiers such as T. Phillips Thompson ( in his 1892 Labor Reform Songster ) and , somewhat later , Dawn Fraser ( whose pre-war ballads were collected in Songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 1919 ) were important figures in Canada 's late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century tradition of workers ' poetry . This was a resolutely male tradition , despite the presence of some female voices , such as that of Marie Joussaye.12 # Other poems sent to the periodical by readers from the WLLs complement the revolutionary optimism of " A Rebel . " " A May Day Tribute " ( May 1928 ) , for example , critiques the doctrine of Christian meekness and figures the inexorable coming of the revolution , again in the familiar rhythm of iambic tetrameter and with a dramatic nod to the international left in its concluding line : # It comes--O mighty , onward , surging force No earthly power can stay thy course From that inevitable meeting place Of uprising workers of every race All barriers shall be swept away Or thrown aside to rot-decay With Victory at last we 'll Hail THE WORKERS'INTERNATIONALE !

The employment of the first-person plural as a metonym for the international left is a strategy common to the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century male tradition of workers ' verse . The production of poems such as " A Rebel , " " A May Day Tribute , " and " Courage " in the pages of a periodical destined for women readers widens this collective " we " to include women , but the poems do not specifically apostrophize them . Contributors to The Woman Worker were clearly hesitant to employ verse as a form of protest specific to women 's experiences , probably because of the weight of the male tradition of workers ' poetry and song . Moreover , this tradition was amplified in its masculinism during what Ian McKay calls Canadian socialisms " second formation " ( 1917i935 ) " when a " tough-minded military language " and iconography permeated the leftist press ( 94 ) . # However , the ballad form was turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Woman Worker .

( 13 ) # Given the frequent attention devoted in The Woman Worker to the exploitation of young working " girls " and the dangers of the " white slave trade " and prostitution generally , this ballad , which speaks in the voice of a prostitute who wants to know why she should not " live on their wealth / As price of their desire ? " is remarkable . Further evidence of the fact that " Prostitutes " is pushing the limits of the speakable is the author 's means of self-identification ; like many contributors to The Woman Worker , " A Reader " prefers to remain anonymous . # Of course , the gender ambiguity of initials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courage " were actually authored by female readers . Indeed , the most frequent contributor of poetry to The Woman Worker was a man who did not belong to a local WLL--Robert Whitaker , the well-known British-American socialist , writer , and Baptist minister from La Crescenta , California . Unlike many of the contributions to The Woman Worker , Whitaker s work is signed with his full name and his place of residence . Only one of Whitaker s eight poems echoes the discourse of the " Rebel Woman " : like " Prostitutes , " " The First Stone " ( February 1929 ) employs a first-person , female speaker who condemns the hypocrisy of those male clerics and lawyers who " sell " their " brains " but condemn her work as illegal ( 8 ) . Almost all of Whitaker s other poems rely on male speakers and the figure of universal brotherhood in order to communicate a desire for worldwide socialism .

Indeed , the regular column " Our Labor Leagues at Work " never cites the writing of fiction and poetry as one of the regular undertakings of the local WLLs. # The " rebel woman , " despite her powerful presence in The Woman Worker , was not alone . The most immediate evidence of this fact is the cover image , which first appeared on the July-August 1928 issue . Although Custance obviously preferred the " rebel woman , " she chose WLL member Aileen Hautamakis considerably tamer submission , which features a short-haired woman holding a book--symbolizing " KNOWLEDGE " --in her right hand , and a flaming torch--representative of " ENLIGHTENMENT " --in her left hand ( " Readers-Please Take Notice " 10 ) . This woman is reminiscent of the ancient figure of " Lady Justice , " who is often depicted holding a sword in her right hand and the scales of justice in her left . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far cry from her gun-toting counterpart . Custances compromise speaks to her desire to communicate with a broad spectrum of women-it is significant that the upheld book is not identified--as well as her intention to stay within the limits of legality . This tamer icon of womanhood was accompanied within the pages of the periodical by the " little woman " --a figure who constantly shadows her rebellious counterpart . The epithet comes from A. D. A. 's story " Modern Values Struggle " ( December 1926 ) , which follows the travails of a " little woman " a " poor little victim " of child labour who moves from the factories of England to an unnamed Canadian city where the prospects for a young , working-class family are dim indeed . The figure of the " little woman " is consistent in The Woman Worker : as in this story , she is hardworking , morally respectable , and thrifty but physically exhausted from excessive--often waged--labour . Indeed , her entry into waged labour is invariably the catalyst for greater troubles ; the waged work of married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful to family life and " an unfortunate burden , not a right " ( Hobbs and Sangster 39 ) . In keeping with this message regarding the need to safeguard women as mothers or as potential mothers , the final page of each issue of The Woman Worker ( until June 1928 ) announces the periodicals commitment to the " protection of womanhood , " the " care of motherhood , " and " co-operation in place of competition . " # While the " Rebel Woman " is prominent in the poetry published in The Woman Worker , the " little woman " more often finds her home in its short fiction . As was the case with the poetry of protest in the 1920s , leftist writers of short fiction in Canada , lacking access to cultural debates from Soviet Russia , tended to look to nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century US-American and British models for inspiration ( Doyle 63-64 ) . The variegated strains of the nineteenth-century , Anglo-American print culture of social reform exercised considerable influence on contributors to The Woman Worker . Narratives of reform were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries and had the added advantage of already being associated with women 's writing , even if they were likely tainted , in the eyes of some WLLers , by their frequently overt Christian mission . In their portrayal of endangered working women , many of the stories in The Woman Worker owe a debt to narratives of social reform such as Harold Begbie 's A London Girl ( 1925 ) , which was positively reviewed in the second issue ( August 1926 ) as a novel that encourages the reader to revile " those who set themselves to destroy the lives and beautiful bodies of young girls " ( 10 ) . Other stories , such as the anonymously authored " The Story of Ellen Kenealey ( A True Story from Life ) " ( July 1926 ) , depend on the didactic melodrama of some reform narratives in order to lend urgency and appeal to their messages concerning the dangers of working life for women in cities . In " The Story of Ellen Kenealey , " the eponymous protagonist is out of work , unmarried , aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via an internally focalized narrator : " Who was there to give her shelter or assistance when her last cent was gone ? No one . What would she be in the eyes of the law ? A vagrant " ( i2 ) . Desperate , Ellen commits suicide by swallowing carbolic acid . # Yet the short fiction published in The Woman Worker was not all sensational formula and didactic narrative intervention : in their daring foray into social realism and analyses of structural ills , they are striking examples of the realist fiction that was beginning to emerge in 1920s Canada . Contributors of short stories were , like Jessie Georgina Sime , writing a new Canadian fiction of working-class women 's urban experiences . As Carole Gerson contends , these experiences were , with a few exceptions , invisible in Canadian writing prior to the First World War ( A Purer Taste 140 ) . Much earlier than in Canada , according to Amanda Claybaugh , British and US-American reform narratives expanded the domain of artistic representation to include such previously invisible experiences , places , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons , factories , slums , and madhouses ; prostitutes , laborers , servants , and slaves " ( 6 ) . Such a widened view was clearly valued by contributors to The Woman Worker . A. D. A. , for example , lauds Elizabeth Gaskell 's Mary Barton ( 1848 ) in the April 1927 issue for its realistic portrayal of the " lives of industrial workers " ( " Mary Barton " 10 ) . A Victorian novel of social reform with a decidedly nineteenth-century interventionist narrative style , Mary Barton is also a pioneering example of realism for its topographical accuracy ; its evocation of the texture of daily , working-class life ; and its attention to the " regional specificity " of the Lancashire dialect ( Foster xii ) . A comparable realism that employs Canadian settings and idiomatic language appears in The Woman Worker in stories such as " A Price for Bread " ( February 1927 ) , " Something Wrong Somewhere " ( March 1927 ) , " The Spectre Named--Poverty " ( May 1928 ) , and " Compliments of the Season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials of working-class women without heavy-handed intervention from the narrator and without resorting to the improbable , sensational , or idealistic resolutions typical of the romance tendencies of many nineteenth-century reform narratives , particularly as these flowed from the pens of Canadian women writers such as Agnes Maule Machar.13 # Often the stories in The Women Worker are detached narrations of the everyday troubles of working women ; at other times , recalling the intrusive narrative didacticism of the earlier novel of reform , the narrators are distinctly interventionist , appraising structural problems underlying workplace misery , offering direct political commentary on the injustices the stories depict , and calling for legislative change . However , the didactic stories in The Woman Worker reject the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century emphasis on noblesse oblige and voluntary middle-class benevolence that is so often at the centre of what Claybaugh calls " one of the most common scenes in reformist writing : the investigative visit " ( 7 ) .14 For example , despite its invocation of the suffering " little woman , " A. D. A. 's " Modern Values Struggle " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reform narratives that precede it , call in a middle-class savior ; instead , the protagonist abandons her ungrateful family for work on a western farm and a relationship of " comradeship " with one of the farm 's male labourers . More commonly , the stories supplant the resolution proffered by a benevolent employer with calls for an active , interventionist state . In A. D. A. 's short story " The Shack Builder " ( September 1926 ) , a working-class housewife , Mary , is left without any means of support when her husband unexpectedly dies and she is denied Mothers ' Allowance because of her ownership of a meagre " shack . " The same authors " A Modern Virgin " ( January 1927 ) is a story that warns the reader of the sexual danger inherent in domestic work and advocates legislative solutions to the predatory tendencies of male employers . A. D. A. 's contributions to " Shop and Factory Life , " a column that contained " true tales " from the world of waged work , similarly promote government and legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1927 column , for example , the author tells the story of " Esther , " a recent Polish immigrant whose employers systematically underpay her . A. D. A. helps Esther file a complaint at the Minimum Wage Board and , although the author recognizes that unionization is a surer means of protection , she shows readers how to navigate the legal bodies that are ostensibly meant to guarantee certain standards in the workplace ( " Shop and Factory Life " 5-7 ) . It is in such advocacy of protective measures that one finds The Woman Worker engaged in the project of beckoning forth a strong welfare state.15 # In some cases , contributors of prose merged the " little woman " with her more militant counterpart , and stories like this are powerful demonstrations of the competing ideologies that shaped The Woman Worker . A. D. A. 's " We Visit the Mountain " ( October 1926 ) offers an account of a woman ( the first-person narrator ) canvassing her neighbourhood in Ontario on behalf of a labour candidate . After encountering various disappointing types , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel woman " ( 9-10 ) . This " rebel " immediately declares that , unlike those who precede her , she will cast her vote for " the man who can help the workers " ( 10 ) . She finishes her denunciation of capitalist oppression with a flourish : # In Russia the workers were compelled to take drastic action . I tell you , that is what will happen in Canada one of these days , and it may not be so very far off . Do not misunderstand me . I love Canada . I am not unpatriotic . I have heard that you people in the Labor Movement want to destroy our country , that you have no use for it . ( 10-11 ) # The narrator receives this speech with enthusiasm ; this " real rebel , " she affirms , " was figuring things out pretty correctly " ( 11 ) . The narrator then hastens to offer one correction : " we in the Labor Movement liked Canada so much that we wanted Canada for the only useful people , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities " ( 11 ) . Other elements in the story echo this apparent coexistence of the discourses of revolutionary socialism and parliamentary legality : while the narrator champions the " courageous " Agnes Macphail ( Canada 's first woman MP and a member of the Progressive Party ) , she concludes with a militant apostrophe that urges women readers to remove " the chains of bondage " and to turn their " mountain of ignorance " into a " seething volcano of working class activity and consciousness " ( 11 ) . " We Visit the Mountain " thus merges the periodical 's familiar language of state protection with a didactic call for class struggle that anticipates the politics and aesthetics of the socialist realism thats emerged out of Soviet Russia in the early 1930s. # It is important to emphasize that the protective legislation and social welfare measures advocated through the " little woman " were treated in the pages of The Woman Worker as short-term compromises that would precede the working-class rule gestured to in the figure of the " Rebel Woman . " Yet understanding CPC-affiliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions rather than as contributors to a discourse of state reform that was ultimately absorbed in the postwar " passive revolution " does these groups and their political and cultural labours a historical disservice.16 Feminist literary and labour historians in Canada have for several decades emphasized the contributions of white , middle-class women to late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century discourses of reform17 ; less well-known is the fact that ostensibly radical women 's groups in this same period were employing literary discourse drawn from a diverse leftist-progressive spectrum as a means of articulating ideas that ultimately influenced welfare-state thinking . In so doing , these women were also rewriting the fin de sicle narrative of noblesse oblige and attempting to write the new forms of realism that so dramatically altered Canadian fiction in the modern period . Moreover , this analysis of the cultural material in The Woman Worker offers evidence of the fact that equal-rights feminism did , albeit hesitantly , find articulation in interwar Canada ; inspired by examples of women 's emancipation in post-revolutionary Russia that were trickling into the Canadian Communist press in this period , creative contributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their dependence on masculinist traditions of workers ' poetry made this undertaking a fraught one . Lacking ideological and ethnic homogeneity and struggling to assert a message rooted in class and gender identification , the diverse women of Canada 's WLLs nonetheless left a significant creative print culture of dissent that reminds us of the politically eclectic heritage of the welfare state , the convoluted emergence of women 's leftist writing via nineteenth-century forms , and of the contested nature of the " woman question " in 1920s Canada . # NOTES 1 This article cites the extant copy of The Woman Worker that is housed at the National Library in Ottawa . Margaret Hobbs ' and Joan Sangster s study of The Woman Worker , which reprints the first issue of the periodical in its entirety , may be downloaded from the website of Athabasca University Press . # 2 Prior to the " crisis " between 1928 and 1931 in the CPC , which was provoked by the Trotskyist-Stalinist split , the party pursued open collaboration with diverse elements of the labour movement , even the conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # 3 The role of the political left , particularly social democrats , vis--vis the development of the welfare state has been well documented , but the ways in which leftist organizations employed periodicals as a means of calling the welfare state into being require further examination . This is especially true of Communist periodicals because CPC organizations have not often been considered in relation to the history of the welfare state or of social democracy in Canada ( McKay 74 ) . # 4 For the work of literary critics , see , for example : Doyle , Irr , Irvine , Rifkind , and Rimstead. # 5 The CPC initially operated through a legal front , the Workers Party of Canada , but , as the result of a Comintern directive in 1924 , began identifying itself as the Communist Party of Canada ( Angus 91-102 ) . # 6 For further discussion of the circumstances motivating the formation of the periodical , see Hobbs and Sangster , 7-13 .

Custance 's " Important Notice " in the January 1929 issue indicates that she was editing once again in the new year ( 14 ) , but this was short-lived : the last issue of the periodical appeared in April of 1929 , and Custance died in July of that same year ( Hobbs and Sangster 12 ) . # 7 In the first issue , Custance relates that The Woman Worker first existed as a " feeble " mimeographed publication ; she is clearly proud of the professionally printed magazine that appeared in 1926 ( " Success " 32 ) . The first issue boasts a dark green cover of cardstock with black type ; all subsequent issues bear a lighter green cover of thinner , slightly glossier paper . # 8 See Mary Norths letter in the October 1926 issue .

See , for one example among many : Beatrice Green , " Women 's Freedom in Soviet Russia " ( January 1927 ) . # 10 In referring to the laws that controlled the content of printed matter that circulated through the post , Custance is alluding to regulations that imposed real limits on the expression of socialist thought in this period . In the April 1927 " Notes and Happenings " section , Custance decries the fact that the Customs Department had banned the importation of the socialist periodical New Masses from the United States ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take the concept of " revolutionary chorus " from Cary Nelsons study of the poetry of the US-American left , Revolutionary Memory . # 12 Joussaye is perhaps best known for her poem " Only a Working Girl , " which appeared in her first book The Songs That Quinte Sang ( 1895 ) .

He cuts away the blue plastic bag that covers the bunch to minimize insect damage and increase yields . Then he pulls off five light-yellow bananas -- four for his visitors and one for himself . <p> We are standing in what seems like a banana tree forest , dried leaves crunching under our feet , thankful for the shade under the foot-wide banana plant leaves in the 90 degrees F air . The ground is dry , except where water has trickled from drip irrigation tubes , creating slippery puddles of mud . <p> It seems like a strange place to eat a banana ; the morning breakfast table is a more familiar setting . But here we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to each other with orange twine to keep them from collapsing under their own weight . Here and there , a tree has toppled over nonetheless . <p> We each peel our bananas and take a bite as Soler awaits our opinion . The fruit is soft , sweet , and warm -- the same temperature as the tropical air . We nod our approval . <p> " All my life I 've been farming . I love it , " Soler says , standing amid his 100 acres of fruits and vegetables , an agricultural oasis in an otherwise brown landscape . <p> In this semiarid south coast region , the average rainfall is only 30 to 35 inches a year -- about half the average for Puerto Rico as a whole . Most of the rain in this area falls during a 3-month period from August through October . Now it is early June and the rain-fed riverbeds are dry . <p> That Soler and other farmers in Puerto Rico can grow a profitable crop in this dry region is largely due to their own hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to the man standing next to him . " Any problem I have , I call him and he helps me , " says Soler of Heber Irizarry , an Agricultural Research Service horticulturist . <p> Irizarry points to the rows of Soler 's Grande Naine banana plants , which he and his colleagues in Puerto Rico introduced from Honduras in 1982 . " You can see the uniformity of the bunches . It looks like a factory . " <p> On this day we are seeing some of the best of Puerto Rico 's food " factory , " whose production has been driven by people like Irizarry and his colleagues at ARS ' Tropical Agriculture Research Station in Mayaguez . <p> Since 1902 , scientists there have been providing a research foundation for tropical agriculture , helping farmers more effectively grow bananas , plantains , sweetpotatoes , yams , cassava , beans , grain sorghum , and other foods , such as tanier , or taro root . <p> They have introduced or developed improved varieties of these crops and have initiated and promoted efficient farming practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bagging , and the management of banana plant shoots , called ratoons , that give growers an additional crop without replanting . <p> Scientists at the station have packaged these practices so that farmers like Mario Soler can produce a profitable crop . <p> " We try to give the farmer a crop and a system by which to grow it , " explains station director Antonio Sotomayor-Rios . <p> Grande Naine is one of these success stories . In dry areas like the one where Soler farms , drip-irrigated Grande Naine plants can yield 56 metric tons of bananas per hectare ( about 25 tons per acre ) . Growers are paid from $4.50 to $6.50 for a 40-pound box of high-quality bananas -- meaning an acre could yield up to 1,250 boxes , or from $5,625 to $8,255 in gross revenue . <p> " There 's no doubt that if they manage their crop carefully and irrigate , they can make a profit , even with the cost of installing a drip irrigation system , " Irizarry says . Plantains -- A Major Crop <p> We are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sotomayor-Rios and agronomist Francisco " Paco " Vazquez , who leads the station 's germ-plasm project . In Puerto Rico , plantains are the second most important crop after coffee , with a farmgate value of just under $44 million . <p> Plantain fruits look like large bananas , but the pulp is not as soft . Green or ripe plantains can be fried , baked , or boiled , providing people on the island and other areas of the Tropics with a valuable source of carbohydrates and minerals . <p> A plantain called Maricongo accounts for about 90 percent of the crop grown in Puerto Rico . Although a high-quality plantain , Maricongo has inconsistent yields . By late 1995 , Irizarry plans to release Superplatano , a plantain that -- if managed properly -- can have at least a 20 percent higher yield than Maricongo . <p> " Superplatano has great potential for export markets because its yields are consistent , and the size of the fruit is uniform if some of the lower hands of the bunch are pruned , " he says . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ripens like a banana . " <p> We see our first fruiting Superplatano plants at Modesto Canabal 's farm near Yauco in the southwestern region of the island . Most of the area , once in sugarcane , is now covered with bananas and plantains . Canabal is the first farmer on the island to grow Superplatano in test plantings . He is now harvesting fruit on 3 acres . And in early 1995 , he plans to harvest an additional 12 acres that are under drip irrigation . <p> Irizarry believes the station 's plantain research has been instrumental in increasing crop yields in Puerto Rico from 20,000 fruits per acre in the early 1970 's to more than 40,000 today . <p> " In the 1970 's , we pioneered the use of clonal selection in plantains and proposed techniques to overcome the problem of yield instability , " he says . " From this program we released five superior clones after testing them all over the island , and these had an immediate impact on increasing yields and fruit quality . " <p> Another plantain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn weevil , a major banana and plantain pest . <p> We reach the lab 's farm at Isabela and board a pickup truck that takes us into a field where workers are digging up sweetpotatoes . There are several piles of roots on top of the soil . Their colors range from cream to dark purple . " The purple variety , called Viola , averaged 38 metric tons per hectare ( 17 per acre ) after 135 days in the field -- a higher yield than any other sweetpotato tested -- before it was released in 1990 , " says station agronomist Edmundo Rivera . <p> Next to Viola is a pile of the cream-colored variety called Ivoire . <p> This is the final field trial of Ivoire before its release in 1995 . Rivera says that aside from its high yield -- comparable to Viola 's -- Ivoire has an unusual quality for a sweetpotato : It is n't sweet . It is suitable for anyone who does n't like the sweetness of a sweetpotato but wants a good source of fiber and carbohydrates . <p> Nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a backyard gardener would grow pole beans . Yams are tuberous vegetables , and the poles provide support for the heavy plant vines . But the trellises are also an added expense for farmers . <p> " Yams are usually grown on trellises in raised beds -- meaning higher labor and materials costs , " Vazquez says . " But our field experiments show that we can get 60 metric tons per hectare ( 27 per acre ) on hilly land without trellises , " he says . <p> Sotomayor-Rios says that " yams offer perhaps the greatest potential to offset food shortages in the Tropics , because some cultivars can be grown with no fertilizer . " The station now has 24 yam cultivars from Southeast Asia , including two outstanding ones -- Binugas and Gunung -- that have high yields and resistance to leaf spot diseases , soil nematodes , and the tuber weevil . <p> Two tropical root crops , cassava and tanier , have also gotten a boost from ARS research at Mayaguez .

Three varieties that average 28 metric tons per hectare ( 12 per acre ) without fertilizer are slated for release in 1995 . <p> Tanier production is often plagued by disease , poor management , and other problems , according to plant physiologist Ricardo Goenaga . By properly managing soil , fertilizer , and drip irrigation , he says , growers can get 40 metric tons per hectare ( 18 per acre ) . One grower using Goenaga 's methods is Carlos Hernandez , who planted 30 acres of tanier on his farm in Santa Isabel . Goenaga says growers like Hernandez can have a gross income of about $10,000 an acre using these production methods . <p> Other crops that have benefited from ARS research at the Mayaguez station are : <p> -- Sorghum . One recent variety of forage sorghum released by the station is called Millo Blanco . It will grow up to 12 feet high and produce about 7 metric tons per hectare ( 3 per acre ) of high-quality dry forage over a 2-month period . This is twice the yield of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing during both short and long days . <p> In cooperation with Texas A &M; University , station researchers have released 533 converted sorghum lines through the Sorghum Conversion Program . Through breeding , researchers convert plants that are sensitive to day length into ones that produce high yields , even when shorter winter days mean less light . Beans . More than 40 dry edible bean lines have been released from the Mayaguez station , making a major impact on bean production in the Tropics , says Phillip Miklas , a plant geneticist . One variety , Arroyo-Loro , is the leading bean grown in Puerto Rico . It is also a parent of Mayflower , which is grown on about 80,000 acres in Michigan alone . Miklas is now using genetic marker technology to transfer disease-resistance genes in bean germplasm . Cacao . In a cooperative project with the American Cacao Research Institute , Irizarry is evaluating 40 grafted clones selected from 5 hybrid families . The initial goal is to obtain a three-to four-fold increase in yields . He says it may be possible to intercrop cacao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young cacao plants , providing temporary shade for them and additional revenue for the farmer . Tropical fruit . Jackfruit , mangosteen , mango , avocado , lychee , mamey sapote , and carambola are some of the tropical fruits that Vazquez says have potential as alternative crops in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the Tropics . One of the most promising of these fruits , mangosteen , is known as " the most delicious fruit in the Tropics , " but can take from 8 to 15 years to bear fruit . Scientists at the station developed a way to graft it onto rootstock , allowing the tree to produce fruit within 3 to 5 years . <p> Antonio Sotomayor-Rios , Heber Irizarry , Edmundo Rivera , Ricardo Goenaga , Francisco Vazquez , and Phillip Miklas are at the USDA-ARS Tropical Agriculture Research Station , P.O.

@@4017841 Engineering technology gets more work in the operating room . <p> The puzzles that engineers and doctors face have much in common . The human body , after all , can be thought of as an engineered system . Blood flowing through the body , for instance , mirrors airflow through an engine . It 's natural then , that medical researchers should appropriate for their own purposes engineering analysis technology originally developed to predict the flow of fluids through engines or of water around bridge stanchions . As these technologies find a home in hospitals and doctors ' offices , they 'll change the way surgeons assess patients ' conditions and operate . Analysis software lets surgeons plan an operation , by mapping it specifically to the patient 's body . Doctors will predict how a patient will respond to a medical implant and plot implantation accordingly , say researchers who work to configure engineering technologies for medical use . A Cultural Coming Together <p> David Gosman - professor of computational fluid dynamics at Imperial College of Science , Technology , and Medicine in London - uses computational fluid dynamics to study blood flow . He says engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But my impression is that it 's still the early days , " he said . " CFD is relatively new , so it 'll take a while to become known and appreciated . <p> " We need more research to fully understand what simulations can offer and how to use that information , " he added . " And the tool needs to be put into an easy-to-use form so that it can be routinely applied to cardiovascular studies without the need for CFD specialists . " <p> Of course , before technology used and developed by engineers can shift to the medical world , the separate cultures need to find a common point of departure . <p> The medical researchers , often engineers themselves , have to understand how doctors work and how they 'd accept using a computer as a tool in the operating room . But in the subtle world of medical problem solving , doctors also have to accept that the cold , hard numbers that drive the computational methods behind analysis software do provide answers . <p> " A fascinating , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results when the two fields must by necessity work together to develop medical equipment or methods , " Gosman said . <p> Professionals in the two fields use different terminology and approach measurement and simulation from different angles . <p> " We found the different jargons initially to be a real barrier , but this was gradually overcome with give and take on both sides , " Gosman said . <p> Still , for many doctors , computers and surgery just do n't mix , said Anthony Petrella , manager of the computational biomechanics group at DePuy Orthopaedics Inc. of Warsaw , Ind . The company makes almost every type of replacement joint . <p> Medical researchers at DePuy are working to repurpose CAE software with an eye toward visualizing and analyzing the . human body . Petrella said the company wants to use analysis software to improve joint replacement surgery . Doctors would use the software to predict how a patient 's new joint will likely wear and how tissue will respond to the artificial joint . Guided by those predictions , they can position the joint to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Joint replacement has become almost routine . Many U.S. surgeons perform joint replacement operations . For some , that 's almost all they do . Therefore they have little time to incorporate a new system into their daily routines . <p> " Surgeons are skeptical of computational methods , " Petrella said . " Still , new doctors today are tech savvy . They played computer games as kids . " <p> Computer-assisted surgeries , in which doctors get real-time information about their patients as they operate , are becoming more common , but computers still are n't usual operating room tools . Many surgeons do n't feel comfortable using them , Petrella said . He spoke in May at a user conference sponsored by Ansys in its home town of Pittsburgh . DePuy 's research uses Ansys software for analysis . <p> A medical tool of today could be used in the operating room to capture information about the patient 's condition and feed it to a computer . According to Petrella , fluoroscopy - essentially a moving X-ray of a patient 's joint - can visualize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis for the computer model to predict how the joint would wear over time and how surrounding tissue might react to the synthetic material . <p> Researchers can calculate when and how a patient 's artificial joint will wear . But creating a model to predict how tissue will respond to the new joint is a different ball game entirely , Petrella said . Healthy tissue can respond any number of ways to the implant . It might become stiff or change shape over time . Analysis codes are hard to write for that type of intangible . <p> Still , Petrella and his fellow researchers say a computer program is within reach that will feed surgeons information unique to each patient . Help For a Weak Heart <p> David Gosman and his team at Imperial College are adapting technology originally developed to simulate airflow through a reciprocating internal combustion engine so that it can be applied to study the human heart . <p> CFD is most commonly used now to plan heart-bypass surgery . Surgeons simulate blood flow through the heart via CFD then program their findings into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gosman 's research , on the other hand , aims to simulate how a weak heart muscle affects blood flow . The simulations would help researchers improve pacemakers and artificial heart valves . <p> " Doctors have been interested for some time in knowing about blood-flow behavior in the heart and how it differs between healthy patients and those suffering from heart illnesses , " Gosman said . <p> Little is known about the effects of heart irregularities on the flow , Gosman said . <p> " And there 's even less understanding of how pacemakers can be designed to control the heart motion in a way to restore the healthy pattern , " he added . " What kind of motion is necessary to achieve that ? " <p> Though CFD has already been used extensively to study artificial valves , little research has been done to evaluate how they affect blood flow when actually placed in a patient , Gosman said . His simulations will look at that . <p> Measurement techniques like magnetic resonance imaging give doctors information about patient blood flow and offer them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or artificial heart valve , but MRIs do n't return the level of detail that CFD simulations depict , Gosman said . His approach combines MRIs with CFD simulation . <p> The information obtained by an MRI is in the form of a thin , two-dimensional image slice . Gosman and his team take MRIs at varied parts of a ventricle as it fills with and empties of blood . The images combine to show how the chamber looks during the entire cycle . <p> That image is then modeled with CFD . For modeling , the team uses Star-CD software from CD-adapco of New York . Gosman is also director and vice president of technology of CD-adapco . <p> With the model , doctors can predict how blood flow would change if a pacemaker or artificial valve were placed in the heart . It also lets doctors look at what-if scenarios that they ca n't run on the real subjects . <p> At first , the simulations would be used to help diagnose patients , and Gosman hopes that doctors eventually will study a particular patient 's CFD simulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta are also studying blood flow . They have an eye toward using the information to design better artificial heart valves . <p> Numerical modeling techniques originally developed by the institute to simulate how water flows around hydraulic structures like bridge foundations is finding a second use in helping researchers better understand blood flow patterns through artificial mechanical heart valves . <p> The research could yield the most accurate depiction yet of the turbulent environment that blood cells and platelets encounter as they pass through the mechanical heart valve , said Fotis Sotiropoulos , an associate professor in the schools of civil and environmental engineering and mechanical engineering . He 's researching the system along with Ajit Yoganathan , who directs Georgia Tech 's cardiovascular fluid mechanics laboratory . <p> Doctors replace poorly functioning natural-heart valves with prosthetic valves . But present-day designs are far from ideal . <p> They can destroy blood platelets or permit a particle that has broken away from a blood clot to block a blood vessel . These complications likely come about because the blood is exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical prosthesis , Sotiropoulos said . <p> Doctors also think the complex blood flow patterns around the valve may trigger a cellular response that can lead to the onset of heart diseases . <p> But before the artificial valves can be redesigned , researchers need an in-depth understanding of the flow fields that the valves induce . <p> To date , the fluid mechanics of heart valves has been largely studied by way of experiments , Sotiropoulos said . His research is an attempt to apply both CFD and experimentation to the problem . <p> Cardiovascular flows generally pose unique challenges to even the most advanced CFD tools available today . The interaction between blood motion and compliant vascular walls leads to a very complex fluid-structure problem , he said . <p> Yet Sotiropoulos believes that CFD is developed well enough today to tackle the problem . " Computational resources and especially the advent of massively parallel clusters in the past decade have made it feasible to attempt such complex computations in very demanding simulations , " he said . ( Massively parallel clusters assemble many conventional CPUs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large problem . ) <p> Still , his team relies on the results of physical experiments to prove the accuracy of their CFD simulations . An in vitro experiment can use an anatomically realistic model of the human heart , through which researchers can pump blood . They can compare results against those of a CFD model . In vivo information is also available in the MRIs of patients . <p> " Experiments have to accompany CFD modeling to provide it with the credibility medical practitioners need to be convinced they can rely on such modeling tools to make decisions that could ultimately affect the span and quality of the life of the patient , " Sotiropoulos said . <p> The Georgia Tech team ultimately wants their tools to be used in what they call virtual surgery . Doctors would model a patient 's heart and blood flow to plan the best way to operate - before any incision is made . <p> Manufacturers of heart valves can also use the CFD method to optimize their designs to minimize hazards to blood elements . <p> Along with the exciting opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't become colorful science fiction , but remains grounded to the physical reality it 's intended to simulate , Sotiropoulos added . Advances in other medical technologies make that likely . <p> A major difficulty in applying CFD to cardiovascular flows stemmed from medical researchers ' lack of understanding about the exact geometry of the various blood vessels that serve as the basis for a CFD model . Nowadays , major advances in MRI techniques have improved the accuracy of models of blood vessels . <p> " The availability of anatomically realistic geometries has opened new horizons for CFD and paved the way for CFD to make a major mark in the field of biomedical engineering , " Sotiropoulos said . <p> " The term virtual surgery no longer sounds like catchy phrases from a science-fiction novel ; it 's going to become reality in the coming decades , " he said . <p> " Doctors would use analysis a new joint will wear and software to predict how how tissue will respond to it " <p> " Research could yield the of the turbulence around most accurate depiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the basis of models that can guide surgeons through the unique fluid dynamics of each patient . <p> to study the effects of circulatory flow on the walls of the aortic arch , above , or to observe in detail a ventricle in the process of pumping blood . <p> By Jean Thilmany <p> 
@@4014941 Section : Science and practice <p> Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection is a global challenge , there being an estimated 300 million chronic carriers worldwide. ( n1 ) <p> Physicians faced with a clinical suspicion of hepatitis B and those wishing to exclude HBV infection in blood donors or to determine susceptibility to such infection or to monitor responses to vaccination send samples of blood to the laboratory . Table l lists some of the tests likely to be done there and the viral elements that these assays exploit . The serological tests will be familiar , those based on molecular biology less so , but neither the clinical significance of the commercial assays for HBV serology nor more recent developments such as the branched-chain DNA assay for HBV DNA can be understood without delving deeply into the structure and organisation of the HBV genome . And the same applies to our comprehension of hepatitis B vaccines , the pathogenesis of HBV infection , the mechanism of HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis , and current and future approaches to treatment . Structure of HBV genome <p> HBV , a hepadnavirus , is the smallest DNA virus known , having only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is partly double-stranded circular DNA . One strand known as " minus " is almost a complete circle and contains overlapping genes that encode both structural proteins ( pre-S , surface , core ) and replicative proteins ( polymerase , X ) ( figure . 1 ) . The other strand ( " plus " ) is short and variable in length . <p> Two enhancer elements have been identified . ENH I is tissue specific and functions efficiently only in hepatocytes . Binding proteins and liver-specific factors bind to it , and ENH I also has a retinoic-acid-responsive element , suggesting a role for retinoic acid in the liver-specific regulation of HBV gene expression . ENH II stimulates the transcriptional activity of the surface gene promoters . Other elements are summarised in the legend to figure 1 . The most conserved area is a 62 nucleotide domain in the pre-core/core region which shares considerable homology with a domain ( U5 ) in certain retroviruses , suggesting a common evolutionary origin. ( n3 ) Transcription and translation ( table 2 ) <p> Four mRNA transcripts of known function have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template both for genome replication and for the expression of pre-core/core and polymerase proteins . A 2.4 kb transcript encodes for pre-S1 , pre-S2 , and HBsAg while a 2.1 kb transcript encodes only for pre-S2 and HBsAg . The smallest transcript ( 0.7 kb ) encodes the X protein . <p> The core gene , which has a pre-core region , encodes for both core antigen ( HBcAg ) and a cleavage product , e antigen ( HBeAg ) . When pre-core is transcribed , HBcAg is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is cleaved and HBeAg is secreted. ( n4 , n5 ) HBcAg is important for viral packaging and is an integral part of the core particle of the whole virus . Even though the pre-core sequence is not essential for replication , HBeAg is a good marker of active HBV replication because the pre-core/core gene product is generated from the template that is also used for replication . <p> The surface/pre-S gene encodes for the virus envelope . Pre-S seems to be important for the attachment of HBV to hepatocytes . In vitro , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pre-S2. ( n6 ) The S1 site and one pre-S2 site can bind directly to a hepatoblastoma cell line . Pre-S1 also binds to liver plasma membrane yet it is not liver specific , for it also binds to mononuclear cells . HBV has been detected in mononuclear cells but it is not actively replicating , indicating another post-infection tissue-specific mechanism , such as ENH I. The other pre-S2 site also binds to albumin , suggesting an alternative way of viral entry . <p> In transgenic mice and in cell culture models , intracellular accumulation of pre-S1 inhibits secretion of HBsAg ( n7 , n8 ) but the role of the pre-S1/HBsAg ratio in the export of HBsAg in man remains to be established . Viral replication <p> Our understanding of hepadnavirus replication is largely derived from animal models . There are three characteristics . First , the DNA strands are synthesised ; the minus strand must be completed before synthesis of the other strand can proceed . Second , the virus polymerase also functions as a reverse transcriptase . Finally , minus strand is primed by terminal protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plus is by an oligoribonucleotide derived from viral genomic RNA . <p> HBV binds to the cell surface and penetrates the cell ( figure 2 ) . The virus core is thought to be transported to the nucleus without processing . The relaxed circular virus DNA is then converted to a covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) which seems to function as the template for viral RNA synthesis . Integration of HBV DNA into the host genome does not occur during the normal course of replication , as it does with retroviruses . Transcription yields RNA of various sizes . The 3 5 kb genomic RNA serves as a template for reverse transcription . Minus strand DNA synthesis initiates at the 3 ' DRI with the terminal protein of the polymerase as a primer and , as synthesis progresses , the RNA template is simultaneously degraded by RNaseH ( figure 3 ) . Plus strand DNA synthesis initiates at the 3 ' end of DR2 and synthesis continues until the terminal protein at the 5 ' end of the minus strand is passed ( figure 3 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mature HBV . Since most HBV particles contain open DNA circles with incomplete plus strands it has been postulated that the virus polymerase is somehow constrained at this point . The mature core particles are then packed into the HBsAg/pre-S in the endoplasmic reticulum and exported from the cell . A stable pool of cccDNA molecules is maintained in the nuclei by transporting the newly synthesised HBV DNA back into the nucleus . Because HBsAg can inhibit the formation of cccDNA , this may represent a negative feedback to HBV replication. ( n10 ) <p> Clinical relevance <p> The variable region between the core and surface gene has been used to study transmission of HBV . For example , DNA fingerprinting can reveal the route of transmission of the virus in families even in HBV endemic areas. ( n11 ) <p> 3% or so of babies born to HBsAg positive mothers and receiving both active and passive immunoprophylaxis at birth , will still become seropositive for HBsAg . Among the subtypes of HBV , the " a " determinant of HBsAg remains constant and the vaccine promotes antibodies against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination have an " escape mutant " of HBV lacking " a " . ( n12 ) In this mutant just one aminoacid ( an arginine ) is replaced by another ( glycine ) . This important finding confirms the need for seroepidemiological follow-up of vaccinees and for new vaccines with other protective epitopes such as pre-S1 , which has a role in viral binding to hepatocytes . <p> The commonest HBV mutation is in the pre-core region where a genomic instruction to stop translation of an mRNA to protein prevents production of HBeAg. ( n13 , n14 ) These patients have HBV DNA in their serum but have antibody to e , and most of them have active liver disease . This mutant has also been associated with fulminant hepatitis B. ( n15-n17 ) However , the hepatitis in babies who acquire this pre-core mutant from their mothers resolves promptly , so this mutant is not always associated with severe disease . Because the pre-core mutant takes many years to emerge from the " wild type " HBV , both wild type and pre-core mutant may well be transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably selected by the host 's immune response and exogenous factors , including interferon-a ( IFN Alpha ) therapy . <p> Variations of the mid-core region of the HBV genome have been reported to be associated with the development of active liver disease in chronic HBV infection in Japan , ( n18 ) but we have not seen this in US whites . <p> Tumour necrosis factor-Alpha ( TNF Alpha ) and IFN Alpha and Gamma inhibit the HBV core/genomic and pre-S 1 promoters in cell culture , but in patients with chronic HBV infection TNF Alpha had either no effect or increased the amount of circulating HBV and HBsAg. ( n19 ) IFN Gamma has little inhibitory effect on circulating HBV. ( n20 ) <p> The information on viral replication is important for drug design . So far , however , agents which inhibit DNA synthesis and reduce HBV replication , once they are withdrawn , are followed by HBV recurrence . The cccDNA molecules in the nuclei of hepatocytes seem to be very stable . Non-hepatic sites of virus replication , such as peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of viral persistence <p> Viral persistence is probably related to a specific failure of T cells to recognise HBV antigens . This assumption is supported by the clinical observation that patients with a relative deficit in T-cell function ( the young , the aged , and the immunosuppressed ) are more prone to develop chronic HBV infection . In-vitro peripheral blood T cell activation is impaired in patients with chronic HBV infection but this is not associated with clinical evidence of immune deficiency , suggesting a redistribution of primed T cells from the circulation to the liver . <p> The demonstration that IFN Alpha can eliminate active HBV replication raises the possibility that chronic HBV carriage may be secondary to IFN Alpha deficiency . IFN Alpha is rarely detected in the circulation in chronic hepatitis B and virus-stimulated production of IFN Alpha by circulating mononuclear cells is reduced. ( n21 ) Furthermore , the HBV core gene suppresses the IFN Beta gene in mouse fibroblasts. ( n22 ) Although these findings are attractive , HBV appears not to alter IFN Alpha production significantly in man . First , IFN Alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mononuclear cells and liver levels of this enzyme are higher in patients with acute HBV infection and in HBV carriers than they are in healthy controls , and patients with HBV-related chronic active hepatitis have normal levels. ( n23 ) Second , both IFN Alpha protein and mRNA detected in the liver . Although the hepatic expression of IFN Alpha is lower than that of acute HBV , those with active liver disease had higher hepatic expression of IFN Alpha , suggesting that suboptimal production of IFN Alpha by circulating mononuclear cells may be related to a redistribution of the " primed " cells to the liver . Alternatively , the production of IFN Alpha by circulating cells may have been down-regulated during its passage through the liver. ( n24 ) <p> HBV can also reduce the cell 's sensitivity to IFN Alpha . When a vector containing HBV was transfected into an IFN Alpha-sensitive cell line , the response to exogenous IFN Alpha was reduced. ( n25 ) Subsequently it was found that the terminal protein of the HBV polymerase inhibited the response to IFN ( and to double-stranded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential importance in relation to the mechanism of viral persistence . <p> The high incidence of chronic HBV carriage in babies born to HBeAg + mothers suggests that circulating e antigen in the mother induces immunotolerance in the baby . In newborn transgenic mice that produce HBeAg , both HBeAg and HBcAg are tolerant at the T-cell level. ( n27 ) These mice produce core but not e antibody . The maintenance of T-cell tolerance was broken only when HBeAg had been withdrawn for more than 16 weeks . The close resemblance in the chronology of immunological events in HBeAg-expressing transgenic mice and in human HBV infection suggests that one function of e antigen may be to induce immunotolerance in utero , favouring the persistence of HBV in infancy and childhood . Mechanism of hepatocellular damage <p> The existence of an HBV carrier state for many years without evidence of parenchymal liver damage suggests that HBV is not cytopathic in man and that an immune-mediated mechanism is operating . This assumption is supported by the absence of obvious disease in patients with impaired immune response ( Down 's syndrome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the predominant cell-type at the site of piecemeal necrosis is the CD8 + T lymphocyte ; and by the enhanced liver cell necrosis found when the immune system is stimulated by levamisole or by corticosteroid withdrawal . <p> What is the specific target for immune attack ? It is not easy to study the mechanism of hepatocellular injury in acute HBV infection . In one attempt 5 individuals in the early **25;1584;TOOLONG phase of acute HBV infection were identified by contact tracing and their cellular immune response to HBV antigens was monitored. ( n28 ) Cellular immunity to pre-S developed 30 days before biochemical evidence of liver damage appeared , at a stage when the HBsAg titre was rising and when HBeAg was first detectable . A cellular response to HBcAg followed 10 days later , preceding the humoral response ( anti-HBc IgM ) . The cellular response to HBsAg correlated most closely with the onset of biochemical liver damage , suggesting HBsAg as the likely immune target . On the other hand , cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) directed against HBcAg have been identified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies with overlapping synthetic peptides have delineated some of the HLA restricted T-cell epitopes ( eg , an HLA-A2 restricted epitope has been mapped to aminoacid residue 18-27 of HBcAg ( n29 ) ) and , recently , aminoacid residues 141-151 to both HLA-A31 and HLA-Aw 68 . <p> The search for the immune target in chronic HBV infection is just as difficult but hepatocytes expressing HBcAg have come under suspicion . In cytotoxicity experiments T cells lysed hepatocytes that expressed HBcAg , and this cytotoxicity could be blocked by antibody to HBcAg or by HLA class I molecules. ( n30 , n31 ) There is some evidence that anti-HBe can also block cytotoxicity . No response to HBsAg was demonstrated . Immunohistochemical studies showed that cytoplasmic expression of core , but not surface , correlates with disease activity. ( n32 , n33 ) As T cell epitopes are usually 8-10 aminoacids in length , cytoplasmic accumulation of HBcAg may allow proteolytic processing to produce T-cell epitopes that are presented in conjunction with HLA class I molecules . <p> Study of T-helper cells ( T h ) has identified three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of these partly overlaps the HLA-A2 restricted CTL epitope referred to above . These studies indicate that HBcAg can be a stimulus for both helper and cytotoxic T cells . <p> Non-T- lymphocytes also seem to take part in the mediation of hepatocellular damage in chronic infection . Non-T-cell cytotoxicity can be blocked by liver-specific membrane lipoprotein ( LSP ) , aggregated IgG , or the F ( ab ' ) 2 fragment of anti-human IgG , suggesting that non-T lymphocytes may direct an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against a component of LSP. ( n35 ) <p> Cytokines are also likely to be involved. ( n36 ) In patients with HBV-related active liver disease , IFN Alpha is produced locally in the liver , and production of interleukin-1 and TNF Alpha by peripheral blood mononuclear cells are also increased . The possibility that these are non-specific consequences of inflammation remains to be excluded . <p> Although the evidence strongly suggests that HBV causes hepatocellular damage through an immune-mediated mechanism , this may not be true in other models or clinical settings . High-level expression of HBsAg is associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and overexpression of HBcAg in hepatoblastoma line induces cytopathic changes. ( n38 ) In patients transplanted for chronic hepatitis B , recurrence of infection is associated with a novel histological pattern ( fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis ) and fulminant clinical course . HBV may be directly cytopathic in this situation. ( n39 ) <p> Clinical relevance <p> Theoretically , immunosuppressive therapy should alleviate hepatocellular damage induced by immune-mediated mechanisms . However , corticosteroids also have a direct stimulatory effect on viral replication and this may be associated with an increased antigen expression and greater spread through the liver . Upon corticosteroid withdrawal , the immune rebound , coupled with the enhanced viral antigen ( immune target ) expression , may result in severe , even fulminant reactivation. ( n40 , n41 ) Rapid reintroduction of corticosteroids followed by gradual withdrawal may alleviate the severe life-threatening reactivation. ( n42 ) <p> The identification of the T-cell epitope for CTL in patients with HLA-A2.1 has led to the design of a " therapeutic vaccine " to stimulate the immune system to eliminate HBV-infected cells selectively . One approach , now close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tsub h ) peptide from tetanus toxoid and two palmitic acid molecules . A potential risk is an overwhelming immune response , which could lead to massive destruction of infected hepatocytes . Viral Interactions <p> Hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) , a defective virus that requires HBV to supply the envelope proteins , only infects man in the presence of HBV , either as a coinfection or as a superinfection in HBV carriers . With coinfection , the clinical course is usually self-limiting because the HDV can not outlive the transient HBV infection , but with a superinfection , the attack can be very severe . In patients with chronic HBV and HDV coinfection the HDV suppresses HBV replication without significant effect on the expression of HBsAg. ( n43 ) This HBV-inhibitory mechanism of HDV , if identified , could provide a new treatment strategy for chronic HBV infection . <p> HBV and HIV coinfection is common because the risk factors for the two viruses are similar . The liver disease in such coinfections is usually mild , despite active HBV replication , and this may be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impairment of T h cells ( CD4+ ) and monocytes , the main targets of HIV . HIV infection is also associated with a suboptimal production of IFN Alpha which may allow HBV persistence and reduce the immune-mediated attack on HBV-infected hepatocytes. ( n44 ) On the reverse side of the coin , HBV may enhance HIV replication . Production of IFN Alpha in the circulation is suboptimal in chronic HBV infection and this may permit HIV replication ; the HBVX protein can trans-activate HIV replication ; and the increased production of TNF Alpha in chronic HBV infection can stimulate the HIV enhancer and hence replication . Hepatocarcinogenesis <p> The strong association of persistent HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is intriguing , yet poorly understood . Although the relative risk of HCC developing in HBV carriers is as high as 100 times that in matched controls , it usually takes decades for HCC to emerge . Since HBV integration can occur early , this suggests that HBV does not have an oncogene in its genome . Integration of HBV adjacent to cellular oncogenes , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene has come under suspicion because of its trans-activating activity . Various cellular oncogenes , such as c-myc and c-ras , have been implicated but none has been shown to be consistently activated in HCC . The strong association of cirrhosis with HCC suggests that the common pathway for hepatocarcinogenesis may be chronic hepatic injury and regeneration , which in some way promote the induction or selection of a malignant clone . <p> HCC may well be a heterogeneous disease with cellular oncogene and common pathway models both operating to varying extents . Further understanding of this heterogeneity may help in the establishment of the mechanisms involved in HCC -- as happened with our understanding of the pathobiology of lymphoma and leukaemia in the wake of the identification of subtypes by phenotypic markers . Other potential developments <p> The hepatotropism of HBV has led research workers to consider using the virus as an organ-targeting vector for gene delivery . However , the HBV genome is so small and compact that the molecular engineering is difficult . Table 1 .

@@4020641 Radial head and neck fractures are the most common elbow fractures among adults , typically encountered in young to middle-aged individuals ( 1 ) . The treatment of these fractures depend on the degree of comminution , the percentage of articular surface involved , the presence of loose intra-articular fragments and the angulation between the radial neck and proximal shaft . We report a case of bilateral symmetrical radial head fractures in view of its rarity of presentation and also briefly discuss the management options of Type 1 radial head fractures . Case Report <p> A 24 year old female , a carer by occupation presented with pain in both the elbows after she sustained a fall on an outstretched hand with both the elbows in extension while playing netball . On physical examination she had minimal bruising on the right elbow with tenderness over the radiocapitellar joints on both the sides . There was no restriction to the range of movements . There was no distal neurovascular deficit . AP and lateral radiographs of both the elbows revealed symmetrical undisplaced radial head fractures ( fig.1 ) . Patient was given cuff and a collar slings on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows out of the slings as much as the pain allows . At 3 week review she had significant pain relief , slings were discarded and patient advised active physiotherapy for elbow ROM . At latest follow-up 4 months after the injury she had no pain in both the elbows . On the right side she had restriction of terminal 5 of extension with full flexion and full ROM of the left elbow ( fig.2 ) . She had been carrying out her routine activities and has gone back to her job as a carer . Discussion <p> Fractures of the radial head result from fall on outstretched hand . The force is transmitted along the line of the forearm producing a valgus stress at the elbow . Compression of the radial head against the capitellum commonly results in fractures due to shearing between the vertically aligned trabeculae and may also produce macroscopic damage to the capitellum . Anatomically the radial head is susceptible to fractures because of a 15 angle between the radial neck and shaft . The greater carrying angle of the female elbow may explain the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , local tenderness with associated swelling , and a positive fat pad sign with a fracture line are diagnostic features . The main problem after radial head fracture is failure to gain full extension , probably caused by fibrosis of the anterior capsule of the joint after organisation of haemarthrosis ( 3 ) and damage sustained by the capitellum of the humerus at the time of injury ( 2 ) <p> Conventional radiography with AP &; Lateral views are adequate for detection of radial head and neck fractures . Internal and external oblique radiographs are required occasionally . A special view the radiocapitellar view has been shown to increase the sensitivity by only 1% ( 7 ) and hence is not routinely used . CT with reconstruction images is of helpful in doubtful cases and aid in decision making . <p> Treatment options are based on the classification of Mason ( 1 ) who divided radial head fractures into three groups : Type I , fissure or marginal fractures without displacement ; Type II , marginal sector fractures with displacement ; Type III , comminuted fractures , involving entire head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Type IV , any radial head fracture with dislocation of the humeroulnar joint <p> By definition , type I is an undisplaced fracture , requires no reduction , and does not exhibit any mechanical block to forearm rotation . Immediate pain relief should be achieved to allow initial physical examination and to start active forearm rotation as pain allows . Type I injuries should be treated conservatively as in this case . Joint aspiration of haemarthrosis and injection of an anaesthetic into the joint may be performed to reduce pain . Early motion helps to shape and mould slight incongruities without substantial risk of displacement . <p> Mason and Shutkin ( 4 ) suggested that early mobilisation allows the fragment to find the best functional position in relation to the other joint surfaces . Bakalim ( 5 ) showed that displacement of the fragment was not associated with loss of function .

They stated that aspiration of the elbow is a quick , safe , and painless procedure , which greatly reduces discomfort to the patient and allows early return of movement of the elbow , but failed to show any difference in the functional outcome between the aspirated and non aspirated group.Carley ( 10 ) suggested that aspiration may benefit patients with traumatic elbow effusions and that the evidence was insufficient to recommend it as a routine procedure . <p> We conclude that type 1 radial head fractures are to be treated conservatively .

@@4004741 As a physical educator , it is somewhat interesting to ask students , as well as adults from the general population , a simple question . " If you took a true high school physical education class , what was it like ? " Many respondents indicate that their remembrances are similar to what Dougherty and Bonanno ( 1987 ) refer to as the traditional , or activity-based , curriculum . This curricular pattern is based almost entirely on the activity , or sport , that is currently in season . This type of program is advantageous for the students in the class who are interested in the sport in season . In many instances , there is very little instruction involved in this curricular form . The emphasis is on allowing the students to play the activity , and little else . The emphasis of this program is primarily on team sports , with very little time being given to activities that would be considered lifetime sports . Unfortunately , this curricular pattern remains very popular in many high schools today ( Dougherty &; Bonanno , 1987 ) . When this curricular pattern is used in a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is then difficult to justify to administrators the value of physical education . This type of physical education curriculum does not appear to meet the challenges that school physical education currently faces ( Dougherty &; Bonanno , 1987 ) . <p> A current topic of interest is how well current secondary physical education is achieving such objectives as the development of appropriate levels of health-related physical fitness ( HRPF ) . There appears to be an assumption that in general , youth in America are not as physically fit as they were 20 to 30 years ago , although certain researchers ( Corbin &; Pangrazi , 1992 ) question the validity of this statement . Another question that perhaps is just as important concerns the development of positive attitudes toward physical activity by high school students . There is little or no empirical evidence which suggests that current students ' attitudes toward physical activity are less positive than the attitudes of past students . However , the development of positive attitudes toward physical activity in today 's physical education students remains an important objective of the physical educator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) found that physically inactive adults were not likely to have engaged in physical activity during adolescence , suggesting that the subjects lacked favorable physical activity in their adolescent years . Ferguson , Yesalis , Pomrehn , and Kirk-patrick ( 1989 ) concluded that early development of positive attitudes toward exercise may play an important role in an individual 's inclination to maintain an active lifestyle . A goal of all physical educators should be for their students to become active , physically fit adults . The research appears to suggest that if physical educators hope to achieve this goal , they should provide their students with favorable experiences in physical activity . Teachers should also strive to help their students develop positive attitudes toward physical activity . In other words , it is important for teachers to teach the " process " of how to develop and maintain personal physical fitness . Teaching the " product " of personal physical fitness is important , but not to the exclusion of the process . Development of HRPF and of positive attitudes toward physical activity in students should continue to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curricular pattern is thus needed that is designed both to develop elevated levels of HRPF , and to instill positive attitudes toward physical activity in students . While traditional curricular patterns can achieve these objectives , it is the purpose of this paper to present an alternative curricular form . <p> The suggested alternative is a Foundations of Personal Fitness ( FPF ) course for high school students . It has been demonstrated that through participation in a course of this type , students do attain improved levels of HRPF ( Murray et al. , 1995 ) . Students enrolled in a high school FPF class were able to make significant improvements in selected aspects of HRPF ( strength and cardiovascular endurance ) . Cuddihy , Corbin , and Abbadessa ( 1995 ) discovered that students who participated in an FPF course , when compared to students who were enrolled in a traditional physical education class , had built higher levels of intrinsic motivation and competence , which are deemed to be likely determinants of physical activity . Cuddihy et al . ( 1995 ) also found that students developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical activity , and that sedentary students became more active . Concerning Florida high school seniors who had taken the Florida-form of the FPF course in the ninth grade , Bie et al . ( 1994 ) found that almost 80 percent of those surveyed thought all high school students should be exposed to the information contained in the FPF course . The results of these studies suggest that students are learning both the product and process of personal physical fitness . Also , three years after completing the FPF course , students continue to perceive the course to be an important part of their high school experience . The primary objectives of the FPF course would therefore be achieved . <p> While Florida led the way in the 1980 's in implementing a course of this nature , the state of Texas has been developing this course since the early 1990 's . Beginning in 1996 , an ( FPF ) course has been mandated for Texas high school students . The FPF course was developed from the Florida model ( Florida Department of Education , 1984 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Corbin and Lindsey ( 1990 ) . A set of Essential Elements for the course has been developed and adopted ( for summary of Essential Elements , see Appendix A. For a complete copy of the Essential Elements for the course , contact the author at the University of Texas-San Antonio ) which outlines the Essential Knowledge and Skills which should be discussed and developed in the course ( Texas Education Agency , 1992 ) . <p> An interesting aspect of the course is that students are placed in situations where they are allowed to participate in a variety of physical activities related to developing components of personal fitness . They are taught a variety of means to assess their own personal levels of these components of physical fitness , and are encouraged to choose the activity they will use for assessment , based on individual preference . For example , Essential Element 1 ( see Appendix 1 ) deals with analysis of components of physical fitness . Students participate in activities designed to improve one 's level of physical fitness , and are taught how to assess their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example , students could be involved in such activities as jogging , walking , aerobic dance , jumping rope , or a myriad of other activities . Then , students could participate in various assessments of cardiovascular endurance : the 1.5-mile run test , the one-mile walk test , the step test , the Astrand-Ryhming test , or the 12-minute swim test ( Hoeger &; Hoeger , 1994 ) . In each student 's individual exercise plan ( see Essential Element 13 , Appendix 1 ) , they will note which activity , or activities , and assessment tool they have chosen . Thus , students are placed in situations where they have the responsibility for making individual decisions which affect them ; they make choices based on individual preference . This provides an excellent opportunity for the teacher to integrate critical thinking skills and responsible decision-making into the physical education curriculum . <p> Evaluation of student level of performance in this class may take place in several forms , with performance in the psychomotor domain not being the exclusive factor for grade determination . For example , Essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the components of physical fitness . Not only might students be expected to be able to list and define these on a written examination , they might also be expected to participate in self-assessments to determine their personal levels of each one of the components of physical fitness . They might also be expected to be able to identify activities which would develop certain fitness components of fitness . The self-assessments might be used as a group activity , utilizing a cooperative learning style , where one group of students might be charged with identifying levels of a particular fitness component possessed by class members . They might then identify for the class a certain program of exercise or activities which would lead to improved levels of the particular fitness component . Thus , cooperation and teamwork become an emphasis . Cooperative-type activities also provide the opportunity to teach group dynamics , another desirable life skill . Other forms of written examinations and demonstration tests may also be used , as well as individual notebooks . One is limited only by imagination . <p> In conclusion , this course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary benefits derived from participation in physical education and activity : developing improved levels of HRPF , learning the values of cooperation and teamwork , while allowing for individual choices and responses . The FPF course has the goal that every student will leave the course with a positive attitude toward participating in physical activity , which sounds much preferable to the perception many adults now retain of their experiences in high school physical education . While this goal may be achieved through other more traditional curricular forms , the essential elements that have been set forth for the FPF class can provide a vehicle which may be used to achieve this goal . Also , this course is presented in a way that makes it more palatable and defensible to parents , administrators , and school board members . Without the support of the above-named group , no physical education program is likely to be as successful as is desired . The FPF course can be an integral component of the total high school curriculum , and can make a major contribution to the total educational development of @ @ @ @ @ 
@@4017941 The IBM PowerPC 603e(TM) floating-point unit ( FPU ) is an on-chip functional unit to support IEEE 754 standard single- and double-precision binary floating-point arithmetic operations . The design objectives are to be a low-coat , low-power , high-performance engine in a single-chip superscalar microprocessor . Using less than 15 mm 2 of the available silicon area on the chip ( the size of the PowerPC 603e microprocessor is 98 mm 2 ) and operating at the peak clock frequency of 100 MHz , an average single-pumping multiply-add-fuse instruction has one-cycle throughput and four-cycle latency . An average double-pumping multiply-add-fuse instruction has two-cycle throughput and five-cycle latency . The estimated performance at 100 MHz is 105 against the SPECfp92(TM) benchmark . Introduction <p> The skeleton of the IBM PowerPC 603e(TM) FPU architecture is optimized to perform a multiply and an add operation 1-3 in a single floating-point instruction : <p> FRT = FRA * FRC + FRB , ( 1 ) <p> where FRT is the target operand , and FRA , FRB , and FRC are the three source operands . Each of the four operands can be any one of the 32 user-accessible floating-point registers ( FPRs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and multiply instructions can easily be derived from this multiply-add-fuse instruction by forcing FRC to the constant 1.0 or FRB to the constant 0.0 . <p> The 603e 1 FPU data flow architecture comprises three independent pipeline stages -- the multiply , the carry-propagate-add ( CPA ) , and the Writeback ( WB ) . Each stage requires only one clock cycle to execute in a normal situation . In addition to the 32 user-accessible FPRs , there are four floating-point rename buffers to provide temporary storage for the execution result . These rename buffers are used to allow fast result forwarding for the next instruction and to avoid storage dependency problems . There is hardware to support floating-point divide , **25;867;TOOLONG conversion , denorm input operands , denorm result , IEEE exception handlers , three new graphics instructions , and non-IEEE mode for fast execution . <p> Figure 1 shows the 603e FPU as a function unit which takes instructions from the dispatch unit . The operands can come from either the FPR or the rename buffers . The result is placed at the preassigned rename buffer only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with LSSD testability . The implementation employs an ASIC design methodology approach to speed up the design cycle time for chip integration ; however , most of the building elements of the 603e FPU are fully custom designed for the specific application in order to achieve peak performance . The control logic is synthesized , placed , and routed automatically . The logic is verified by a random test generation program through both an FPU stand-alone simulation model and a whole-chip simulation model . <p> The 603e FPU has two types of execution modes -- scientific mode and real-time mode . The scientific mode is implemented for precise scientific computations and engineering applications that require high precision and execution power . This mode conforms to ANSI/IEEE Standard 754-1985 4 , the " IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic " ( hereafter referred to as the " IEEE standard " ) , including all four rounding modes and exception status reporting , but it does have a dependency on supporting software in order to do so . All floating-point operations conform to that standard , except when software sets the floating-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and control register ( FPSCR ) to 1 , i.e. , real-time mode , in which case floating-point operations conform to a subset of the IEEE standard -- all results are produced without software assistance ( without causing a **27;894;TOOLONG program interrupt , a floating-point-assist interrupt , or a fast-trap ) . All exceptions are handled by hardware , and default numbers such as quiet not-a-number ( QNaN ) , maximum , and zero are output according to the exception . Basic instruction pipeline stage and timing <p> The PowerPC 603e FPU comprises three major stages ( Figure 2 ) . The first stage of the FPU engine is the multiply stage . It performs the main multiply function of FRA times FRC using a 53 by 28-bit Booth recoding Wallace tree multiplier array 5 , 6 to generate the accumulated partial product in the sum-and-carry format . Concurrently , FRB is only right-shifted to align with the result of FRA times FRC . Finally , the aligned FRB and the result of FRA times FRC are compressed by a 3-to-2 carry-save adder . To save silicon area , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full 53 by 53-bit array using three levels of 4-to-2 carry-save adders . For a double-precision multiply operation , it requires double pumping through the multiplier array . <p> The second stage is the carry-propagate-add stage , which performs a 161-bit one 's complement add using a carry-lookahead adder . The result of the operation goes through a leading-zero detector for normalization shift-count calculation . <p> The third stage is the WB stage , which performs the normalization left shift , rounding , and status generation operations . The final result is stored in one of the four rename buffers and/or forwarded back to the multiply stage for the next instruction execution . The rename buffer content does not update the FPR until the instruction is architecturally completed . <p> Figures 3 and 4 respectively show typical timing examples involving three single-pumping and three double-pumping instructions . For single-precision multiply instructions ( and instructions which do not have the multiply function incorporated in them ) without data dependency , the throughput is one per clock cycle , and the latency is four cycles . For double-precision multiply instructions without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycles , and the latency is five cycles . **27;923;TOOLONG <p> Figure 4 shows the major building clements in the 603e FPU for the multiply-add-fuse instruction . The three independent pipeline stages ( multiply , CPA , WB ) require one clock cycle to execute under a normal situation . Extra cycles are required for situations such as the following : For a full double-precision multiply operation , an extra cycle is required for iterating in the multiply stage to double-pump the operand or intermediate result through the multiplier array . The normalization shifter is implemented with a 63-bit left shifter , and in the event of mass cancellation in the mantissa calculation , the WB stage could require one or two extra clock cycles to execute . Underflow and overflow exceptions require an extra cycle in the WB stage for exponent correction . Denormalization of results requires an extra cycle . Bypass unit <p> The block diagram in Figure 5 shows a bypass unit -- used to handle abnormal executions ( i.e. , the abnormal operands NaN and infinity , and abnormal operations such as divide by zero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The normal multiply and CPA stages are bypassed , and the default result is fed to the WB state to simplify the datapath logic . The bypass unit also manipulates the FPSCR for FPSCR instructions , and handles the graphic-instruction floating-point conditional select register . <p> -- Multiplier array <p> The 603e multiplier is a high-performance fully pipelined multiplier which uses radix-4 Booth recoding 5 to halve the summands ( partial products ) which must be added and a Wallace tree 6 of 4-to-2 CSAs to minimize the time necessary to add the summands together . The multiplier configuration is a 54 x 28 arrangement capable of unsigned operations . The 603e single-precision floating-point multiplication can be operated at the rate of one instruction per cycle . For double-precision multiplications , the operands are double-pumped at each stage to obtain the desired results with the required precision . <p> Figure 6 shows the multiplier array structure . The two feedback paths for the most significant bits of the sum and carry each use a 2:1 mux which allows the results of the first pass to be incorporated into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The CPA is implemented as a 161-bit one 's complement adder with an end-around-carry adjustment . It accepts one 's complement input from the aligned FRB , and it accepts the result of FRA * FRC , which is always positive relative to FRB from the multiply stage . The output is represented in sign-magnitude format with the sign bit handled in control logic . The CPA consists of three pieces , as shown in Figure 7 . Since the lower 26-bit product from the multiply array is generated from the first CPA cycle by the carry-lookahead adder ( CLA ) and saved , the lower 26-bit portion of the 161-bit CPA is an incrementer instead of a CLA . Since carry-lookahead incrementers are smaller and faster than carry-lookahead adders , the actual CLA is only 88 bits wide . <p> The propagate from the carry-lookahead incrementer and the group identifier generated by the 87-bit CLA are fed back to the carry-in to correct the end-around-carry problem without a closed loop . XOR gates are used at the output to invert the result back to sign-magnitude format . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it easier to convert the result back to sign-magnitude format . The upper 63-bit portion of the 161-bit CPA result is examined for the number of leading zeros for normalization shift count in the next stage . <p> -- Alignment shifter <p> The alignment shifter for the B mantissa is reduced to a 53-bit-input 136-bit-output right shifter through double-pumping . It is implemented as a partial decode having three levels in a multistage structure with partial-shift groups , or as a modulo shifter ( maximum shift count of 143 ) , since each nested shift amount is calculated with modulo arithmetic . Figure 8 shows the three levels , which carry out shifts of binary ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) ; multiples of 4 bits ( 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 ) ; and multiples of 16 bits ( 0 , 16 , 32 , 48 , 64 , 80 , 96 , 112 , 128 ) , respectively . Shifting arising from a negative shift count is prevented by a bypass port in the third level that takes advantage of critical timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two levels . The alignment shifter also includes the automatic sticky-bit detection logic for the bits that are shifted off . <p> -- LZD ( leading-zero detector ) <p> Three 63-bit LZDs inside the FPU are used to calculate the number of leading zeros . The most time-critical one is at the CPA stage after the 161-bit add . It is implemented by three levels of coarse and fine circuits . The first level contains sixteen 4-bit leading-zero-detect circuits . The second level contains four 16-bit leading-zero-detect circuits . The final level contains one 64-bit leading-zero-detect circuit . The other two LZDs are not time-critical and are implemented by synthesis . <p> -- Normalization shifter <p> The normalization shifter comprises three levels and is not a complete shifter . The maximum shift count is 63 . For a normal CPA result , it requires only one pass through to generate the normalization result . For the case of mass cancellation from unlike-sign add operations , it requires one to two extra cycles to normalize the result . A sticky bit is also accumulated for bits beyond bit 53 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each containing a 70-bit floating-point number . The format of this 70-bit number includes a 3-bit tag , a 1-bit sign , a 13-bit exponent , and a 53-bit mantissa . The FPR register array has one write port from one of the four rename buses . The data transfer control signals and address for the write come from the completion unit , which allows updates from either the writeback unit or the load/store unit . The FPR register array also has three read ports for latching the three operands ( FRA , FRB , and FRC ) needed to execute an instruction . The data transfer control signals and addresses for the three reads come from the dispatch unit . Finally , the FPR register array also has one more read port to the load/store unit . The data transfer control signals and address for this read come from the load/store unit . The four reads and one write can take place at the same time . <p> -- Division <p> The 603e FPU employs a 2-bit nonrestoring division algorithm which produces two correct mantissa bits per cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal double-precision divide requires 33 cycles to execute , utilizing most of the existing hardware . Exception detection and handling <p> The 603e FPU detects exceptions in two parts -- an early detect in the first cycle of instruction execution ( multiply ) in the bypass unit , and a late detect in the last cycle of instruction execution ( WB ) . All seven invalid operations exceptions ( Inf - Inf , Inf * Zero , SNan , etc. ) and the zero-divide exception fall in the early-detect category , while all overflow , underflow , and inexact exceptions fall in the late-detect category . For cases of exceptions with corresponding exception-enable bits that are clear in the FPSCR , early detection in the bypass unit is carried out with exponent and mantissa checking , and appropriate default results are generated , while late detection is handled by generating a meaningful result . For enabled exceptions , early-detect exceptions stall the dispatch unit from dispatching further FPU instructions , whereas for late-detect exceptions an adjusted result is prepared and loaded into the rename bus . <p> Figure 9 shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard assumes that it should be possible to identify the instruction that triggers an exception trap . The 603e FPU identifies each executed instruction with a 3-bit IDN ( ID number assigned during dispatch ) , which is passed on to the completion unit along with the finish signal for an instruction . The completion unit handles situations such as misplaced branches and out-of-order completion among the FPU , the fixed-point unit ( FXU ) , and the load store unit ( LSU ) , and fires a complete signal for the FPU to update architected registers . FPSCR control <p> The floating-point status and condition register ( FPSCR ) is implemented inside the FPU . Each bit in the FPSCR belongs to one of three categories : 1 ) report exception ( sticky ) , 2 ) status , and 3 ) enable and programming mode control bits . The FPSCR is accessed by the following two groups of instructions : FPSCR instructions This group requires machine serialization . Floating-point arithmetic , multiply-add , rounding , and conversion and compare instructions This group does not require instruction serialization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to maintain the FPSCRs in program order . The update from one of two rename FPSCRs to the master FPSCR takes place when the completion unit announces that the associated instruction is completed . <p> The FPSCR is implemented with a full 32-bit master architectural FPSCR and two 17-bit FPSCR rename buffers which are implemented with a stack structure as shown in Figure 10 . The FPSCR rename buffers contain the non-sticky-status bits of ox , ux , zx , xx , vxsnan , vxisi , vxidi , vxzdz , vximz , vxvc , vxcvi , fr , fi , and fprf . <p> The FPSCR renames are updated by the instruction which is at the final cycle of the WB stage . When the completion unit retires the finished FPU instruction , the architectural FPSCR is updated from the bottom of the FPSCR rename stack , and the stack is decremented . When both FPSCR renames in the stack are full , the FPU will be stalled until the FPSCR rename which is on the top of the FPSCR rename stack is free again . Figure 10 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state diagram for the FPSCR rename control . Under the assumptions listed below , the performance lost due to stall caused by the lack of FPSCR rename buffers is minimal : Given that there are only four target rename buffers which are being shared with the LSU , and assuming that on the average , the FPU uses only half the number of the target rename buffers , the FPU will be stalled in any case by the lack of target rename buffers . Therefore , only two FPSCR rename buffers are needed to match the four target rename buffers . The probability of having a long instruction ( e.g. , FXU divide , LSU with a miss ) in front of a floating-point instruction is very small . Most FPU applications will not be delayed . **32;952;TOOLONG <p> In the 603e FPU , denormalized source operands are prenormalized by using the normalization shifter in the writeback stage. 2 The bypass unit contains the logic which detects denormalized source operands and stalls the FPU from accepting further instructions . The denormalized operand bypasses the multiply and CPA stages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of denormalized sources , three to five extra cycles are required before the instruction commences execution . A single denormalized source utilizes three extra cycles , where two and three denormalized sources take four and five extra cycles , respectively . Prenormalization is carried out for all instructions which could potentially cause an error in certain cases with denormalized source operands . The prenormalized number is fed back to the EIB for normal execution via the rename bus that was pre-assigned for the target register of that instruction . <p> The extra hardware required for handling denormalized operands consists of a leading-zero detector ( LZD ) in the bypass unit , and minimal logic to detect denormalized operands and to stall the FPU . The LZD in the CPA stage fell in a time-critical path and was not used , since introducing a 2:1 mux in the path would compromise timing . Since the bypass LZD was not time-critical , it was implemented using synthesis . <p> The denormalization operation for denormalized results is handled at the writeback stage . The normalization shifter can only left-shift from 0 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the final exponent is computed , if a denorm operation is required , the result is looped back to the WB pipeline register with a 56-bit hardwired right shift while the multiply and CPA stages are stalled . Another left shift is performed by left-shifting the result by ( 56 minus the number of the denorm bit position ) . The denormalizing operation requires an extra cycle . The extra hardware required is an extra port in the writeback register . Design methodology <p> The 603e FPU was described in a proprietary high-level register-transfer design language called Design Structure Language ( DSL ) . The DSL compilers accept hardware constructs in a program like manner and support many levels of hierarchy for a macro design approach . Customized , hand-placed circuits ( off-the-shelf , or OTS , macros ) were used to lead to optimal timing and density for memory elements , multiplexors , and challenging functions . Control logic was developed by allowing synthesis to map the high-level , functional model for each random logic macro ( RLM ) to primitive gates in the technology library .

MCSPICE was used for detail circuit simulation on critical speed paths , before and after layout . Summary <p> The IBM PowerPC 603e floating-point unit is an IEEE- 754-compliant fused multiply-add design . With complete hardware support for denormalized numbers , overflow and underflow processing , and invalid operation exceptions , the 603e requires the same minimum software envelope as high-end RS/6000(TM) processors .

@@4011241 Go on from where you left off , said Mr. Magershon , not from where you began . Or are you like Darwin 's caterpillar ? ( n1 ) <p> Caterpillar logic provides the model for Samuel Beckett 's production , where series upon series go on from where they begin , where " going on " finally takes priority over all ends . And where Beckett leaves off , without having finished , we find Bruce Nauman(n2) revolving it all again , leaving us differently at the same spot somewhere in the middle , so that Nauman 's work agitates in the same way that the events at Mr. Knott 's agitate Watt : <p> What distressed Watt in this incident of the Galls father and son , and in subsequent similar incidents , was not so much that he did not know what had happened , for he did not care what had happened , as that nothing had happened , that a thing that was nothing had happened , with the utmost formal distinctness , and that it continued to happen , in his mind , he supposed , though he did not know exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , before him , about him , and so on , inexorably to unroll its phases , beginning with the first ( the knock that was not a knock ) and ending with the last ( the door closing that was not a door closing ) , and omitting none , uninvoked , at the most unexpected moments , and the most inopportune . ( Watt , p. 76 ) <p> Reading Nauman through Beckett , our discussion can only retrace these lines . Nonetheless , by revisiting " The old thing where it always was , back again " ( Watt , p. 44 ) , we find ourselves in hot pursuit of nothing , which is exactly where Beckett and Nauman wanted to place us . It 's a little too like running Lewis Carroll 's Caucus-race , and we can start and stop where we like ( since everybody wins by sheer virtue of having at some point run ) . As a matter of consistency , however , we could keep pace with Watt , whose first memory of the Galls coming to tune Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first ( the knock that was not a knock ) ... <p> Think of sound specifically , as the knock that begins an encounter , with Nauman 's single-channel video Wall-Floor Positions ( 1968 ) . The work can be seen ( without playing the tape ) in a succession of photographic stills to reveal Nauman , acting a bad version of the sideshow contortionist . In these closely cropped frames , Nauman assumes every position except for the vertical one , turning the entire body into a single part-object that refuses to produce symmetry . By themselves , the pictures initiate a certain discomfort through an insistence on horizontality . What can not be guessed without playing the tape , however , is that the crucial aspect of Wall-Floor Positions is the first moment , when Nauman enters the frame , falling into focus with a thud . Each subsequent pose is carried off with a similar slam of foot or hand . Each noise , in turn , cocoons itself within what seems an unendurable pause . Such passages " from silence to sound and from sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incessantly recurring events of Watt 's memory , no less than our experience of Nauman 's looping videos or Beckett 's regressive plays . This passage of sound is what strikes first and hardest in Wall-Floor Positions , making similar impact in Beckett 's 1966 television play Eh Joe. ( n3 ) After moments of solitary quiet , paranoid Joe ventures toward the window of his bare room , suddenly drawing apart the curtains with a violent rattle . A lull follows , broken again when Joe approaches the second window and rips the drapes apart once more . The unexpected noise , jolting enough at first , becomes doubly alarming in its reiteration . For now , concentrate on this fact , that the sound must happen , in Beckett as in Nauman , always more than once . <p> In order for a knock to be a knock , which might be recognized as " someone at the door , " the sound must normally recur , the second proving that the first was not just the banging of a branch but the work of communication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals " that the uttered sounds do not represent a babble , but a senseful , semantic entity . " ( n4 ) What if , on the other hand , as Watt proposes , the knock is not simply a knock , in that it occurs not twice , but too many times ? What happens , for instance , when a word is repronounced until that senseful semantic entity collapses into a series of too-distinct phonemes ? The result is not simply babble . Rather , what the excess finally signals is its own presence . The sound then , not of someone at the door , but of knock-knock-knock-knock -- and this mechanism of repetition . ... in subsequent similar incidents ... <p> Jacques Derrida describes repetition not as posterior to the origin , but somehow simultaneous with it , " a trace which replaces a presence which has never been present . " ( n5 ) The notion of an autonomous origin , then , is a kind of lure , a fantasy : <p> The first book , the mythic book , the eve prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center was sheltered from play : irreplaceable , withdrawn from metaphor and metonomy , a kind of invariable first name that could be invoked but not repeated . The center of the first book should not have been repeatable in its own representation . Once it lends itself a single time to such a representation -- that is to say , once it is written -- when one can read a book in the book , an origin in the origin , a center in the center , it is the abyss , is the bottomlessness of infinite redoubling ? ( n6 ) <p> Affirming , like Jakobson , that signs are born in their capacity to be repeated , Derrida goes on to venture that at the mystical center where there is no such play of origin , we find death . Repetition is thus conceived not as supplementary accumulation , but as an essential operation , as the " bottomlessness " that provides the very grounds for existence . It finds voice in Beckett 's and Nauman 's production , when a spoken phrase becomes a maddening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming sameness . Through these repetitions , refusing an isolated origin , Beckett anti Nauman show being , so that one might have mentioned to the other , as did Estragon to Vladimir , " We always find something , eh , Didi , to give us the impression we exist " ( n7 ) <p> And this " something , " constantly rehearsed , is often precisely nothing . Nothing but the phrase " lip synch " whispered until the throat dries ( Nauman , Lip Synch 1968 ) , nothing but the strum of D , E , A , D on a violin until the arm tires ( Nauman , Violin Tuned D E A D 1969 ) , nothing but the sound of a woman 's relentless pacing across the stage ( Beckett , Footfalls 1976 ) . These exercises , however , consistently maintain themselves as failed affirmations , as finally only " impressions , " which in their patent actuality always ever return to the question " We exist ? " For this is also the function of repetition , to unmake the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of model and copy , as Derrida describes : " We are faced then with mimicry imitating nothing ; faced , so to speak , with a double that doubles no simple , a double that nothing anticipates , nothing at least that is not itself already double . " ( n8 ) Rather than reaffirming the identity of the one , repetition inspires the rabid production of another , from which the one can not extricate itself , but with which it will never be identical . It is this relationship of nonidentity , somewhere between parasitic and symbiotic , which Beckett and Nauman force their characters to endure with every recurrence ? ( n9 ) <p> In Nauman 's video installation Clown Torture ( 1987 ) , four different clowns , one after another , tell the same joke while balancing on one leg : " It was a dark and stormy night . Three men were sitting around a campfire . One of the men said , ' Tell us a story , Jack , ' and Jack said , It was a dark and stormy night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men said , " Tell us a story , Jack , " and Jack said , " It was a dark and stormy night ... ' .... On its own the joke enacts with marvelous economy the disruptive brand of repetition theorized by Derrida . Around the campfire is spun a tale of " infinite redoubling " in which no origin can be isolated . The joke exists without author and , under Nauman 's unfunny direction , is even robbed of its object . The only logic to the joke is one identified by Freud in his famous study , which observes that intrinsic to the " joke-work " is the process of its being told -- in other words , of its being repeated. ( n10 ) Through each recital , performed now by an Emmett Kelly clown , then by a French baroque type , now by a jester , then by a clown in polka dots and big shoes , the similar incident spins into a series of what Derrida would call differends , terms in which " difference inscribes itself without any decidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( nll ) Creating a confusion between two clowns and then four ( without there ever having been one in the first place ) , Nauman 's Clown Torture enacts this doubling , proving that even in the face of infinite regress , ( n12 ) " It 's never going to be the same .... " ( n13 ) <p> Implicated in this specular mechanism is an elimination , partly of narrative and completely of eschatology . Take Nauman 's video Bouncing in the Corner ( 1968 ) . Despite dissimilarities among its beats , the stream of thumps produced as Nauman bounces his body into the corner of a studio still engages a continuity , a reassurance that the action is only minimally changing , only repeating . Nauman aptly describes the function of sound , here acting as if " to whistle down a dark space -- say cellar stairs -- and fill the void to make sure that nothing else is in there . " ( n14 ) Sound , in other words , assuring us of an absence , so that we can shut our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thud , be fairly certain that we have missed nothing . The experience , something like listening to the Weather Channel on TV while getting dressed in the morning . ... and that it continued to happen ... <p> In Clown Torture , no punchline , no denouement , just a shaggy-dog tale constantly rewound . As such , I could run the tape as I would run the Caucus-race , start and stop where I like . The order , while perhaps not irrelevant , is certainly changeable in the fashion of Watt 's narration : " As Watt told the beginning of his story , not first , but second , so not fourth , but third , now he told its end . Two , one , four , three , that was the order in which Watt told his story " ( Watt , p. 215 ) . Nauman names such a format " this circular kind of story . " It goes back , he says , <p> to Warhol films that really have no beginning or end . You could walk in at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still asleep , or whatever . The circularity is also a lot like La Monte Young 's idea about music . The music is always going on .... It 's a way of structuring something so that you do n't have to make a story , ( n15 ) <p> In order to understand what Nauman means by referring to a story that is n't a story , but more like circular music , we might first think of tempo . <p> In his introductory essay for Alain Robbe-Grillet 's pair of novels Jealousy and In the Labyrinth , Roland Barthes makes a distinction between two concepts of time. ( n16 ) The first one , classical , transforms with a reason , an ulterior motive : glory , decay , disappearance . Barthes contrasts this with Robbe-Grillet 's temporality , during which " an object , described for the first time at a certain moment in the novel 's progress , reappears later on , but with a barely perceptible difference . It is a difference of a situational or spatial order -- what was on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( n17 ) Transformation here consists of permutation without decay , disappearance , or mystery : " time is never a corruption or even a catastrophe , but merely a change of place , a hideout for data . " ( n18 ) Nauman often refers to his work as data : " Lack of information input ( sensory deprivation ) .... Pieces of information which are in skew ' rather than clearly contradictory , i.e. , kinds of information which come from and go to unrelated response mechanism . " ( n19 ) Using information to take time , using time as a way of structuring information , Nauman 's work lends itself to the logic of videotape and television chatter . <p> Mary Ann Doane describes television as " the textual technology of information theory , " ( n20 ) whose effect is rigorous decontextualization and the abolition of narrative . The important distinction Doane makes , however , is that television does not merely transmit this flow of information in its fragmented , multiple form , but dramatizes it through catastrophic interruptions . These discontinuities veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , disguising machine time in the operations of classical time . Beckett and Nauman expose these theatrics , using them to insist precisely on the uneventful . Laying bare the structure of what Stanley Cavell calls television 's " undialectical " serial procedure , ( n21 ) Beckett and Nauman harp on noncatastrophic intrusions that fail utterly to destabilize a stable condition , returning always to the show " already in progress . " Understanding that TV flow is really " segmentation without closure , " ( n22 ) Beckett and Nauman make us watch as events cut through the series without ever successfully leaving their mark . <p> In Beckett 's color-television play , Quad I , four mimes pace around a square , " each following his particular course . " ( n23 ) Accompanied by a lively percussion , they walk feverishly , dropping in and out of the race in seemingly ordered sequence . To this fifteen-minute play Beckett wrote a five-minute sequel , Quad II . The action is essentially the same , but now with only two mimes , shot in black-and-white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue pacing around the square . " Yes , " Beckett said , " marvelous , it 's 100,000 years later . " ( n24 ) Between Quad I and Quad H lies a space of one hundred thousand years , but nothing much has changed . Beckett 's time remains unperturbed by incident . As Barthes describes , " it is an unwonted time , a time for nothing . " ( n25 ) <p> In Nauman 's Violent Incident ( 1986 ) a drama is enacted twelve times simultaneously , in a bank of television monitors . Nauman 's proposal for the work is simple : woman pulls chair out from under man , she gooses him , exchange of epithets , scuffling , she gets shot , he gets shot. ( n26 ) The scene is replayed in several variations : between two men , between two women , roles reversed , in slow motion , as a rehearsal , using differing color schemes , and so on . In these multiple views , the installation mobilizes Cavell 's concept of television as a space of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n27 ) The bank of screens , Cavell suggests , provides the best access to television , allowing for a " switching " from one instance to the next , conveniently , in case something were to happen . Necessary to the logic of television 's continuance , however , nothing ever does , and we are left in a state of perpetual suspense . The violent incident replays itself over and again , without death ever lending a point to the drama ; the gunshot proves to be not at all what we were waiting for . It was just another piece of information , like Beckett 's Quad , marking an " unwonted time . " <p> Or , to put it differently , in subjugating the event to a constant stream of simultaneity , Nauman has succeeded in mapping spatially what is characteristically conceived linearly , as time line . Jean-Luc Nancy describes the appropriateness of line for graphing " pure time " : " And so it is with good reason that the line representing it represents the static , unidimensional , nonspatial copresence of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the limit where space becomes pure time , but where pure time annuls the event ) . " ( n28 ) Pure time annuls the event , in being marked not as a thing which itself takes place , which creates and destroys . Rather , pure time exists as a series of " at onces " : " It is the altered sameness of time -- the untimeliness of time -- and it is thus that it is spacing , or that it is insofar as it spaces itself ' out . " ( n29 ) Violent Incident produces this " altered sameness " : in one take the man shoots last , in another , the woman ( what was once on the right is now on the left ) . And , as Nancy argues , this undialectical procedure requires a separation , a displacement ; but now , instead of dashes on a line , Nauman ( and Beckett too ) will tick , like a clock . <p> As with Wall-Floor Positions , even when the viewer leaves the bank of screens , he/she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the audio effect of a particular installation at Whitechapel : " Because it was in a separate room , the sound was baffled ; you only got the higher tones . So the main thing you heard throughout the museum was Asshole ! ' " ( n30 ) Imagine it , wandering through the exhibition , surrounded by normal , ambient noise , and then , every few minutes or so , a scream -- " 9 ! " -- reminding you of the fact that in spite of your absence , the incident continues to take place . Significantly , the scream recurs within spaces , between pockets of rest filled with every other sound , giving the false impression of somehow being over . A kind of rhythm is produced then , an oscillation that marks the persistence of goings-on intermittently , within blankets of white noise , punctuated by a high-pitched yell. ... ( the door closing that was not a door closing ) ... <p> Consider this rhythm during which , amplified along with the word " Asshole ! , " is all that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves forward . It seems in cases to promise a kind of closure , and instead delivers a prolongation of suspense , " ... the perpetual suspense of a tear that can never be entirely formed nor fall .... " ( n31 ) Nauman and Beckett do nothing but point to this almost-shutting that is the sound of Wall-Floor Positions , where a slam is always re-marked by a reopening , a silence . The pause is empty , and noticeably so , in order to distinguish itself as trap , as that space wherein information , data , stuff , accumulates and reformulates irrepressibly . Through Mallarme , Derrida has theorized this blank : <p> A folding back , once more : the hymen , " a medium , a pure medium of fiction , " is located between the present acts that do n't take place . What takes place is only the entre , the place , the spacing , which is nothing , the ideality ( as nothingness ) of the idea . No act , then , is perpetrated ( " Hymen ... between perpetration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime ? ( n32 ) <p> A hymen , figured by the white crease between two pages of a book ( or fifteen minutes between two acts of a play ) . <p> Waiting for Godot contains an intermission . The curtained stage marks the space of possibility and anticipation , which make all the more resonant the maddening recurrences on the stage of Act 2 : " Next day . Same time . Same place , " and Vladimir 's first words to Estragon , " You again ! " ( Waiting for Godot , p. 430 ) . ( n33 ) What becomes painfully apparent then is that the play is precisely this curtained stage , this space of no-event and perpetual waiting . Boasting of their endurance in this place , Vladimir will remark to Estragon , " We are not saints , but we have kept our appointment " ( Waitingf0r Godot , p. 458 ) . Godot , however , will never keep his appointment , and the play brackets nothing but this missed encounter : a meeting that was presumed to occur never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Act 2 signals no end , but a lingering nonfinality , the suspense of a pause ( a tear ) hovering between . Not too much unlike the brief switch between monitors , or as a video loops back around to the beginning . Violent Incident is marked by such hiccups , disturbances that call attention to what seems like the substance , the point of the work . Again , what one finds is that switch and flicker are all of Violent Incident . No crime is committed , nothing is perpetrated . " Asshole ! " is only part of the ambient noise after all , signaling nothing , except perhaps an appointment . The incident , it turns out , is about monitoring , waiting in between acts . <p> At the 1997 Whitney Biennial , Nauman 's video installation was called End of the World , leading one to expect an apocalypse , only to be met with some sad song perpetually dying . A series of three projected videos replayed differing takes of the same man ( whose body is always cropped so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( too many layers to know for sure ) , on a pedal steel guitar ( every one slightly altered from the last ) . The videos of each projection were segmented , stopping and starting in a kind of nonthematic orchestration , like entr'acte organ music . Certainly in this constant making and unmaking , there was no cataclysmic explosion then , only a lingering trace , a vestige , characterized by Nancy through " its infinite finishing ( or infinishing ) and not its finite perfection. ( n34 ) According to Nancy , art defines itself precisely through the vestigial , " infinishing , " nonessential : <p> The vestigial is not an essence -- and no doubt this is what puts us on the track of " the essence of art . " That art is today its own vestige , this is what opens us to it . It is not a degraded presentation of the Idea , nor the presentation of a degraded Idea ; it presents what is not " Idea " : motion , coming , passage , the going-on of coming-to-presence. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned , which Nauman and Beckett both insist on , pointing always to the end , traversing it but never arriving there , a perpetual nonpenetration " without breaking the ice or the mirror . " ( n36 ) Steven Connor discusses this compulsive relishing of the ending 's immanence in Beckett , citing the last passage from Ill Seen , Ill Said : <p> Farewell to farewell . Then in that perfect dark foreknell darling sound pip for end begun . First last moment . Grant only enough remain to devour all . Moment by glutton moment . Sky earth the whole kit and boodle . Not another crumb of carrion left . Lick chops and basta . No . One moment more . One last . Grace to breathe that void . Know happiness. ( n37 ) <p> During End of the World , this is the promise of every silence that breaks the stream of steel-pedal guitar , the anticipation of " One moment more , " of the relishing of space within an " end begun , " so that end therefore resides at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of " The End of the World , " ( n39 ) Nancy , like Nauman , invokes not a dark apocalypse but a clarity of realization : that there is no " end " in the sense of determinable liquidation with its antipode of birth . In other words , no " once and for all , ' ... but the spacing of all onces. ' " ( n40 ) Brilliantly , Nauman and Beckett engender this finitude , folded within the structure of infinity , the uneventful displacements of " pure time . " And through this spacing , which enables a continual surging forth and retreat , enter End of the World , like Violent Incident , Quad , Footfalls , Wall-Floor Positions ... engaged in a rhythm . Nancy characterizes the perpetual progress ( not passage ) of the vestige 's infinite finishing in just such terms : <p> This rhythm comprises sequence and syncopation , trajectory and interruption , gait and gap , phase and spasm . It thereby cuts a figure , but this figure is not an image in the sense I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the vestige , is its tracing , its spacing. ( n41 ) ... and though it seemed to be outside him , before him , about him ... <p> And what if this spacing were to consist in beating one 's entire body against the corner of a wall , as Nauman did in his video Bouncing in the Corner ( 1968 ) ? The knock would signify , once again not someone at the door , but a collision of body and matter . This impact resonates in Nauman and Beckett . Sound produces the difficulty of existing among things , of having sense . In Beckett 's 1957 radio play All That Fall , considerable airtime is given to grunting and groaning , as the heavyset and rickety couple Maddy and Dan Rooney maneuver into cars , tip stairs , down roads. ( n42 ) Again , what makes the performance exhausting to hear is this strained effort , figured in a rhythm painfully maintained , as the Rooneys inch their way back from the train station toward their home . And prototypically for Beckett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Beckett 's 1976 stage play Footfalls , the disheveled , aged May speaks with or to an offstage voice accompanied by the sound of her own pacing , to and fro in the dark . While May paces , the single voice recites this schizophrenic narration : <p> The mother : What do you mean , May , not enough , what can you possibly mean , May , not enough ? May : I mean , Mother , that I must hear the feet , however faint they fall . The mother : The motion alone is not enough ? May : No , Mother , the motion alone is not enough , I must hear the feet , however faint they fall. ( n43 ) <p> Striking the ground , touching it is not enough . There must be an excess of sense , a vestige of movement which consists in this pulse , however faint , of pacing . Slightly different in dynamic , perhaps , from the slam of Wall-Floor Positions , the beat in both is never metronomic , but the irregular pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In describing the music of Schumann , Barthes describes such a rhythm , of pure violence , invested in the body that " speaks but says nothing . " ( n44 ) Of Schumann 's Kreisleriana , Barthes writes , " No , what I hear are blows : I hear what beats in the body , what beats the body , or better : I hear this body that beats . " ( n45 ) Beating the body into music without the relay of a signifier , this is the power of Schumann 's rhythm , which explodes and rages , but never expresses . Similarly , if in Nauman 's tightly cropped loops of tape , a torso is extracted , a head lopped off , if on Beckett 's darkened stage only a mouth emerges , a cowled figure scurrying , a hooded lump , what bears the body into presence is this beating ( shuffling , slamming , bouncing ) that is at once the sense of touching or hearing something outside the body , and the vestige that points to the sense of having touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Schumann 's violent rhythm as madness . Incorporating this pulse , Nauman 's installation Learned Helplessness in Rats , Rock and Roll Drummer ( 1988 ) is a laboratory for just such destabilization , engaged here by the double accompaniment of a different sort of beat . On one wall , a video projection alternates , clicking regularly from shots of a rat in a Plexiglas maze , to live footage from a surveillance camera hovering in the room , to a recording of the drum session that produced the installation 's obnoxious sound track . Madness here , however , is not so much caused by the loudly pounding drum riffs , but by the tact that this noise , made somewhere and sometime else by the boy in the video , strikes the body immediately in this small room . What actually sets the viewer reeling is this constant shift , amplified by each mechanical click of the sequencer , switching the projection from prerecorded drummer/rat ( then ) to live surveillance footage ( now ) . With every shift Nauman strips away the moorings of past-present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tremble in between. ( n46 ) <p> Engaging this perpetual temporal implosion , Nauman pries apart the seam between now and then , the distance typically screened by the television set . Imposing a remote , other vision on a situated viewer , television creates what Samuel Weber refers to as " undecidability , " a condition that the screen itself simultaneously masks and marks. ( n47 ) Nauman wants to expose this " undecidability , " showing how television 's confusion of time also produces a confusion of substance , a sense of being -- as Weber notes -- " neither fully there , nor entirely here . " Appropriately then , while Nauman 's beat attacks before/after , it collapses inside/outside on the way . ... in his mind , he supposed , though he did not know exactly what that meant ... <p> In Beckett 's stage play Not I ( 1972 ) , a disembodied mouth , surrounded by black curtain , is slowly born into light , chattering faster and faster without skipping a beat , slowing only at the intermittent refrain of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ... she ! " ( n48 ) In Not I , constant bafflement , about what comes from within the mouth ( mind ) and what : bombards from without . The mouth struggles to keep pace with its own thoughts ( which it can not be sure are its own ) . ( n49 ) Nauman 's sixty-minute black-and-white video Lip Synch ( 1968 ) uses the same bodiless orifice , this time suspended upside down by the camera . What is most disturbing about Nauman 's mouth is the tempo of repronounced words , " Liiiip ... Sin .... k , " which almost seem to come from it , pronounced according to Barthes 's definition , wherein pronunciation emerges " from the depths of the body 's cavities , " manifesting the materiality of signifier-sounds , rubbing against the message in a kind of perverted friction. ( n50 ) We hear and see this grating in Lip Synch when the mouth closes and swallows after a tiring string of speech , when the throat clears itself of accumulated saliva , when the microphone pops with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ k/Most alarming about these sounds , however , is the fact that their synchronization with the mouth on-screen wavers , engendering a perpetual undecidability , as the embodied materiality of voice collides with the absence of a coherent body . <p> In Think ( 1993 ) , Nauman 's head bounces up and down on two television screens , one above the other , the camera tightly focused so that only the top of Nauman 's head comes into full view , with the occasional peep of mouth ostensibly chanting as he bounces , " Think ! Think ! Think ! " The laser-disc recordings are twinned , but once again not synchronized . The looped segments vary : a snowy image with sound distortion , " Think ! " punctuated by clashing cymbals , top screen upside down , bottom screen right side up , vice versa , and so on . What remains constantly clear is the initial impression : that it is difficult to match which voice to which bobbing head , that it is preposterous to follow the imperative " Think ! Think ! Think ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the echo that must , yet does not , seem to come from the on-screen/onstage fragment is a familiar discombobulating technique , one used in the romantic song : <p> ... what is suggested , what is here vocally put before us , is the anguish of something that threatens to divide , to separate , to dissociate , to dismember the body . The dark voice , voice of Evil or of Death , is a voice without site , a voice without origin : it resonates everywhere ... in every case , it no longer refers to the body , which is distanced in a kind of non-site. ( n51 ) <p> Nauman and Beckett are both expert in producing this voice without a site , afflicting a kind of sitelessness , described by Nauman in terms of an early corridor piece : <p> It had to do with going up the stairs in the dark , when you think there is one more step and you take the step , but you are already at the top ... or going down the stairs and expecting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom . It seems that you always have that jolt and it really throws you off . I think that when these pieces work they do that too. ( n52 ) <p> Playing on an expectation , that the sound will be sutured to the on-screen image , that it will come from a body , Nauman produces a jolt . In Think , shock and frustration are doubly pronounced as Nauman confounds this aural dislocation with an explicit mental sitelessness , making ridiculous the Hegelian notion of thought as a realm of pure interiority : <p> Thinking , however , results in thought alone ; it evaporates the form of reality into the form of the pure Concept , and even if it grasps and apprehends real things in their particular character and real existence , it nevertheless lifts even this particular sphere into the element of the universal and ideal wherein alone thinking is at home with itself .... Thinking is only a reconciliation between reality and truth within thinking itself . But poetic creation and formation is a reconciliation in the form of a real phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n53 ) <p> Nancy articulates an interruption in Hegel 's model , of art " conceived as the derived , external , and unseeing expression of the internal gaze of pure presence , " ( n54 ) and consequently of thinking , which could ever be alone " at home with itself . " Positing sense before signification , Nancy reverses the dialectic : " thought uses itself to touch ( to be touched by ) that which is not for it a " content " but its body : the space of this extension and opening in which and as which it exscribes itself , that is , lets itself be transformed into the concreteness or praxis of sense . " ( n55 ) For Nauman , like Nancy , to think touches on to jump , to crash cymbals , to scream , to hear . For Nancy , like Beckett , this process ( of thought touching its body ) is conceived as a step ( Footfalls , " Suspended Step " ) . <p> Trekking back to the mind/body problem , which Rosalind Krauss identifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound of Its Own Making ( 1961 ) , we recognize this same fracturing , whereby no substance is integral , whole . Morris 's Beckettian construction no doubt opens onto Nauman 's , also baffling the notion of founding origin , also tracing the closed circuit of consciousness everywhere to an outside line . The fiction of " internal discourse , " as attacked too by Derrida in 1969 ( " The Double Session " ) , is left perpetually under siege . Nonetheless , while mobilizing this estrangement , " exscription , " sitelessness , Beckett and Nauman still preserve the " concreteness " of sense , the specificities of situation . Their acoustic experiments have little to do with Artaud 's , as described by Denis Hollier . If Artaud would open theater to the noises of the street , " to leave the space of representation tot that , precisely of the event , " ( n56 ) by contrast Nauman and Beckett insist on the theatricality of their works , which only mimic events . For them , sound never breaks into an exterior world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of stage , screen , installation . Their works depend on a relentless specificity(n57) in line with Nancy 's , in which sense is not indiscriminately dispersed , but zoned , discrete . ... with the utmost formal distinctness ... <p> If film has been theorized as a visual art , menaced by what Hollis Frampton , for instance , would deem the synesthetic " monster " of sound , ( n58 ) Beckett 's directions for Film ( 1964 ) , consisting mostly of outlines and diagrams , are appropriately headed by the motto " Esse est percipi " ( n59 ) Originally titled The Eye , Film inflicts on Buster Keaton an " anguish of perceivedness " through successive camera angles from which Keaton , designated O ( the object ) , can not escape : " We 're trying to find a ... cinematic equivalent for visual appetite and visual distaste .. , a reluctant ... a disgusted vision O 's and a ferociously voracious one E's. " ( n60 ) As such , the film is silent , but not completely . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman turns to her companion , and " checks him with a gesture and soft sssh ! ' " film reverberates with this quiet exclamation echoing in silence , puncturing the circumference of film 's voracious eye with a gaping hole . <p> Addressing the attempt to stage a theater production of All That Fall , Beckett reacted harshly : <p> All That Fall is a specifically radio play , or rather radio text , for voices , not bodies . I have already refused to have it " staged " and I can not think of it in such terms .... It is no more theatre than End-Game is radio and to " act " it is to kill it . Even the reduced visual dimension it will receive from the simplest and most static of readings .. , will be destructive of whatever quality it may have and which depends on the whole thing 's coming out of the dark. ( n61 ) <p> When Beckett was proposed the transference of the stage play Act Without Words to film , he similarly replied , " If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or extricate them from the confusion that has them where they are , we might as well go home and lie down . " ( n62 ) Ironically , however , the very means that Beckett uses in order to keep his genres " more or less distinct " rely on a technique of studied confrontation , if not confusion . Writing about All That Fall , Linda Ben-Zvi describes Beckett 's method , which constantly thwarts the medium of radio , giving anything but the impression of another world constituted by sound in its entirety . Instead , the listener remains in wondering frustration , as Beckett issues cryptic clues , pointing mercilessly to the fact that one is sitting in the dark and wants to see what 's going on . Beckett 's medium consciousness resides , then , not in forming clear lines of demarcation but in creating constant friction , always implicating " other zones of sensing " in the manner of Nancy 's toucher : <p> Sensing and the sensing-oneself-sense that makes for sensing itself consists always in sensing at the same time that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are other zones of sensing , overlooked by the zone that is sensing at this moment , or else on which this zone touches on all sides but only at the limit where it ceases being the zone that it is. ( n63 ) <p> Beckett 's work relentlessly pursues these limits , moving increasingly toward a degree of dissolution . His formalism , therefore , could never be characterized as reductive , but more properly as explosive . As such , Quad I and H do not produce a distillation , an essence of what it is to be a television play . Indeed , they border so closely on dance that Beckett must plug the spill with a proclamation : the cowled figures are " mimes , " he says , " not dancers . " ( n64 ) In creating this tenuous structure , however , Beckett does not deny the medium 's essence . Rather , to use Nancy 's terms again , he " entrances " it , seduces it , transverses it. ( n65 ) <p> Like Beckett 's Film , Nauman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black-and-whites from 1969 , Black Balls , Bouncing Balls , Gauze , and Pulling Mouth , are silent . Nauman will also agree that " films are about seeing , " and as such he too will produce an anguish , this time of perceiving , straining vision in his painfully decelerated slow-mos , shot at one thousand to four thousand frames per second . His videotapes , on the other hand , will not utilize this form of distortion , profiting instead from the initially accidental effects of a wild track that stretches and tightens , causing sound to go in and out of synch . Nauman himself , of course , will sound far more cavalier about his use of materials : <p> But it was simple in that in the ' 60s you did n't have to pick just one medium . There did n't seem to be any problem with using different kinds of materials , shifting from photographs to dance to performance to videotapes . It seemed very straightforward to use all those different ways of expressing ideas or presenting material . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could make jokes about parts of the body or casting things , or whatever. ( n66 ) <p> Nauman thus refers to working in video , film , speaking as if it were a matter of convenience , not conviction . And his projects are undeniably invested in a kind of plurality without hierarchy : video , photograph , casting , neon sign , whatever . There is , nevertheless , in this seeming " anything goes " approach , an obsessively disciplined method , which recognizes as discrete " all those different ways of expressing . " As acutely as anyone , Nauman knows what it is to watch a screen , knows the expectations ( embodied voices , sutured sound-image ) , the rhythm ( repeated illusion of narrative ) , the circumstances ( somewhat private , somewhat not ) , the frustrations ( endless ) that attend a TV viewing . And Nauman , as madly as Beckett , will not desist in unraveling , in making and remaking , until the work resembles a Violent Incident : " I liked all this , keep taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Obviously , this method of dissection can never produce an autonomous body that one could frame and hang on the wall to look at , because it would be dripping , leaking . Neither , on the other hand , does it produce a space of nondifferentiation , of art in general . On this , Nancy writes , " However , there is no art ' in general : each one indicates the threshold by being itself also the threshold of another art . Each one touches the other without passing into it .... " ( n68 ) Art and sense still intact , defined by thresholds , by spacing . Art that knows itself by rubbing constantly , grating its surface against another " with the utmost formal distinctness .

@@4089341 Chocolate is not only a delectable treat all around the world , but a good example of an engineered food that has been designed and built industrially . Food scientists and engineers have learned to control the taste and flavor of chocolate , as well as its structure and thermal properties , so it has just the right texture and melts at just the right speed when we bite into it . </p> Industrially , the structure of chocolate is the result of a series of complex process operations , based on the trials and errors of thousands of cooks over hundreds of years . Today , we would like to be able to model how to create and modify that structure without so many trials and errors . </p> This represents a significant challenge , since molten chocolate is a complex non-Newtonian fluid , a material whose viscosity changes with the applied shear force . So are mayonnaise , peanut butter , egg whites , and also multigrade lubricants , molten polymers , and industrial slurries . </p> These liquids are much more difficult to model than Newtonian fluids like water . Nevertheless , some of the methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the food industry . </p> Understanding the mechanics and chemistry of chocolate production helps us design manufacturing processes and new types of products . It also makes it possible to find better ways to reduce fat and sugar content while retaining chocolate as an experience that people crave . Many of the lessons learned by working with chocolate can be applied to other foods to improve their taste and nutritional qualities to make better use of natural food resources in an increasingly hungry world . </p> Making Microstructured Foods The food industry has to produce products that people want to eat at a price they can afford . Foods are often physically complex fluids and soft solids , with rheological and material properties that are time- and process-dependent , and which have a natural variation . The microstructure of the material , at micrometer to millimeter scales , is critical to taste as well as nutrition . Creation of microstructure is very difficult to describe in engineering terms , but uses a combination of mechanical process such as mixing , heating , and cooling that act on the chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the baking of bread , the material starts as flour and water , which is mixed to create a Theologically complex multiphase mixture of air and dough . The viscosity of the dough changes by several orders of magnitude over about one minute , and the structure then becomes a solid . Building a model of this is very difficult , and there is still no efficient model that describes the creation of bread 's structure ; but as bread has been made efficiently for several thousand years , clearly the experiment has proven easier than theory . </p> Many emulsion-based foods share these same non-Newtonian properties and offer similar challenges to modeling . Margarines and spreads , for example , are made by combining shear and temperature . First shear creates the droplet structure , and then-chilling produces a continuous phase which is solid enough to prevent droplet ripening . ( Droplets ripen when their size changes over time , and this eventually causes the emulsion to break down . ) </p> To manufacture foods to meet consumer demands it is thus important to understand how structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : </p> * Breakdown in the mouth determines the taste , texture , and eating pleasure of each product . </p> * Breakdown in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract determines what nutrients are transferred to the body and at what rate . </p> To control breakdown , so that the food is optimal in the mouth and in digestion , requires a combined understanding of food chemistry and material science , together with knowledge of how processing affects food structure , chemistry , and attractiveness . This understanding can be exploited to make , for example , low-fat products whose microstructure produces a mouth feel similar to the original . </p> Heat Transfer in Chocolate Chocolate is a complex structured product , a mixture of a dispersed hydrophilic phase made of sugar and cocoa solids in a continuous fat matrix rich in cocoa butter . The fat crystal structure determines both the macroscopic and sensory properties of chocolate . </p> The manufacture of chocolate involves a series of controlled thermal processes . The engineering problem is that there are many different crystalline states of cocoa butter , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . These polymorphs ( traditionally numbered using Roman numerals I-VI ) have different crystal structures and melting points between 14 and 32 C ( 57-90F ) . </p> The form that is attractive to the consumer , and is thus desired by the manufacturer , is form V , which melts rapidly in the mouth . Form V also has attractive mechanical and optical properties , giving chocolate a glossy surface and the ability to fracture . In addition , this form is easy to manufacture , as the chocolate sets in such a way that it readily demolds at the end of the process . </p> But it is not the thermodynamically stable form -- which can be seen when chocolate is heated and then cooled . As it cools , it " blooms , " that is , the cocoa butter separates from the rest of the material to yield a mottled , phase-separated form . This is not only unattractive in appearance , but it forms crystals that do not melt at body temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold commercially is thus kinetically trapped . To make form V efficiently requires either the addition of seed crystals or a complex series of heating and shear processes that temper chocolate so it will solidify into the correct form . </p> Tempering is central to chocolate making . Shear and temperature are applied to the chocolate to create nuclei of the right form . </p> The liquid chocolate is then either poured into molds or poured in a curtain to cover the centers of chocolate bars . Conventional processing methods use slow cooling tunnels , reducing temperatures by 1-2 C per minute , which allows correctly tempered chocolate to set into the form required by the consumer . </p> Conventional solidification of chocolate has been extensively studied using differential scanning calorimetry , which involves measuring the heat flow required to melt or solidify the material . The combination of shear and time causes the polymorphic form to change from one which will result in untempered chocolate to one which gives the correct form . </p> For instance , data show that below some shear rate the material switches from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stable tempered chocolate in the final product , to one that melts at 13 C , which will result in unstable and untempered chocolate . This type of process can be modeled relatively simply using conventional computational heat transfer programs if data for the variation of effective specific heat capacity , C , measured by differential scanning calorimetry as a function of cooling rate , are used in the thermal conduction equation </p> chocolate START TO FINISH </p> pre-formatted table For conventional cooling rates of 1-3 C /min. , this approach is sufficient to model cooling rates and does not require kinetic data for the rate of crystallization . But what happens if we want to cool our chocolate at faster rates ? This approach fails at higher cooling rates , and we require both kinetic and thermal data . </p> ' Frozen Come ' Processing Yet there is at least one exception to the rule that chocolate must cool slowly . Recently , processes have been developed that use cooling rates of tens of degrees per second for short times . Such processes include the manufacturing of thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often filled later . Known as the frozen cone process , it involves the short application ( typically 3 seconds ) of a cold plunger ( held at about -20 C ) to shape the product to the required geometry , followed by traditional cooling tunnels . Conventional theory suggests that this should not produce a tempered product . Since the products are widely sold , the theory clearly needs modifying . </p> To explain how this can happen it is necessary to develop some kinetic understanding of the processes . At the University of Birmingham 's Centre for Formulation Engineering , we cooled and heated chocolate through rapid programmed temperature changes and then studied what happened using differential scanning calorimetry . </p> We fitted the data to six kinetic processes . To make the.modeling easier , the system of six polymorphs and liquid chocolate was simplified to model only three materials : stable solids , unstable solids , and melt . The stable solids are chocolate polymorphs that will lead to the correct final product , while the unstable solids are polymorphs that will lead to untempered chocolate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , growth of stable and unstable phases , and the melting of the stable and unstable solids . </p> The model simplifies the number of crystal forms , but this simplification makes it possible to model differential scanning calorimetry data . Once fitted to differential scanning calorimetry data over a range of cooling rates , the model can then be used both to predict behaviour and to explain what is happening in the process . </p> The model can be used to show how ' frozen cone ' methods work . The thermal conductivity of chocolate is so low that the layer of chocolate affected by the short cooling stage -- and cooled into the untempered form -- is only a few hundred micrometers thick . Most of the material cools at the slow rates required to make conventionally tempered product . Much of the untempered material in that thin , flash-frozen layer transforms into a tempered structure after it is reheated by heat transfer from the rest of the chocolate , which was not affected by the frozen cone . </p> For chocolate processors , this is valuable information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different chocolate products . Using the validated numerical model , we could estimate the time required to solidify the chocolate for different processing geometries and temperatures . </p> Research Challenges Overall , food processes are commonplace , but not well understood . They involve a large number of engineering processes . Improving the efficiency of these processes will create safer , healthier , and more sustainable foods . The challenge for the scientist and engineer is to understand the interaction between processing and structure , so we can control the taste and nutrient delivery of our products . </p> We have described work on chocolate that can be used to explain industrial processes , but we also could have discussed the design of baking or margarine processes . The engineering model makes it easier to understand existing processes and to design new ones . </p> Frozen cone technology ( far left ) can produce an entire assortment of chocolates in a single cycle . A frozen cone ( left ) close up . Rapid chilling ( below ) rapidly freezes chocolate into a hollow shape . It is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional chocolates . </p> The structure of the product is important both in enhancing consumer response ( as taste and mouth feel ) and in providing nutrition ( by delivery to the stomach and GI tract ) . Little is known about the processes of digestion and the best way to deliver food to the body . Eating and digestion constitute a complex mixing and reaction problem that has not been widely studied by engineers . Yet this type of understanding is needed to enable rational design of better foods , and to design materials that deliver the right molecule at the right time . </p> Work at University of Birmingham described here was carried out as part of projects funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council , the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , and the Technology Strategy Board of the U.K. The research received industrial support from Cadbury , Magna Ltd. , Campden BRI , Heineken , Unilever , and others .

@@4080641 Considering the coping effect and health connections of diary-keeping behaviour , the purpose of the present study was to investigate diary-keeping in relation to happiness and gender among Turkish teacher trainees . A sample of 417 teacher trainees between the ages of 18 and 29 was surveyed . Happiness was considered as consisting of positive and negative affect and life satisfaction . The results revealed mostly dissatisfaction with life among Turkish teacher trainees . Females reported more negative affect than males do . Although no significant relationships were found between happiness and diary-keeping , gender differences in diary-keeping behaviour were found in favour of females . Key Words : teacher trainees ; diary-keeping ; happiness ; culture 1 . Introduction Improving the personal development of teacher trainees is as important as improving their content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge during their pre-service years . Considering the role of teachers in the intellectual , emotional , social , and spiritual development of their students , administrators , curriculum planners , instructors and counsellors working with teacher trainees are primarily expected to contribute to the personal development of teacher trainees before starting to serve as teachers and role models for their students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested in contributing to the personal development of teacher trainees face within the recent literature . Happy teacher trainees , those who are satisfied with their lives , experience frequent joy , and infrequent unpleasant emotions such as anger and sadness , are supposed to engage more in intellectual and personal activities , which in turn enhances their total development through their pre-service years . Moreover , happy teacher trainees are supposed to become happy teachers in the future . Considering the characteristics of happy people mentioned in the literature , investigating diary-keeping behaviour among teacher trainees seem crucial , since keeping a diary has the potential to contribute to self-discovery and personal development . Moreover , diary-keeping is a self-initiated coping behaviour ( Burt , 1994a , 1994b ) that may cause or affect happiness . 1.1 . Studies on happiness As a result of the positive paradigm in the field of psychology ( Seligman &; Csikszentmihalyi , 2000 ) , the investigation of happiness has attracted attention since the middle of the twentieth century . Happiness has been investigated especially by using the term subjective well-being ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life satisfaction ( the cognitive aspect ) , the presence of positive affect , and the absence of negative affect ( the affective aspects ) ( Diener , 1984 ; Diener , Suh , &; Oishi , 1997 ; Myers &; Diener , 1995 ) . Over the years , several studies have examined the correlates of happiness , revealing weak relationships with demographic variables such as education , ethnic status , and age ( Campbell , Convers , &; Rodgers , 1976 ) but very strong positive relationships with some psychological characteristics such as self-esteem ( Ayyash-Abdo &; Alamuddin , 2007 ; Diener , et al. , 1995 ) , optimism ( Aspinwall &; Taylor , 1992 ; Lucas , Diener , &; Suh , 1996 ; Scheier &; Carver , 1992 ) , extraversion ( Diener , et al. , 1992 ) , personal control ( Larson , 1989 ) , and fulfilling one 's goals ( Emmons , 1996 ; Ryan et al. , 1996 ) . National and cultural differences in happiness were especially underlined in the literature ( Diener , Suh , Oishi , &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oishi &; Diener , 2001 ) , indicating that , in economically developed wealthier countries where people possesses greater freedom and human rights , and where an emphasis on individualism exists , people reported a higher degree of subjective well-being . According to Diener and Suh ( 2003 ) , people in individualistic nations report higher degrees of self-fulfilment than people in collectivist nations , due to their freedom in following their own interests and desires , as occurs in individualistic cultures . Nevertheless , less social support during troubled periods increases the suicide and divorce rates in individualistic nations . Therefore , although more common in individualistic cultures , extreme levels of happiness are not prevalent among collectivists since they have a safer cultural structure . Moreover , as stated by Diener and Suh ( 2003 ) , some nations appeared to be more emotional than others . For instance , although the citizens of Turkey and Japan had about the same life satisfaction and hedonic balance scores , Turks reported much higher levels of pleasant and unpleasant affect . Hence , considering cultural differences is important in studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in studies of happiness . Several studies reported inconsistent findings on gender differences in happiness . For instance , some studies revealed a trend toward women 's reporting greater experience and expression of positive moods than men ( Nolen-Hoeksema , &; Rusting , 2003 ; Wood , Rhodes , &; Whelan , 1989 ) , whereas some others stated that men have a slight tendency toward higher positive affection ( Haring , Stock , &; Okun , 1984 ) . A sample of Lebanese adolescents , Ayyash-Abdo ( 2003 ) reported higher negative emotion scores for female adolescents than for male adolescents . Gender differences have been explained using biological , personality , and social context factors ( Nolen-Hoeksema , &; Rusting , 2003 ; Perneger , Hudelson , &; Bovier , 2004 ) . In addition , Diener and friends ( 1991 ) reported that the effect of social desirability bias among females resulted in their " overstating " their level of happiness . Additionally , happiness was found to be related with the coping styles of individuals . While happy people tend to engage in effective ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from others , and seeing the bright side of events , unhappy people tend to use passive or inefficient styles such as engaging in fantasy , avoiding working on problems , and blaming others and themselves ( McCrae &; Costa , 1986 ) . Keeping a diary is a self-initiated coping behaviour ( Burt , 1994a , 1994b ) and hence may cause or affect happiness . Although the literature points to many physical and psychological benefits of written self-expression behaviour , the relationship between happiness and keeping a diary is still unknown . 1.2 . Studies on written disclosure People may express their thoughts and feelings in a meaningful and personal way through writing , and they may gain a sense of control due to the expression of those thoughts and feelings in a confidential manner ( Mazza , 2003 ) . They may learn about themselves through writing about the important things in their lives -- their goals , achievements , etc. -- in a diary . Additionally , some studies have indicated that writing about traumatic experiences brings about comparable changes to talking to psychotherapists among psychologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lamnin , &; Carver , 1989 ) . The therapeutic value of writing about experiences have been widely emphasised in the literature , indicating significant mental and physical health improvements in different age groups after individuals write expressively about emotional experiences . For instance , several studies have found that participants who write down their deepest thoughts and emotions about significant events show increased general health and well-being ( Pennebaker , 1997 ) , reduced medical visits ( Pennebaker &; Beall , 1986 ) , fewer days absent from school , improved liver enzyme function ( Francis &; Pennebaker , 1992 ) , increased academic achievement ( Cameron &; Nicholls , 1998 ) , better immune function ( Esterling , et al. , 1994 ) , a decrease in upper respiratory symptoms , tension , or fatigue , a tendency to reunite with ex-partners after a breakup ( Lepore &; Greenberg , 2002 ) , and decreased sleep onset latency ( Harvey &; Farrel , 2003 ) . Stress and anxiety were also found to be reduced following written emotional expression ( Ireland , Malouf , &; Byrne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burt , 1994b ) . Nevertheless , the existing literature calls attention to the effect of gender on the benefits of writing , indicating more benefits for males after writing interventions ( Manier &; Olivares , 2005 ; Smyth , 1998 ) . These results are explained by gender differences in emotional expressiveness . The tendency among males toward not expressing emotions with words but rather with their behaviours ( e.g. , Bruch , 2002 ; Goldsmith &; Weller , 2000 ; Brody , 2000 ; Tylor et al. , 2000 ; Kring &; Gordon , 1998 ; Guttman &; Laporte , 2002 ) , and the self-confidence among females regarding verbal expressions of emotion ( Blier &; Blier-Wilson , 1989 ) , are well-known . Different from designed writing interventions , diary-keeping is a self-initiated behaviour people engage in , a writing activity without special encouragement by anyone ( such as a counsellor or other mental health professional ) . Hence , there might be as many different kinds of diaries as there are diarists ( Bolton , 1999 ) . Besides , keeping a diary appears in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is possible to keep a diary by using computer programs that are designed specifically for this purpose . People who may prefer the spoken word rather than the written word may keep audio diaries/journals . Also , through access to the internet , personal storytelling becomes possible via online journaling and blog writing . In any case , a diary is a very personal thing designed to be read only by the writers unless they decide otherwise , and which therefore can not be criticised as being right or wrong . Therefore , people could benefit from very different kinds of diaries . Although the many benefits of writing on mental and physical health mentioned below should be taken into consideration when one is investigating the effects of diary-keeping behaviours of teacher trainees , findings associated with previous research that focused specifically on diary-keeping behaviour have a special importance for the present study . The most striking findings regarding diary-keeping behaviours underlined the effects of gender and developmental stage . Gender was found to be related with the prevalence of diary-keeping behaviour . For instance , Burt ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian student sample ( N=52 ) , and 77.2% of the females ( N=145 ) , were diarists . In two other surveys conducted on university students , Burt ( 1994a ) replicated these findings . According to the results of his first survey , 32% of the males and 72.6% of the females reported keeping a diary at the time of the survey or having kept a diary in past . Similarly , in his second survey , 67.7% of males and 90.9% of female subjects reported keeping a diary at the time of the survey or having kept a diary in past . The motive for diary-keeping behaviour was also found to differ across gender groups . Males tend to keep a diary as an aid in recalling past and future events , while females use diaries for emotional expression . Hence , gender appears to be both a predictor and a motive for diary-keeping ( Burt , 1994a ) . In addition to gender differences , the existing literature also revealed the effects of developmental stage on the prevalence of diary-keeping behaviour . Associated with the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiological changes , sexuality , and opposite-sex relationships during adolescence , diary-keeping seems particularly prevalent during this period of life ( Burt , 1994a ) . Moreover , studies on American introductory psychology students indicated that about half of the students reported they were diarists ( Rubin , 1982 , Thomson , 1982 ) . These findings were replicated in a more recent study on Australian university students ( Burt , 1994a ) . However , whether these findings remain valid in nonwestern countries is still a challenging topic . 1.3 . The present study Considering all the research findings mentioned above , an investigation of the happiness level of Turkish teacher trainees in relation to their diary-keeping behaviours is supposed to contribute to the interventions that cultivate the personal and professional development of this group . Although diary-keeping behaviour as a self-initiated coping strategy has the potential to contribute the happiness levels of teacher trainees , the relationship between happiness and diary-keeping is still a little-known area , since few studies have examined diary-keeping as a coping style . Moreover , whether western findings on happiness and diary-keeping will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter for question , since Turkey is an economically developing country in a transition period between protecting its basically collectivist nature and increasingly reflecting western individualistic characteristics ( Aydin-Mocan , 2007 ) . Therefore , with the aim of examining the happiness levels of Turkish teacher trainees in relation to self-initiated coping-style diary-keeping , and in the light of the existing happiness and diary-keeping literatures , the answers to the following questions were examined in the present study : What is the prevalence of DKB among Turkish teacher trainees ? If they prefer to express themselves by writing their emotions and ideas in personal diaries , who are these diarist teacher trainees ? Can we say that they are females more often than males ? Or can we say that they are significantly more or less happy than the non-diarists ? 2 . Methods 2.1 . Participants The sample included 457 teacher trainees , aged 18-29 with a mean of 20.41 , attending different departments of the faculty of education of Uludag University , at the time of the data collection in November 2007 . Uludag is a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most economically developed region , but it accepts students from all around the country . For the sample of the present study , freshmen were not included to av6id the possible effects of the transition period that takes place in the first year of undergraduate programs . 2.2 . Measures In the present study , happiness is considered as consisting of negative and positive affect and satisfaction with life . Hence , two measures were used for happiness : negative and positive affect measured by PANAS , and satisfaction with life measured by SWLS . Participants were also given a demographic questionnaire , which was designed to ask for basic demographic information and explore the diary-keeping behaviours ( DKB ) of participants . 2.3 . Measure of positive and negative affect The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ) was developed by Watson , Clark , and Telegen ( 1988 ) as a measure of affective evaluation of life . The instrument includes 10 positive and 10 negative items , which are added together within each sub-scale to determine score for positive and negative affect . Positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person feels enthusiastic , active , and alert . High PA indicates a state of high energy , full concentration , and pleasurable engagement , whereas low PA is characterised by sadness and lethargy . In contrast , Negative Affect ( NA ) is a general dimension of subjective distress and unpleasurable engagement that subsumes a variety of aversive mood states , including anger , contempt , disgust , guilt , fear , and nervousness , with low NA being a state of calmness and serenity ( p.1063 ) . Different scores can be obtained from the scale according to different timeframes ( moment , today , past few days , year , or general ) . Both PA and NA subscales of PANAS , as well as a general timeframe , were used to measure the moods of the students in the present study . Participants were asked to indicate " how you feel in general " on a 5-point response scale from 1 ( very slightly ) to 5 ( extremely ) . PANAS has been reported to have good internal consistency , with positive and negative affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Watson et al . 1988 ) . The adaptation of the scale to Turkish was made by Genz ( 2000 ) . She reported that , consistent with the original study , the results of the factor analysis revealed two factors accounting for 44% of the total variance , and that internal consistencies for PA and NA were .83 and .86 , respectively . In the present study , the alpha coefficients for PA and NA were found to be .74 and .79 , respectively , indicating sufficient internal consistency . 2.4 . Measure of satisfaction with life The Satisfaction with Life Scale ( SWLS ; Deiner , et al , 1985 ) is a five-item scale that measures the cognitive evaluation of one 's life satisfaction . Each item is scored from 1 to 7 , " strongly disagree " to " strongly agree . " Item scores are added together to attain a total score , which ranges from 5 to 35 , with higher scores reflecting more satisfaction with life . The internal consistency of the scale was .87 , and the test-retest reliability for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Smer ( 1996 ) translated the scale into Turkish and reported satisfactory internal consistency ( a = .89 ) . In the present study , the alpha coefficient was found to be .76. 2.5 . Demographic data form This was a 10-item demographic questionnaire that was developed by the researcher to gather information about basic demographics ( age , gender , department , class ) and DKB . In the present study , the word " diary " refers to the expression of personal information in a written format . Although in English sometimes the word " journal " is used for " diary " , a journal is differentiated from a diary with regard to the frequency of writing , since generally one writes daily in a diary but less frequently in a journal . In daily Turkish , the word " gnlk " is the equivalent to " diary " , and has been used both for daily and for less frequent writings . In terms of DKB , teacher trainees were asked to choose the best option to describe themselves among the three categories ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a diarist currently ) . Teacher trainees in two separate diary-keeping categories ( past diarists and current diarists ) were also asked the duration of their diary-keeping. 2.6 . Procedure Students completed anonymous , classroom-administered questionnaires on a selected day . The instructions written on the cover page of the scales were read to the entire class . Those who volunteered to participate were given relevant directions about the completion of the test , and they were asked to be honest when responding to the test items . The administration of the questionnaires took about 15 minutes . Anonymity was guaranteed . 3 . Results 3.1 . Description of sample Before conducting the analyses , the data was examined in terms of the duration of diary-keeping behavior , and 78 students were omitted from the data because of their very short-lived ( 2 months and below ) diary-keeping . Among the rest of the participants , since no one reported diary-keeping between 2 and 6 months , all the teacher trainees who are or were diarists reported at least 6 months ' diary-keeping behavior . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking into consideration Mahalonobis distance . Consequently , two students were removed from the data because they exceeded the critical value ( 16.27 for this study ) . Thus , the final sample consisted of 377 students . Their mean age was 20.43 years ( SD=1.56 , range : 18-29 ) . Descriptive analysis indicated that 69.2% of the students ( 261 ) were female , whereas 30.8% ( 116 ) were males . The proportion of students who reported " never having been a diarist " , " being a diarist in the past " or " being a diarist currently " was analysed . 159 students ( 42.2% ) reported keeping a diary in the past , 42 students ( 11.1% ) reported keeping a diary currently , and 176 students ( 46.7% ) had never kept a diary . Furthermore , the mean scores were found to be 48.74 ( SD= 7.12 ) , 32.83 ( SD= 6.94 ) , and 14.04 ( SD=.76 ) for the PA , NA , and SWLS scores , respectively . The means , standard deviations , and sample sizes across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Table 1 . As seen in Table 1 , the PA scores for the total sample were higher than the NA scores . Both females and males reported higher PA scores than NA scores . Moreover , mean differences were detected , especially in the PA and NA scores of current female and male diarists . Current female diarists scored higher both on PA and on NA than current male diarists and the other two female DKB groups did , whereas current male diarists scored lower than the current female diarists and the other two male DKB groups . Finally , the mean of the SWLS scores of males who had never kept a diary is lower than the mean of the SWLS scores of all other male and female DKB groups . The SWLS scores of the trainees were below the neutral point ( 20 ) on this scale . As a result , whether these differences are statistically significant was examined through further analyses . 3.2 . Results regarding the relationships between happiness and DKB First , Pearson 's product moment correlation coefficients were calculated to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of the bivariate correlations among the variables are presented in Table 2 . As seen in Table 2 , low correlations were found among all the three dependent variables ( PA , NA , LS ) of the study . Additionally , no significant relationship was found between DKB and the dependent variables . Thereafter , chi-square analysis was conducted to compare gender groups with reference to the three categories ( never , in the past , currently ) of DKB . The analysis revealed a significant relationship between gender and DKB . Both among females ( 14.6% ) and among males ( 3.4% ) , DKB at the present time was rare . However , most of the males ( 78.4% ) reported no DKB during their lifetime , whereas this proportion was 32.6 percent among females . Similarly , only 18.1% of the males reported having kept a diary in the past , whereas 52.9% of the females reported diary-keeping in the past . In general , DKB occurred more commonly among females than among males . This information is summarised in Table 3. 3.3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NA , and LS A two-way multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) was performed to investigate the effects of diary-keeping behaviour and gender on the three dependent variables of the study . Preliminary assumption testing was conducted to check for normality , linearity , univariate and multivariate outliers , homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices , and multi-collinearity , with no serious violations noted . Results indicated a significant difference between males and females for the combined dependent variables F ( 3,369 ) = 2.63 , p=.05 . Considering the results for dependent variables separately , this difference was seen in the NA scores IF ( 1,371 ) =5.21 , p=.023 ) of the students . An inspection of the mean scores indicated that females reported slightly higher levels of negative affect than males . However , no significant DKB effect F ( 6,738 ) =.855 , p=.528 , and no significant DKB X gender interaction effect F ( 6,738 ) = 1.50 , p=.175 , was found . To reduce the chance of a Type 1 error , a Bonferroni adjustment was applied by dividing alpha level .05 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p.402 ) . Since there were 3 dependent variables in the present study , dividing .05 by 3 , it was decided to consider the results significant only if the probability value was less than .017 . Consequently , when the results for the dependent variables were considered separately using a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of .017 , no difference reached statistical significance . In other words , neither gender nor DKB has a significant effect on PA , NA , or SWLS . The dependent variables were also not affected by the interaction of gender and DKB. 4 . Discussion Considering the previously mentioned national and cultural differences in terms of happiness , and the lack of research on the diary-keeping behaviours of teacher trainees , the present study was the first to investigate happiness in relation to the self-initiated coping behaviour of diary-keeping and gender among Turkish teacher trainees . The results revealed meaningful insights regarding the satisfaction with life , emotions , and diary-keeping behaviours of Turkish teacher trainees . In terms of life satisfaction , Turkish teacher trainees were below the neutral point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their lives ( as consistent with the previous findings on national and cultural differences in happiness ) ( Diener , Suh , Oishi , &; Triandis , 1998 ; Pavot &; Diener , 1993 ; Oishi &; Diener , 2001 ) . In general , the lack of some factors previously emphasised in the literature as determinants of higher levels of happiness in life , such as wealth , economic development , greater freedom , and individualism , might be used as possible explanations for this dissatisfaction . However , the reasons for dissatisfaction deserve to become the focus of future research to provide detailed information for administrators , curriculum planners , instructors and counsellors working with Turkish teacher trainees . Additionally , the results revealed that Turkish teacher trainees experience relatively more positive affect than negative affect in their lives . This finding was expectedly consistent with the findings of earlier research using the same measures ( e.g. , Ayyash-Abdo &; Alamuddin , 2007 ; Diener , Suh , et al. , 1995 ; Lucas , Diener , &; Suh , 1996 ) , since positive feelings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported more negative affect , such as feeling anxious , hurt , or tense , than their male counterparts did , as consistent with the findings of Ayyash-Abdo ( 2003 ) on Lebanese adolescents . This finding gives rise to thoughts regarding socio-cultural effects on females . Turkish culture may affect females ' attitudes toward negative life experiences and emotional expressions via gender roles and stereotypes . Regarding diary-keeping , consistent with the literature on the generality of diary-keeping behaviour in the lives of young people ( Burt , 1994a ; Rubin , 1982 ; Thomson , 1982 ) , the findings revealed that over half of the students reported themselves as diarists . Among the diarists , the majority reported keeping a diary in the past , which extended through their adolescence years . Although diary-keeping decreases in the university years , diarists still seem to be considerable among teacher trainees . Therefore , in light of the findings of the present study , counsellors working with teacher trainees could take the familiarity of the trainees with diaries into consideration and take advantage of student diaries as a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their everyday lives without being given a special encouragement by anyone ( such as a counsellor or another professional ) may assume to be disposed to use these diaries in the counselling process if necessary . Moreover , this does not just affect the counsellors who are providing services for teacher trainees ; knowing about diary-keeping behaviours might also shed light on outdoor and experiential educators . Nevertheless , the results of this study point to gender differences in diary-keeping behaviour . Although diary writing seems to be a common practice of female teacher trainees , diarists seem quite rare among male teacher trainees . A very limited amount of the males reported keeping a diary in the past , which extended to their adolescence years . This amount appeared to decrease even more for the university years . The obtained proportions of diary-keeping among male teacher trainees also seem very low compared to the proportions obtained from western male samples ( Burt , 1994a , 1994b ) . This finding attracts attention to the distance of male Turkish teacher trainees from written emotional expression . However , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with words but rather through their behaviour ( c.f. Bruch , 2002 ; Goldsmith &; Weller , 2000 ; Brody , 2000 ; Tylor et al. , 2000 ; Kring &; Gordon , 1998 ; Guttman &; Laporte , 2002 ) , it was not surprising in the present study to see an enormous group of non-diarist males ; considering that teacher trainees constitute the higher intellectual class in this society , the proportions of non-diarists exceed expectations . Since keeping a diary is a way of expressing oneself through in written form , it was thought that boys who do n't prefer to express themselves through words also do n't prefer to express themselves by writing in a diary . However , using such an occasionally preferred activity in the personal development processes of teacher trainees might be beneficial , considering the findings indicating more benefits for males after writing interventions ( Manier &; Olivares , 2005 ; Smyth , 1998 ) . Since several studies in the literature revealed the physical and mental health benefits of writing on people ( e.g. , Burt , 1994b ; Cameron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Ireland , Malouf , &; Byrne , 2006 ; Pennebaker &; Beall , 1986 ) it was expected that we would find an effect of journal writing on the affect and life satisfaction of teacher trainees . Taking the mean scores into consideration , which reveal that current female diarists reported experiencing more positive and negative emotions than current male diarists and the other two female groups ( whereas current male diarists reported experiencing lesser positive and negative emotions than current female diarists and the other two male groups did ) , diary-keeping behaviours seems to increase emotionality among females while decreasing emotionality among males . Moreover , according to the descriptive statistics , nondiarist males scored lowest on life satisfaction , giving rise to the thought that the more they hesitate in terms of written expression , the less satisfied they become with life , or vice versa . However , the differences in mean scores did not reach a statistically significance in multivariate statistics . Therefore , the findings inhibit us from telling much about the relationships among diary-keeping behaviour , gender , and happiness . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that males who have never kept a diary ( non-diarist males ) constituted the less satisfied group among all teacher trainees , the possible effects of diary-keeping behaviours on happiness in different gender groups require further investigation in future studies . Moreover , considering today 's many different forms of diaries , future research could explore the demographic and personal characteristics of diarist teacher trainees under the sway of the development in technology in the modern world . Finally , some limitations should be noted in the interpretation and the generalisation of the findings of the present study . First , the fact that the sample was recruited from faculty of education students at a Turkish state university might have been a limitation in terms of the ability to generalise the conclusions for all teacher trainees in Turkey . In order to reflect the characteristics of the general Turkish university students , further research may include teacher trainees from other universities in Turkey . As a second limitation of this study , the measurement of diary-keeping behaviour relied on two items . The students were asked to categorise themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diarist , diarist in the past , current diarist ) and then report the duration of diary-keeping behaviour for both past and present . Asking about the content of the diaries in detail could be recommended for further studies in order to attain a better understanding of the nature of teacher trainees ' diaries and whether the content causes or affects happiness . Just knowing about whether someone is a diarist or not seems not to be enough to mention regarding his/her happiness . However , knowing about whether one writes in order to work on problems or life goals , to blame oneself or others for problem situations , or just to organise life and for memory purposes might help to predict one 's level of happiness .

@@4119041 Based on NAEP data , many adolescents may not be adequately prepared for postsecondary education . This is a Year Five report from a seven-year longitudinal study of a student cohort starting in sixth grade year ( n=50 ) . It uses a quasi-experimental design , and collects data from surveys , interviews , and reflective statements to evaluate mentoring strategies and outcomes . Year Five findings suggest that improvements in students ' college perceptions , state mandated test scores , and high school perseverance may be associated with mentor-led initiatives including college visits , goal setting , tutoring , career investigations , role model presentations , writing projects , and presentations about college preparation and life . </p> Reports on the educational attainment of adults and on the college readiness of adolescents provide disturbing news , particularly regarding African-Americans and Hispanic students . Recent data about high school graduation rates indicate that nationally , about 71 percent of all students graduate from high school on time with a regular diploma , but barely half of African-American and Hispanic students earn diplomas with their peers ( Sum , 2009 ) . Each year approximately 1.2 million students fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are categorized as in minority groups ( Diplomas Count , 2009 ) . Students who drop out of high school may have a grim economic future . According to Swanson ( 2003 ) only one-third ( 37 percent ) of high school dropouts nationwide are steadily employed , and they are more than twice as likely to live in poverty . </p> Trends in college readiness education attainment among adolescents are discouraging . Recent NAEP academic achievement reports ( National Assessment Governing Board , n.d. ) indicate only small percentages of eighth graders rank within the ' at or above proficient ' category for various subject areas and a significant gap exists so that Hispanic and African-American groups underachieve when compared to other population groups . The reading , math , and science NAEP scores of young adolescents and the current drop-out rates force the question : how many wiII be ready for college in four years ? Overall the gap in education preparation among Whites , Hispanics , and Blacks , as evident in their scaled scores , will result in many minority students being poorly prepared for higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LITERATURE The need to begin preparation for post-secondary education during middle school has been recognized for a long time , funded nationally , and supported at state and local levels . The literature includes articles , handbooks and guidelines for this process , and calls to action in the case of minority and underserved populations . </p> PLANNING TRANSITION FOR COLLEGE STARTING IN THE MIDDLE GRADES </p> The Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Program ( GEAR UP ) was created in 1998 and provides college-planning activities and related information to students , typically starting in middle school , and helps build relationships among school districts , colleges , and other community stakeholders . Based on site visits to 20 GEAR UP partnerships and descriptive information from 1 8 schools , Muraskin ( 2003 ) reported that tutoring was the most common type of support . In their " Year 4 " baseline report , conducted in north-central West Virginia , Finch and Cowley ( 2003 b ) summarized that tenth graders ' postsecondary plans had been positively influenced by the GEAR UP program . </p> The Federal TRIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared similar academic preparation goals with GEAR UP . TRIO , originally named this because it offered three programs , now includes eight outreach and support programs designed to help low-income , first-generation college students and students who have disabilities , progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to post-baccalaureate programs . </p> Predating GEAR UP are many state and locally funded programs such as Michigan 's Project Awareness and Baltimore 's Early Guidance Model . Flores ( 1993 ) reported that the goal of this Michigan program was to heighten students ' post-secondary aspirations through five interventions . Baltimore City Schools ' Early Guidance Model ( Gray , 1986 ) for middle/junior high school students supported this early post-secondary planning goal and extended it to elementary level students , suggesting that at an early age children need academic encouragement and need to envision going to college . Calls to action concerning the educational needs of minority and underserved populations have been raised for decades . Camblin ( 2003 ) described concerns about underserved students not attending college at the same rate as their White , middle- , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lack of opportunity for underserved students starting in middle school . </p> The " Creating a College Culture Project " ( McClafferty , McDonough , &; Nunez , 2002 ) emerged from concerns about the declining number of college-bound students from a southern California cluster of 24 schools that were ethnically and racially diverse . McClafferty recommended that schools should create a " college culture " : a school culture that encourages all students to consider college by introducing information about higher education opportunities during early adolescence and in high school . This concept of creating a college culture among diverse adolescents , many who are considered " at-risk " of not graduating from high school , underlies our current project which uses mentoring as a key strategy to support at risk students during their middle school and high school years . </p> MENTORING DURING MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL Mentoring , the foundation for creating a college culture in our study , was initiated with a cohort of students in their sixth grade and has supported them from sixth through their current year , tenth grade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ference and Rhodes ( 2002 ) , describing a program very similar to our project , report that a mentoring program for at-risk middle school students at a professional development school site using preservice teachers enrolled in methods classes improved the grades of two-thirds of the young students and was a positive experience for the mentors . Herrera , Vang , and Gale ( 2002 ) investigated three mentoring programs for middle school students and report associated improvements in students ' academic performance and attitudes . </p> After evaluating the impact of mentoring on middle and high school student achievement , attendance , and behavior , Illig ( 1999 ) cautiously suggested that academic mentoring may provide some benefits for children and concludes that additional research is needed . In our study , the cohort of students was mentored by preservice teachers in a variety of educational activities that help create a college culture . Highlights from these mentoring activities include the mentor helping to guide college visits each year during the past five years . As the young students toured the campus the mentors explained how college ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential halls and dining halls , and student athletic facilities . During the first three visits the mentors guided the young students through a writing marathon process ( Radcliffe &; Stephens , 2010 ) in which the students wrote reflections as they toured campus . Another writing activity guided by the mentors involved helping the students write digital stories about how to be successful in school and also about their future career plans . To help the young adolescents pass critical , state mandated tests in eighth grade the preservice teachers provided year-long tutoring in language arts and mathematics . Typically one mentor worked with two students throughout the semester , coaching them twice each week in half hour sessions . </p> As this cohort of students entered high school we shifted the mentoring focus to helping these students set goals and to sup porting their self-efficacy . Based on goal theory , mentoring should focus on the meaning students attach to achievement situations and the purpose to the actions taken ( Ames , 1992 ; Barker , Dowson &; Mclnerney , 2002 , Martin &; Dowson , 2009 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our study preservice teachers guided high school students in completing a goal orientation survey and discussing the meaning of goals . Within a college bound culture , reasons for engaging in a particular behavior or pursing a particular goal can become clearly defined ( Dowson &; Mclnerney , 2001 ) . Consistent with this the preservice teachers then assisted the high school students in setting short and long term goals that would support success in high school and a college-going future . </p> One of the main objectives in our study was to help the high school students develop high self efficacy . According to Bandura ( 1986,1997 ) , and Schunk and Miller ( 2002 ) , self-belief , motivation , and achievement develop when a caring , goal directed relationship emerges . The social relationship between our students and their preservice teachers became supportive and caring as they participated in weekly conversations , college information presentations , and college tours . The preservice teachers were committed to building a comfortable working relationship with their mentees , much in line with reports from Bandura ( 1986,1997 ) and Schunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and achievement develop when a caring goal directed relationship emerges during mentoring . </p> RESEARCH PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of our seven-year research is to determine if creating a college-going culture through long-term mentoring of academically and economically at-risk students , starting in their sixth grade year and continuing through high school , has a positive impact on these students ' education . Our research question is , " Will a multi-faceted set of mentor-led strategies including college visits , goal setting , tutoring , career investigations , role model presentations , writing projects , and presentations about college preparation and life have a positive effect on students ' aspirations to attend college and their success gaining acceptance by a post-secondary institution ? " These strategies support the over-arching design of this research study , illustrated in Table 1 , Mentoring Goals and Strategies in Middle School by Grade Level ( 6th-8th ) to Support Building a College-Going Culture , which presents five mentoring goals . Plans for continuation of the strategies are included in Table 2 , Mentoring Goals and Strategies in High School by Grade Level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ </p> This Year Five report describes research findings as well as factors and shifts occurring during the first five years of our seven year project that engages pre-service teachers in mentoring students , starting in students ' sixth grade year and continuing though high school , in order to create a college-going culture among the cohort of at-risk students . This report responds to several research questions about mentoring including ( a ) how have the students been supported by pre-service teachers through mentoring initiatives during grades 6-10 ; ( b ) how has this mentoring support changed over the five years ; and ( c ) what is the nature of the relationships between the men-tored students and their mentors ? Two additional research questions focus on broader topics including ; ( d ) how have the students ' perceptions and aspirations about college changed during grades 6-10 ; and ( e ) how do the treatment group and control group students compare in perceptions and aspirations about college , drop-out rates after ninth grade , and scores on state-man dated assessments in a critical college preparation subject : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design involving randomly selected participants for the treatment and control groups , a series of data collection steps over the long term of the study , and data sources that include surveys , interviews , written reflective statements , student projects , and student enrollment and academic performance measures . </p> PARTICIPANTS The participants initially included 1 69 students who attended a rural school district located 10 miles outside of a major metropolitan area . Students in the treatment and control groups entered the study in Fall 2005 , when they were in the sixth grade . The school district 's guidelines for academically and economically at-risk students , which include 13 statutory criteria such as low grades in two foundation subjects , were used to identify students for the study . With the assistance of school administrators , 100 students were randomly selected from the pool of about 120 at-risk students , 50 to serve in the treatment group and 50 to serve in a control group for our quasi-experimental research design . </p> During the first three years of the study , when the subjects were in grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject attrition resulting in a treatment group of 40 students and a control group of 40 students . A third student group , students ( n = 35 ) who were on the school 's Fall 2006 honor roll ( students who achieved all A and B grades ) , served as a second comparison group during the middle school grades . Another middle school comparison group , students who were neither at risk nor on the Fall 2006 honor roll , included 34 students who we have categorized as the routine group . During years four and five of the study , a number of the high school participants withdrew from the high school ( and district ) resulting in 33 treatment group students and 29 control group students at the end of the Fall 2009 semester . The composition of the participants in this study is 60% Hispanic , 30% Anglo , and 7% African-American . </p> The participants also include preservice teachers , typically college juniors and seniors , enrolled in two teacher preparation classes that are taught in a blended approach on the public school campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different group of about 25 to 30 preservice teachers meets twice a week from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the public school campus where the students under study are enrolled . Other participants include the school 's principal , academic dean , and the curriculum coordinator who are active planners and administrators in this project . </p> FIELD PROCEDURES This long term study is being conducted during the students ' normal school day and as part of the preservice teachers ' scheduled professional development courses that are hosted at the public school . Typically the student , or sometimes a pair of students , and a preservice teacher work together in a school classroom.The list and timetable for mentoring activities are illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 which describe mentoring goals and strategies by grade levels ( 6th-8th ) , and grade levels ( 9th-12th ) respectively . Parent permission signatures are collected for students ' participation in the project , and for each college visit . The school provides bus transportation for the students ' visit to the college which is conducted as an all-day field trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools including written self-surveys , structured written reflective reports , structured interviews , and digital stories prepared with Microsoft PowerPoint . School records were a source for students ' scores on the state mandated TAKS test ( Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills ) , and allowed tracking students ' annual registration in the school district , an indicator of attendance and drop-out trends . </p> Each year we investigated students ' perceptions about college through written surveys that included 11 Likert-type questions such as " How difficult do you think getting accepted into college is ? " The surveys allowed us to compare treatment group students ' college perceptions as they progressed through several grades in the study , and also to compare the treatment group 's responses to the survey results of the control , routine , and honor roll groups . Data was collected directly from the treatment group students about their college perceptions through an on-line survey created in www.survey-monkey.com . The survey questions included " What is the most important thing to do now in order to attend college later ? " </p> During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students created three digital stories , responding to three different prompts including " Describe an interest or positive experience at school " , " What career or job do you want during your twenties ? " , and " What must students do to be successful in middle school ? " The content of the stories provided insight into students ' career goals and perceptions of how to get there . </p> The treatment group students were interviewed by the preservice teachers to investigate their experiences with their college campus tour . An example question is " What is one thing you remember about your visit ? " We also collected the preservice teachers ' written reflections about the tours . At the end of the second year of the study we used an unstructured interview approach with the principal to explore her perceptions of the need for the study , the impacts of the research project components , and the benefits for her students . </p> During the treatment groups ' eighth grade year , when the mentoring support focused on tutoring the students in preparation for the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a critical college preparation content area : math . In response to the high school principal 's suggestion , support for the students shifted in their ninth grade year to individual mentoring , focused on defining short and long term goals . Data about the students ' goal orientation was collected from the cohort of students using the Manual for the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales ( Midgley , et a I. , 2000 ) to formulate our questions . </p> DATA ANALYSIS The hand written and online surveys included Likert-like questions , each with five response options . As an example , the question " How difficult do you think getting accepted into college is ? " included five response options ranging from " not so difficult " to " too difficult for me " . Responses were analyzed using SPSS ( Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ) statistical test software to determine mean scores and to analyze variation among groups . Higher mean scores were interpreted to suggest higher aspirations or more positive perceptions regarding college-going issues . For the state TAKS assessment , group mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in the treatment group and the control group . Chart 1 , Students ' Math Scores by Year , graphs the groups ' scores . </p> The responses to questions on structured written surveys and interviews were reviewed by the authors who looked for repetition of terms or statements . For example , a tally of responses to the question " How did the visit to the university impact the students ' perceptions about attending a university ? " netted eight responses that included " excited " , five responses stating " enjoyed it " , four responses indicating " interested " , two responses of " overwhelmed " , and so on . The authors reported their consensus on the collective meaning of such data . For example , in the above case the authors concluded that students had positive perceptions . </p> FINDINGS Our findings are organized by the following five research questions . How have the students been mentored , and how did this support our project goals ? </p> The timetable and types of mentoring support are outlined in Table 1 , Mentoring Goals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Support Building a College-Going Culture , and in Table 2 which describes subsequent support in high school . In summary the mentors hosted the students on college tours each Spring during which the students attended college classes and presentations about college admission and financial aid procedures . A significant mentoring effort during the tours was the preservice teachers ' initiative in guiding the students to reflect on their experiences of college through a writing marathon approach . The students ' responses on follow-up surveys , which indicated that they gained positive perceptions of college , support our project goals numbered one through three ( Table I ) . </p> During their eighth grade year , the students ' mentors tutored them in preparation for the state mandated TAKS test . Based on the mentor 's content strength in language arts or mathematics , the mentors individually tutored students who were weak in either language arts or mathematics . This significant mentoring initiative may have contributed to all of the students passing their TAKS tests , which also supports our project goal number four ( Table I ) . </p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped the students set short and long term goals that support success in high school and a college-going future . Once every other week for at least thirty minutes , the mentors met with their student(s) to discuss the students ' goals and progress . The principal stated that this mentoring initiative was very important to insuring that the students stayed in school . Noteworthy , fewer of the mentored students withdrew from school as compared to the control group students . This outcome is critical to supporting all of our project goals . </p> How HAS THIS MENTORING SUPPORT CHANGED OVER THE FIVE YEARS ? The nature of the college visits has changed in three ways . With each annual visit we reduced the structure for the visit in terms of a defined , detailed plan of specific places to visit and a timetable for each visit stop . Related to this we gave more power to the young students to select where they wanted to tour and how long they wanted to spend at each tour stop . Finally , we increased the tour 's emphasis on presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nature of residential life . </p> The type of support for the young students shifted during their sixth through tenth grade years as the students matured and their school setting changed . Mentoring during their sixth and seventh grade years addressed helping them explore future career interests , recognize the importance of education to their future , and discover the nature of college . Mentor support during the students ' eighth grade was shifted at the request of the middle school principal who asked that the mentors tutor the students in mathematics and language arts to help them pass the state mandated eighth grade TAKS test . </p> The mentoring support shifted again in ninth grade at the suggestion of the high school principal who requested that the mentors help support the ninth grade students ' adjustment to the rigors of high school life . Specifically the support focused on one-on-one mentoring that in ninth grade addressed helping the students find a niche in high school , and then expanded during ninth and tenth grade into setting short and long term goals that support success in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of presentations about college shifted after the students entered high school . During their middle school years college information had been presented only once a year , when the young students were on a college campus tour . Starting in ninth grade we hosted several college presentations each year at the high school . For example , during one semester preservice teachers presented on the topic of ' college student athletes ' . </p> The schedules for meetings between the students and their mentors became more flexible after the students entered high school . During their middle school years the young students met twice a week with their mentor during their first period at school . In high school the students and mentors met during several lunch meetings each semester . In addition , the students were able to meet with their mentor in one of the student 's daily classes where the mentor was scheduled to fulfill preservice teacher assignments . </p> The final shift in mentoring involved a gradual reduction in our role as researchers to structure the mentoring role . The mentoring role during middle school was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The preservice teachers ' professor closely guided their mentoring efforts , and required a product such as the young students ' digital stories . This locus of control shifted in high school to a more flexible and individualized mentoring approach where during lunch and/or in a morning class the high school student and mentor met to identify goals and discuss how to achieve them . </p> WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MENTORED STUDENTS AND THEIR MENTORS ? </p> During the students ' sixth through eighth grade years , the mentors followed a teaching role . They helped their young charges learn how to write a digital story , how to engage in a writing marathon , and how to complete language arts or mathematics homework assignments . The relationships between mentors and the middle school students were typically trusting , respectful , and individualized . The students often showed pride in working with a mentor ; sometimes the middle school students would point out to their peers : " there 's my mentor . " </p> Positive relationships continued in high school where the ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college student , their mentor . Students were accustomed to seeing mentors in their school and were comfortable talking to them . Mentors were amazed at how open and accepting their mentees appeared . Students shared their interests , accomplishments in sports , their success or lack of success in classes , and how they saw themselves in the future . The mentor-mentee relationship became causal and supportive where mentors showed interests in how the student was adjusting to high school , whether they had found supportive friends , and if they were involved in athletics or belonged to a club . </p> HOW HAVE THE STUDENTS ' COLLEGE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS CHANGED DURING GRADES 7-10 ? </p> The impact of the project on the treatment group students ' perceptions about college based on a survey administered in 7th , 8th , 9th and 10th grade about college perceptions , revealed that these students initially had positive perceptions , and that these perceptions became more positive . The difference , using paired samples , between the mean scores of the 31 students who took the survey during 7th and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p = .02 , with the 8th grade scores ( M = 43 ) exceeding the 7th grade scores ( M = 41 ) . The difference between the mean scores of the 24 students who took the same survey during the 8th and 9th grades was also statistically significant , ( 23 ) = -2.07 , p = .050 , with the 9th grade scores ( M = 44 ) exceeding the 8th grade scores ( M = 42 ) . The mean scores of the 19 students who took the survey during the 9th and 10th grades was not statistically significant , t(18) = .09 , p = .93 , with the 10th grade scores ( M = 45 ) equivalent to the 9th grade scores ( M = 45 ) . </p> The four-point gain in scores ( 10% ) over the span of four surveys has some practical significance . A mean score above 33 is interpreted as suggesting a positive perception about college . Supporting this , the preservice teachers who mentored the students consistently reported that the students were positive about the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN THEIR COLLEGE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS , THEIR MATH SCORES ON STATE-MANDATED ASSESSMENTS , AND THEIR DROP-OUT RATES AFTER 9TH GRADE ? </p> Surveys administered at the end of eighth grade revealed that the treatment group students ' perceptions about college were more positive than the perceptions of students in the control , routine , and honor roll groups . The treatment group had the highest mean score on the survey ( M = 44 ) , followed by the honor roll group ( M = 42 ) , the routine group ( M = 40 ) , and the control group ( M = 39 ) . A NOVA test results for differences in perceptions of treatment , control , routine , and honor roll groups revealed a statistically significant difference , F ( 3,133 ) = 4.1 73 , p = .007 , in mean scores for the groups . Tukey HSD post-hoc tests suggested that treatment students ' perceptions about college were more positive than the control group 's . </p> During the first two years of high school a number of students stopped attending high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher attrition than the treatment group . School and district enrollment records revealed that seven of the forty treatment group students , representing 17594 of their group withdrew from the school . They are not attending school elsewhere in the district . Eleven of the forty control group student , representing 28.5% of their group , withdrew and are not attending school in the district </p> Tracking of students math scores on the state mandated TAKS assessment at the end of 7th , 8th and 9th grade ? revealed rising scores for the treatment group and declining scores for the control group as illustrated in Chart 1 , Students ' Math Scores by Year </p> DISCUSSON OF FINDINGS RELATED TO SHIFTS IN MENTORING AND OUTCOME PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS HAVE PERFORMED A VARIETY OF MENTORINO ROLES . </p> The pre-service teachers performed five different roles , charging their roles in response to the students needs and level of maturity . Initially they as sumed the role of a teacher , helping the student in sixth and seventh grades learn how to write a digital story and how to engage in a writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide , declined in the level of authority as the students matured . Mentors fed the college tours when the student were in the sixth and seventh grades , they fecilitated the tours when the students became eighth graders , and finally they served as tour chaperones after the students entered high school . During the students ' eighth grade the pre-service teachers ' key role was to tutor the students in preparation for their state-mandated math and language arts assessments . When the students entered high school the pre-service teachers assumed a distinctly different role , to help the students set short and long term goals , and to coach them on how to find a niche in high school . Throughout the mentoring of students during their sixth-tenth grade years , the pre-service teachers regularly acted as a role model in both formal approaches , such as giving a presentation about being a college athlete , and in less formal approaches including daily discussions about how to be successful in school and the importance of college . </p> MANY FACTORS HAVE INFLUENCED THE NEED TO CHANGE MENTORING ROLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college tours changed due to three factors . As the young students matured and became more familiar with the nature of a college campus they needed less structure to guide their visit . After several tours , students gained specific interests in the college campus which led them to choose their visit stops . Finally , as the young students became more familiar with the nature of college life , they developed interests and concerns in some of the challenging aspects such as admission procedures , financial aid needs , and residential hall life-styles . In response to this , we added presentations about these topics to the college tour agenda . </p> The support for the young students shifted to tutoring during their eighth grade year because of a critical factor . These young students had to pass the state-man dated TAKS assessment modules in order to be accepted into high school . Mentoring support changed again as the students entered ninth grade because of another critical factor . These students needed support to help insure that they stayed in high school rather than dropping out . Their high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals that would sustain them in high school and that they might not find a high school niche that would help them develop a sense of belongingness and identity . In response the pre-service teachers focused their mentoring support on goal-setting with the ninth graders . </p> Starting in high school , mentoring opportunities to learn about college were expanded from the pre-service teachers leading an annual college tour to giving presentations at the high school about college life . The factor causing this change is that when students progress to high school their need to know about college admissions and financial aid becomes more acute and relevant to setting academic goals , student activity goals , and after-school employment goals . </p> In high school , the meetings between ninth graders and preservice teachers became less compulsory because unlike the middle school 's schedule which included a daily advisory period , there was no slot in the high school schedule other than a lunch period during which all ninth graders and all preservice teachers could meet . Also , unlike the middle school where attendance in the daily advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with a preservice teacher during lunch was a voluntary decision by the ninth grader . Because meetings were not compulsory in ninth grade it became important to motivate the ninth graders to meet by offering a series of pizza lunch meetings during which the students and their mentors met . In the tenth grade we were able to improve on structuring meetings by assigning the student 's mentor to a classroom that the student attended daily . </p> The mentoring role shifted from being highly structured in terms of tasks and schedules which were designed by the pre-service teachers ' professors and were product oriented , to a more individualized mentoring approach because the needs of the students were changing . In middle school , young students need an organized introduction to college because they are very uninformed about college . Our structured , guided , and product oriented approach helped introduce the middle school students to the nature of college . However , as the students gained knowledge about college and also entered high school where they began to be confronted with their individual future after graduation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beginning in high school the preservice teachers met individually with their ninth graders to discuss individual goals and how to achieve them . </p> RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MENTORS AND MENTEES CHANGED FOR SEVERAL REASONS </p> The relationship between mentors and mentees shifted over five years as the young adolescents matriculated from sixth graders to tenth graders . As twelve-year-old youngsters the mentees ' relationship with their mentors was a student to teacher relationship in which the preservice teacher presented instruction and led college campus tours . Over the course of five years this evolved to a more casual adolescent to adult-model relationship in which the preservice teacher helped their mentee set goals , shared college experiences , and chaperoned college campus tours . Of the five factors that caused this shift the most significant was the growing maturity of the mentees in terms of social , emotional , physical , and intellectual characteristics . A related factor was the closing of the age gap between mentees and mentors . The age of the mentors remained constant since each semester new mentors , typically 21- or 22-year-old preservice teachers , rotated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program at age 12 were 16 years old at the end of the fifth year of the study . Both factors , the mentees ' growing maturity and the closing of this age gap , led to less formality and authority in the mentoring relationship . Contributing to this relaxation in the relationship was the third factor , the intentional shift in the program from emphasizing instruction and tutoring by the mentors to concentrating on individualized goal-setting support from the mentors . Another factor , the shift in climate from a middle school to a high school setting , created a more grown-up setting that encouraged adult-like behavior in the mentees . Finally , after four years of experience in the building a college-going culture program , the mentees gained comfort and understanding in how to relate to their mentoring preservice teachers . </p> The findings of our research suggest that there may be positive relationships between participation in the multiple facets of our building a college-culture program and student outcomes including growth in positive perceptions and aspirations about college , perseverance in school as opposed to withdrawing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors may also influence students ' college perceptions , high school perseverance , and academic scores . For example , students ' perceptions about high school and college may be impacted by discussions with peers and family members , the influence of role models through popular media , college marketing as appearing on the internet , and high school guidance office communications . In addition students ' academic scores on state mandated tests may be impacted by the variety of instruction efforts at school including individualized instruction , summer classes , and tutoring . </p> DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS IN RESPONSE TO FIVE MENTORING GOALS GOAL #7 : STUDENTS WILL UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF COLLEGE </p> Our key strategy for helping students understand the nature of college was escorting them on a day-long campus visit each Spring which involved them in writing about their visit through a writing marathon , allowed them to help plan their visit stops , and engaged them in college information presentations . After participating in several visits it became clear that the students were learning about college based on a review of their writing marathon responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall and was so amazed . I 've never seen a stage like it . It was so much better than the one we have at our school . " In addition they were taking charge of planning the itinerary for their campus walk , asking informed questions during presentations , and demonstrating more insight about college as evident in their post-tour survey responses such as " The classes are huge which is good because there is bound to be one person that can help you . " </p> GOAL #2 : STUDENTS WILL RECOGNIZE THAT A COLLEGE EDUCATION MAY BE IMPORTANT TO THEIR FUTURE SUCCESS </p> Two key strategies for helping students recognize that a college education may be important to their future success included the digital story assignments and the motivational presentations about college , typically presented by currently enrolled college students . Reviews of the students ' digital stories about their future careers revealed that they often described plans for attending college as they shared their vision of developing a career . For example a student explained " want to attend college so I can go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question with a statement indicating commitment to college such as " When I am a college freshman " Finally , students ' aspirations toward college were very evident in their written survey responses such as " want to go here when I am older . I want to be a business owner of a major corporation . " </p> GOAL #3 : STUDENTS WILL GAIN POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS ABOUT COLLEGE </p> In written reflections about the marathons the preservice teachers consistently reported that the students were excited and positive about their visit and about the prospect of college . As previously reported in this report , students ' perceptions about college based on a survey administered in 7th , 8th , 9th and 10th grades about college perceptions revealed that their perceptions became more positive over several years . </p> GOAL #4 : STUDENTS WILL PREPARE ACADEMICALLY FOR COLLEGE ADMISSION </p> A key strategy for helping students prepare academically for college admissions was tutoring them twice per week in mathematics and/or language arts during their eighth grade year . Tutoring during this year was critical to the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessments in order to enter high school and because some high school level college-track type courses are dependent on success in middle school courses , particularly in pre-algebra . Students ' math scores increased as previously illustrated in this report and all students passed the state-mandated tests including math . </p> GOAL #5 : STUDENTS WILL SET SHORT AND LONG TERM GOALS CONSISTENT WITH A COLLEGE-GOING FUTURE . </p> A review of students ' written goals reveals that many of their goals are consistent with a college-going culture . For example one student wrote , " My chosen plan is to go to college , get a bachelors degree in political science , then go to a Texas law school in Houston to be a lawyer . " Another student wrote , " My chosen plan is to graduate high school and maybe take two years of community college and after that decide if I want to take two more at another college or try to a good job . " The mentors also reported that their students were setting goals consistent with going to college . A mentor explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goals included : " high SAT/ACT scores , and acceptance into college . " Another mentor reported that her student 's goals were to improve her GPA and maintain good status at school so that she can apply for college . </p> CONCLUSION The U.S. Department of Labor ( 2005 ) forecasts 13% growth in the national workforce between 2004 and 2014 . Many of the projected jobs will require an associate or four-year college degree . Projections of the attainment of college certificates and degrees among future workers fall short of predicted workforce needs ( National Association of Manufacturers , 2007 ) . The current study is significant because the findings from this study at year five of the seven year term suggest that the project 's many strategies to build a college-going culture through mentoring may be associated with students ' growth in positive perceptions and aspirations about college , perseverance in school as opposed to withdrawing , and improvement in state-mandated assessment scores . These factors may contribute to improving these students ' likelihood of attending college . </p> As this project continues , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and we will continue to adjust the mentoring approaches as appropriate to meet the project 's five mentoring goals and to build a college-going culture . </p> Table 1 .

The western boundary current of the subpolar gyre flows southwestward along the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula as the East Kamchatka Current and east of the Kuril Islands and Hokkaido as the Oyashio Current . It returns to the central subpolar region as an interior weak flow . The southern border of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to have migrated northward from the 1990s to the 2000s , an event suggested to have been caused by a change in the wind stress curl field ( Kuroda et al . 2015 ) . Wind-driven meridional shifts in the Oyashio Current have also been suggested by Sekine ( 1999 ) and others . # The subpolar gyre is known to have regional cyclonic circulations in its interior ( Dodimead et al . 1963 ; Ohtani 1973 ; Favorite et al . 1976 ; Nagata et al . 1992 ) . A regional cyclonic circulation , called the western subarctic gyre ( WSAG ) , is embedded in the western part of the subpolar gyre , as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . The southwestward current of the western border of the WSAG merges into the East Kamchatka Current . Due to the moderate baroclinic structures of the current and density in the WSAG , the main pycnocline ( halocline ) becomes shallower toward the center of the gyre ( Miura et al . 2002 ) , where the sea surface height ( SSH ) is observed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 # Schematic diagram of the sea surface flows ( arrows ) in the western subarctic North Pacific . Locations of stations K1 , K2 , and KNOT are indicated by stars see PDF for image # In the western subarctic region , a temperature minimum layer , called the dichothermal layer , exists at a depth between 100 m and 200 m above the main pycnocline or halocline ( Dodimead et al . 1963 ; Favorite et al . 1976 ) . The dichothermal layer is occupied by the remnant of the winter mixed layer water formed during the previous winter ( Miura et al . 2002 ; Wakita et al . 2010 , 2013 ) . In the late 1990s , hydrographic and chemical time series observations in the western subarctic region were initiated at stations K2 ( 47 ring operator N , 160 ring operator E ) and KNOT ( 44 ring operator N , 155 ring operator E ) ( Fig. 1 ) . Using observation longer than 15 years , a decadal deepening of the halocline was revealed at these sites ; in this layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere in the winter were observed ( Wakita et al . 2010 , 2013 , 2017 ) . # Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) found that the WSAG shrank northward from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s on the basis of altimetric SSH during the period of 1992-2010 . The increase in SSH in the western subarctic region due to the gyre change until 2000 was also monitored by Qiu ( 2002 ) . Combining **30;0;TOOLONG ( CTD ) and SSH data using the altimetry-based gravest empirical mode ( AGEM ) method , ( Nagano et al . 2016 ) estimated the change in the halocline or upper main pycnocline depth . As a result , the halocline at K2 was found to be displaced downward in association with the northward shrinkage of the WSAG ; further , it is related to the decadal decrease in water density in the dichothermal layer , i.e. , the base of the winter mixed layer at K2 . In other words , water density in the dichothermal layer is substantially controlled by the WSAG via the change in the upper main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting density in the subsurface layer , are included in the subarctic decadal SSH change . However , the AGEM method of Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) does not distinguish the barotropic variations from baroclinic ones , which are possibly related to the observed decadal density change . Another method that treats separately barotropic and baroclinic variations is required to examine the mechanism of the upper main pycnocline change . # Over the subpolar North Pacific , there are vigorous variations of the Aleutian Low and the westerly wind ( e.g. , Wallace and Gutzler 1981 ) , which mainly drives the subpolar gyre . Isoguchi and Kawamura ( 2006 ) reported that seasonal to interannual variations in coastal sea level and SSH in the Oyashio and East Kamchatka Current regions are generated by the wind stress changes . The decadal gyre variations in the western subarctic region might be driven by changes in wind stress induced by those of the westerly wind and the Aleutian Low . The northward shrinkage of the WSAG , indicated by the time coefficient of the first empirical orthogonal function mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to be simultaneously linked to the changes in wind stress curl in the eastern subpolar region and the region southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula , as implied by fairly high correlation in Fig. 2 . Meanwhile , note that there is no significant trend in the annual mean potential density of the sea surface water at K2 ( Wakita et al . 2017 ) . Therefore , the decadal elevation in SSH and deepening of the halocline depth at the station are not mainly attributable to changes in water density due to thermal expansion and freshwater supply in the sea surface layer . Fig. 2 # Map of correlation coefficient between wind stress curl and the time coefficient of the first empirical orthogonal function mode of SSH calculated by Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) . For the calculation , we used wind stress data provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCEP/NCAR ) . Locations of stations K1 , K2 , and KNOT are indicated by stars see PDF for image # Using a beta -plane two-layer model forced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the WSAG is expected to be driven by the change in wind stress , although this has not been fully examined by past investigators . Under the assumption of the Sverdrup balance in the interior region of the subpolar gyre , variations in the gyre volume transport and SSH excited by interannual to decadal changes in wind stress such as due to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) ( Mantua et al . 1997 ; Mantua and Hare 2002 ) were examined by Isoguchi et al . ( 1997 ) , Ishi and Hanawa ( 2005 ) , and Isoguchi and Kawamura ( 2006 ) . These simple models , in which neither the bottom topography ( e.g. , Ripa 1978 ) nor the beta-dispersion ( e.g. , Schopf et al . 1981 ) were not taken into account , reproduced reasonable decadal gyre changes . In other words , decadal fluctuations in the subpolar region are well explained by long Rossby wave responses to wind stress changes . However , these low-vertical-resolution models are insufficient to examine the observed potential density change associated with the northward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2010 , 2013 , 2017 ) and Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) . A continuously stratified model is required to discuss the wind-driven density change in the western subarctic region . # In general , Rossby wave adjustments of the oceans to changes in wind stress are involved in the wind-driven changes of the circulations ( e.g. , LeBlond and Mysak 1978 ; Gill 1982 ; Pedlosky 1987 ) . SSH changes accompanied by Rossby wave adjustments propagate westward with various speeds according to their spatial and temporal scales and are subject to eddy dissipation . Kawabe ( 2000 , 2001 ) solved the vorticity gradient equation ( e.g. , LeBlond and Mysak 1978 ) with wind stress forcing to take into account the propagations of disturbances by Rossby waves and calculated interannual sea level variations at tide gauge stations in the North Pacific subtropical region . Adopting this method to the SSH changes in the North Pacific subpolar region , we can compute the changes in SSH and water potential density due to the individual barotropic and baroclinic mode changes excited by the wind stress changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WSAG shrinkage and main pycnocline deepening are caused by changes in wind stress . # In this study , we calculated variations in SSH , volume transport , and water potential density using a dynamical model of barotropic and baroclinic Rossby waves excited by changes in wind stress including vertical and horizontal eddy dissipation . We examined whether the wind-driven SSH calculation produces the decadal SSH change associated with the northward WSAG shrinkage . Using the calculated SSH and potential density variations , we identified disturbances that yield the northward gyre shrinkage and discuss the mechanism of the decadal deepening of the main pycnocline at K2 . The data and calculation method are described in " Materials/method " section . In " Results and discussion " section , we determine the parameters required for the SSH calculation comparing between the observed and calculated SSH changes at K2 , using the obtained parameters , we calculate the SSH changes and describe their characteristics , and discuss the potential density change at K2 . A summary and conclusion are provided in " Conclusions " section . # Materials/method # SSH data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring operator from January 1993 to December 2014 in the region of 40-60 ring operator N , 140 ring operator E-130 ring operator W were collected from the Archiving , Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic ( AVISO ) delayed-time updated mapped data ( DT-MSLA-H , # http : **31;32;TOOLONG ) ( AVISO 2016 ) . We calculated the monthly mean SSH anomalies , added them to the mean dynamic topography ( MDTCNES-CLS13 ) compiled by Rio et al . ( 2011 ) , and obtained the monthly absolute SSH . To analyze interannual to decadal variations in SSH , we smoothed them using a 15-month running mean filter . The SSH data at K1 ( 51 ring operator N , 165 ring operator E ) , K2 , and KNOT were obtained from the smoothed SSH data at the nearest grids. # Wind stress data # To compute wind-derived SSH variations , we used the monthly mean momentum flux vector , tau = ( tau x , tau y ) , where tau x and tau y are the zonal and meridional wind stresses , respectively , with horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40-54 ring operator N , 160 ring operator E-135 ring operator W ( the region enclosed by a black square in Fig. 3 ) from January 1979 to December 2014 . The data were provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCEP/NCAR ) ( Kalnay et al . 1996 ) . From the tau data , we computed the Ekman pumping velocity ( w E =nablax tau /f =partial differential x ( tau y /f ) -partial differential y ( tau x /f ) , where f is the Coriolis parameter ) . Upward Ekman vertical velocity was taken to be positive w E . Namely , positive w E indicates Ekman suction . To analyze interannual to decadal variations , we smoothed the w E data using a 15-month running mean filter . Using the smoothed w E data , we calculated the SSH variations , as will be described in " Results and discussion " section . Fig. 3 # Map of the North Pacific including the bottom topography .

( 2001 ) and Fukasawa et al . ( 2004 ) and others on board the R/V Kaiyo-maru ( Japan Fisheries Agency ) were used to estimate the vertical structures of the baroclinic Rossby wave modes . The CTD sensors were calibrated before and after the cruise . Water sampling at the CTD stations was performed using Niskin bottles mounted on the CTD frame . By using the sampling data , the CTD data were calibrated . The accuracies of the temperature and salinity data used in this study are better than 0.00008 ring operator C and 0.003 ( psu ) , respectively . The zonally averaged profile of the potential density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western subarctic region between 160 ring operator E and 170 ring operator E were vertically averaged over 10 dbar to eliminate small-scale vertical variations and gridded from 10 dbar to 4000 dbar at intervals of 10 dbar . In addition , we used a climatological potential density profile around K2 based on the World Ocean Database 2013 ( WOD2013 ) ( Boyer et al . 2013 ) to examined the validity of the use of WOCE P01 data collected in such a short time for the calculation of the vertical structures of the baroclinic modes . # Model description and calculation procedure # We adopted the beta -plane linearized form of the hydrostatically balanced equations of motion and continuity to estimate the interannual to decadal variations in SSH ( eta ) due to Rossby waves forced by changes in wind stress , as applied by Kawabe ( 2000 , 2001 ) in the subtropical region of the North Pacific . Over a flat bottom ocean , perturbations of horizontal current velocity vector u = ( u , v ) , pressure p , and water density rho are solved via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omitted # where t is time and x , y , and z are the eastward , northward , and upward coordinates , respectively .

The eigenfunctions are normalized as Formula omitted # where D b is a constant bottom depth . Therefore , the vertical structure of the n th baroclinic Rossby wave mode , i.e. , phi n ( n =1 , 2 , midline horizontal ellipsis , infinity ) , is obtained as the n th eigenfunction of Eq . ( 3 ) with the boundary condition of no vertical velocity , i.e. , dphi n /dz =0 , at the sea surface and bottom , i.e. , z =0 and -D b . The barotropic Rossby wave mode is represented by the zeroth mode ( n =0 ) of Formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation of the meridional velocity perturbation due to the n th baroclinic mode of the Rossby waves , i.e. , v n , which is called the vorticity gradient equation ( e.g. , LeBlond and Mysak 1978 ) , forced by interannual to decadal variations in wind stress is obtained in Cartesian coordinates as Formula omitted # where Formula omitted , A H ( A V ) and K H ( K V ) are the horizontal ( vertical ) eddy viscosity and diffusion coefficients , respectively , and beta is the latitudinal variation of f ( i.e. , f =f 0 +beta y ) . The first , second , and third terms of the right hand side of Eq . ( 5 ) represent external forcing , eddy viscosity , and eddy dissipation , respectively .

Depending on the vertical and meridional modes , zonal scales of Rossby waves are variable in this model . kappa is the zonal wavenumber of the Rossby wave with decadal periods ( here , we adopted 10 years to examine the decadal change in SSH studied by Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) ) ; in other words , we set kappa =2pi / ( 10 year x c mn ) , although the calculated SSH is little dependent of kappa . Therefore , variations in pressure caused by impacts of the change in wind stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinctive speed of c mn as a Rossby wave , being subject to damping at the rate of r mn . Since , in this model , the geostrophic equilibrium is assumed to be instantaneously accomplished ( in reality , adjusted through the propagations of inertial gravity waves ) , an induction of wind stress forcing can excite fluctuations in pressure and velocity both to the east and west of the forcing region . # Note that Eq . ( 8 ) is the solution for a sustained forcing with the temporal step function ; therefore , we differentiate Eq . ( 8 ) with respect to t 0 to obtain the solution for an impulsive forcing , i.e. , a Green 's function of long Rossby wave .

Using the hydrostatic relation , the change in the vertical density distribution due to the n th baroclinic mode , i.e. , rho n , is expressed as rho n =-p n /g h n . # The volume transport due to the n th vertical mode through a zonal line between the longitude of the Kuril Islands ( x w ) and the longitude of K2 ( x K2 ) from the sea surface ( z =0 ) to a depth of -D is calculated as Formula omitted # where V n is the total geostrophic velocity due to the n th mode and the geostrophic relationship , partial differential x P n =rho 0 f V n , was used to obtain the right hand side . To estimate the volume transport variation caused by the wind stress change in the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the western boundary current , i.e. , P n ( x w ) =0 . Therefore , the volume transport due to the n th vertical mode is approximated as Formula omitted # The total volume transport ( Q ) is calculated by summing Q n from n =1 to infinity ( Formula omitted ) . Integrating phi from the sea surface to the bottom ( z =-D b ) , the volume transport due to the baroclinic Rossby wave modes vanishes , i.e. , Q =Q 0 . Note that the volume transport should not be identical to the East Kamchatka Current transport because we neglect the pressure variation at the western boundary . If we neglect the time-varying , eddy viscosity , and eddy dissipation terms of Eq . ( 5 ) , the familiar formula of the Sverdrup balance is obtained . Due to the rapid barotropic ( n =0 ) response to the change in wind stress , the variation in the volume transport calculated by this model , i.e. , Q , should be nearly identical to those based on the Sverdrup balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Ishi and Hanawa ( 2005 ) , and Isoguchi and Kawamura ( 2006 ) . # To examine the characteristic curves of the barotropic Rossby wave in the study region , we calculated geostrophic contours , i.e. , f /H , where H is water depth ( not shown ) . Except near the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain , the Aleutian Arc , and the western and eastern boundaries of the ocean , the geostrophic contours around the latitudes of K2 and KNOT are largely parallel to the latitudinal lines . It should be noted that the zonal scale of the meridional deviation of the geostrophic contours is much smaller than those of barotropic disturbances ( &gt;70000 km ) . Accordingly , the barotropic disturbances around the latitudes of K2 and KNOT excited by the wind stress changes in the interior region are considered to propagate zonally , being not significantly affected by the seamount chain . # Results and discussion # Calculation of the wind-driven SSH variation # Using the WOCE P01 CTD data collected in 1999 in the region between 160 ring operator E and 170 ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigma theta =rho -1000 ( kg m-3 ) , down to a depth of 4000 dbar , D b =4000 dbar ( Fig. 4a ) . The potential density steeply increases with depth particularly in the top 200 dbar , where the halocline exists and compensates for the temperature inversion in the dichothermal layer ( Nagano et al . 2016 ) . These near sea surface characteristics are typical of the early summer density profile in the western subarctic North Pacific . The main pycnocline is present from just below the halocline to a depth of approximately 1500 dbar . In this paper , we discretized Eq . ( 3 ) in terms of z at intervals of 10 dbar and obtained C n and phi n by solving the eigenvalue problem .

The vertical thin solid line indicates zero see PDF for image # The eigenfunctions of the lowest four baroclinic Rossby wave modes , i.e. , phi n ( n =1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , are shown in Fig. 4b , concurrent with the vertical structure of the barotropic mode ( n =0 ) . The obtained phi n is found to cross zero n times , i.e. , it has n nodes . Although the potential density above the depth of the winter mixed layer ( 110 m ) varies seasonally , the structure of the n th mode with n nodes under the depth of the winter mixed layer is likely to be almost independent of the CTD observation season . # The calculated phase speeds of the barotropic and baroclinic Rossby waves , c mn , are listed in Table 1 ; for the calculation of SSH at K2 , we set f 0 =1.066x10-4 s-1 and beta = 1.562x10-11 m-1 s-1 at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barotropic ( n =0 ) Rossby waves change depending on the meridional modes from 357.85 cm s -1 ( m =1 ) to 23.85 cm s-1 ( m =4 ) , and the waves can propagate across the northern North Pacific basin in shorter than approximately 8 months . Discrepancies of phase speeds at KNOT and K1 due to the beta -plane approximation fixed at K2 are estimated to be less than 6 % , so that the error of travel time of disturbances across the ocean is shorter than the temporal intervals of the tau data , i.e. , 1 month . Baroclinic disturbances are transmitted primarily by the first ( n =1 ) baroclinic Rossby waves with a phase speed of 0.4-0.5 cm s-1 but only slightly by the higher baroclinic mode waves because of their slow phase speeds ( n =2 , 3 , and 4 ) and damping due to eddy dissipation . Despite that discrepancies of phase speeds at KNOT and K1 due to the beta -plane approximation are approximately 17 % , spatiotemporal characteristics of calculated SSH variations are not significantly distorted because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cm s-1 ) of the Rossby waves , i.e. , c mn , with respect to the barotropic/baroclinic vertical ( n ) and meridional ( m ) modes # Meridional modes # Vertical modes # n =0 # n =1 # n =2 # n =3 # n =4 # m =1 # 357.85 # 0.45 # 0.12 # 0.06 # 0.03 # m =2 # 94.16 # 0.45 # 0.12 # 0.06 # 0.03 # m =3 # 42.26 # 0.44 # 0.12 # 0.06 # 0.03 # m =4 # 23.85 # 0.44 # 0.12 # 0.06 # 0.03 # Note that , using the WOD2013 potential density profile around K2 , we obtained the vertical structures of the baroclinic modes and the propagation speeds of Rossby waves . These are basically equivalent to those derived from the WOCE P01 CTD data . However , possibly because the WOD2013 climatology in the western subarctic region was constructed from a small number of data collected in layers deeper than 2000 dbar , the WOD2013 data provide artificial discontinuities in phi around a depth of approximately 2000 dbar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we adopted the vertical structures and propagation speeds of the baroclinic modes calculated from the WOCE P01 CTD data . # Next , the Ekman vertical velocity , w E , was calculated from the NCEP/NCAR monthly mean momentum flux data . Because w E has a peak around the latitude of K2 , we decomposed w E into the first to fourth meridional modes , as in Eq . ( 6 ) ( m =1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , setting L =14 ring operator latitude ( equivalent to 1556 km ) . The mean zonal distributions of the amplitude of the meridional modes , i.e. , W m , are shown in Fig. 5a . The amplitude of the first meridional mode of w E ( m =1 , solid black line ) is significantly larger than those of the other modes west of approximately 160 ring operator W owing to the strong westerly wind from the Eurasian continent and gradually decreases eastward . The second meridional mode ( m =2 , red line ) has substantial amplitudes west of approximately 165 ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green line ) and fourth ( m =4 , blue line ) modes have nearly equivalent amplitudes to the residual error ( dashed line ) defined as the root-mean-squared difference between the raw and four mode-based synthetic values of w E . Fig. 5 # Longitudinal distributions of a the mean value and b the standard deviation of W m ( 10-6 m s-1 ) in Eq . ( 6 ) . Values of the first ( m =1 ) , second ( m =2 ) , third ( m =3 ) , and fourth ( m =4 ) modes are shown by black , red , green , and blue lines , respectively . In panel a , the mean residual error ( 10-6 m s-1 ) of the Ekman pumping velocity , w E , for the four meridional modes is indicated by a dashed line see PDF for image # As shown by the standard deviation of W in Fig. 5b , the variations in the amplitudes of the meridional modes are mostly greater with the larger meridional scales expressed by the lower modes . In particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first meridional mode ( m =1 , black line ) variation exceeding 0.4x10-6 m s-1 is present between approximately 150 ring operator W and 160 ring operator W , where the westerly wind on the southern limb of the Aleutian Low prevails and wind stress curl is correlated to the SSH variation associated with the WSAG change ( Fig. 2 ) . The second meridional mode ( m =2 , red line ) has a peak variation near a longitude of approximately 167 ring operator E , the magnitude of which is greater than that of the first meridional mode ( black line ) . This peak variation of the second mode coincides with the variation in wind stress curl in the region southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula correlated to the WSAG change ( Fig. 2 ) . The variations in the third ( m =3 , green line ) and fourth ( m =4 , blue line ) meridional modes are significantly smaller than those in the lower modes . Because the meridional scales of higher modes are similar to or smaller than the resolution of the NCEP/NCAR wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest four meridional modes to calculate the variations in SSH and potential density . # Equation ( 9 ) shows that the variation in total pressure can be calculated by the accumulation of linear Rossby wave responses to the changes in wind stress curl from past to time t and from the eastern end to location x . It should be noted that because we represented a single fluctuation of w E by the Heaviside step function of time in Eq . ( 6 ) , the amplitudes of the variations in pressure and SSH are proportional to the derivative of W with respect to time , i.e. , Formula omitted in Eq . ( 9 ) ( because the derivative of the step function is the delta function ) . Therefore , to calculate the amplitude of the Rossby waves excited by the wind stress curl changes , we computed the differences in W between successive months for every longitudinal grid . # To determine the parameters related to damping due to vertical and horizontal eddy diffusion , we calculated variations in SSH , by using Eq . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eddy diffusion coefficient ) to 0 m2 s-1 , 1 m2 s-1 , 10 m2 s-1 , 50 m2 s-1 , and 100 m2 s-1 ; and B ( the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient ) to 0 m2 s-3 , 1x10-8 m2 s-3 , 5x10-8 m2 s-3 , 1x10-7 m2 s-3 , and 2x10-7 m2 s-3 . Note that , at K2 , the SSH variation is considered to be driven purely by the wind stress change to the east without being affected by topographic blocking and other gyre variations , in comparison with those at other sites such as K1 and KNOT . Accordingly , we determined the parameters based on the SSH variation at K2 . Correlation coefficients between the observed and calculated SSH are listed in Table 2 ; to focus on decadal variations , we smoothed calculated SSH time series by using a 35-month running mean filter . The highest correlation is found to be 0.79 for the case of D H =10 m2 s-1 and B =1x10-7 m2 s-3 , which is higher than the 90% confidence interval ( 0.73 ) for 4 equivalent degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated SSH variations are not sensitive to the diffusion parameters within ranges of 0&lt;D H &lt;100 m2 s-1 and 5x10-8 &lt;B &lt;2x10-7 m2 s-3 ( Table 2 ) . As described below , reasonable decadal increases in SSH were computed at other sites in the western subarctic region . Therefore , we analyzed the SSH variations based on the values of D H ( =10 m2 s-1 ) and B ( =1x10-7 m2 s-3 ) that provide the highest correlation . The value of D H for the subpolar region is two orders of magnitude smaller than that for the subtropical region evaluated by Kawabe ( 2000 ) . This is consistent with the fact that spatial eddy mixing scales in the subpolar region are smaller than those in the subtropical region ( Stammer 1998 ) . Meanwhile , the values of B for both regions are similar . # Dependence of the correlation coefficients between the observed and simulated SSH at station K2 on the eddy dissipation coefficients B ( m2 s-3 ) and D H ( m2 s-1 ) # D H # B # 0 # 1x10-8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # 0.358 # 0.758 # 0.785 # 0.781 # 1 # 0.423 # 0.366 # 0.759 # 0.786 # 0.781 # 10 # 0.333 # 0.421 # 0.763 # 0.788 # 0.784 # 50 # 0.267 # 0.498 # 0.744 # 0.767 # 0.763 # 100 # 0.337 # 0.507 # 0.712 # 0.735 # 0.731 # Time series smoothed by a 35-month running mean filter were used for the calculations # The calculated wind-derived SSH variation at K2 smoothed by a 35-month running mean filter is shown by the red thick line in Fig. 7a ; for comparison , we display the altimetric SSH variation ( blue thick line ) . The standard deviation of the calculated SSH variation during the period of the altimetric SSH observation is 4.0 cm , which is comparable to but larger than the standard deviation of the observed SSH variation ( 3.8 cm ) . It should be noted that the year of the background potential density observation at the WOCE P01 line , i.e. , 1999 , nearly corresponds to the midpoint of the decadal increase in SSH at K2 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1999 is reasonable for the SSH calculation during the study period . # The effects of eddy dissipation on the damping rates are strongly dependent on the baroclinic modes but are mostly independent of the meridional modes ( Kawabe 2000 ) . Because the amplitude of the SSH disturbances due to the barotropic Rossby waves ( n =0 ) is not significantly affected by the dissipation , the damping rates , defined as exp ( -r x 1 year ) in this paper , are nearly unity ( Table 3 ) . Due to the eddy dissipation , the amplitude of the first baroclinic Rossby waves ( n =1 ) attenuates to approximately 40% after 1 year of propagation following excitation . For the higher baroclinic Rossby modes , i.e. , the second ( n =2 ) , third ( n =3 ) , and fourth ( n =4 ) modes , variations in SSH nearly vanish within 1 year . Because the propagation speeds of these higher baroclinic Rossby wave modes are slow as described above ( Table 1 ) , their contributions are localized around the forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , i.e. , exp ( -r mn x1 year ) , with respect to the vertical and meridional modes for the case of B =1x10-7 m2 s-3 and D H =10 m2 s-1 # Meridional modes # Vertical modes # n =0 # n =1 # n =2 # n =3 # n =4 # m =1 # 0.999 # 0.377 # 0.028 # 0.000 # 0.000 # m =2 # 0.995 # 0.376 # 0.028 # 0.000 # 0.000 # m =3 # 0.988 # 0.373 # 0.028 # 0.000 # 0.000 # m =4 # 0.980 # 0.370 # 0.028 # 0.000 # 0.000 # We performed comparisons between the calculated and altimetric SSH variations at other sites . The variation in SSH at K1 ( marked by the northernmost star in Fig. 3 ) was calculated using the w E along the zonal line from 135 ring operator W to K1 and its correlation coefficient ( 0.43 ) is much lower than the 90% confidence interval . As described below , the SSH variation at K1 appears to be excited west of the southern end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly , we calculated the SSH variation at K1 forced by the w E in the region west of 180 ring operator alone . As a result , the correlation coefficient rose to 0.58 . Therefore , the SSH variation at K1 is thought not to be affected by changes in the wind stress originated east of the Aleutian Arc but to be forced primarily by the local change in wind stress to the west . However , note that the standard deviation of the calculated SSH ( 3.0 cm ) is much smaller than that of the observed SSH ( 5.2 cm ) . It is likely that the interannual to decadal SSH variation at K1 is significantly affected by changes in forcings other than wind stress . # Because station KNOT is located to the west of 160 ring operator E ( Fig. 3 ) , i.e. , outside the calculation region , we can not compute the SSH variation at this site . Instead , we obtained the SSH variation at a site east of KNOT , i.e. , 44 ring operator N 160 ring operator E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this location . Even though the correlation coefficient between the calculated and observed variations in SSH is 0.51 , which is lower than the 90% confidence interval , due to the influences of the subtropical water from the south ( Tsurushima et al . 2002 ) , the calculated SSH increases , consistent with the increase in observed SSH that we focus on in this paper . The decadal increase in SSH east of KNOT may be due to the change in wind stress in the subpolar region , as will be discussed below . # SSH disturbances can also propagate from the far east , outside the calculation region . Disturbances generated in the equatorial region due to El Nio propagate along the equator and the North American coast as equatorial and coastal Kelvin waves , and proceed westward as baroclinic Rossby waves ( e.g. , Endfield and Allen 1980 and Jacobs et al . 1994 ) . Perhaps , other types of disturbances on interannual to decadal timescales are also excited by various kinds of forcing . Disturbances excited in the narrow region near the North American coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale of the internal Rossby radius of deformation . Therefore , such disturbances decay just west of the coast due to the significant damping ( Qiu et al . 1997 ) and do not affect the SSH variation in the western subarctic region . # As described below , this simple wind-driven Rossby wave model should be noted to exhibit some discrepancies between the simulated and observed SSH variations . The discrepancies are supposed to be attributable principally to two reasons . First , topographic effects such as the joint effect of baroclinicity and bottom relief ( JEBAR ) , through which the ocean slowly respond to rapid forcing changes , were not taken into account in the model . As speculated by Frankignoul et al . ( 1997 ) , the ocean can slowly respond in the barotropic manner to shorter timescale wind stress changes and produce variations on longer timescales . In the present model , the atmospheric variations caused by El Nio excite substantial depressions in SSH , but they were not observed prominently by the satellite altimetry . Accordingly , the El Nio-related SSH depressions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed to be uniform in the whole subpolar region . Characteristics of propagations of SSH fluctuations appear to be different with respect to longitudes . In Fig. 6 , we show the spatial distribution of correlation coefficient between altimetric and simulated decadal SSH variations in the subpolar region . Significantly high-correlation ( &gt;0.73 ) areas are present in the northwestern and eastern parts of the calculation region . It should be , however , noted that a low-correlation ( reaching minimum values of approximately - 0.2 ) area extends southwestward from 50 ring operator N , 160 ring operator W to 40 ring operator N , 165 ring operator E bounded by the western and eastern high-correlation areas . This distribution of the low correlation is different from those of major bottom topographies such as the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain ( Fig. 3 ) but is likely to be a propagating baroclinic Rossby wave pattern . As in the present model , we set the damping parameters to obtain reasonable SSH variation in the WSAG region , disturbances propagating as baroclinic Rossby waves from the eastern to central subpolar North Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 6 # Map of correlation coefficient between altimetric and simulated SSH variations in the region of 40-50 ring operator N , 160 ring operator E-135 ring operator W. Contour interval is 0.2 . The 90% confidence interval ( 0.73 ) is illustrated by green contours . Variations in SSH smoothed by a 35-month running mean filter were used to calculate correlation coefficients . Locations of stations K1 , K2 , and KNOT are indicated by stars see PDF for image # Fig. 7 # Wind-driven variations in a SSH ( cm ) at station K2 ( red line ) and b absolute geostrophic volume transport ( Sv ) down to a depth of 4000 dbar to the east of K2 ( black line ) . Time series smoothed by 15- and 35-month running mean filters are indicated by thin and thick lines , respectively . Positive values in panel b indicate northward transport . For comparison , the observed SSH at K2 and the North Pacific Index ( NPI ) are shown by blue and green lines , respectively , in panel a . The NPI was smoothed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviation see PDF for image # Nevertheless , fluctuations in SSH excited in the eastern high-correlation area rapidly propagate westward as barotropic Rossby waves through the low-correlation area in Fig. 6 and contribute to the simulated SSH variations in the high-correlation western subarctic region , so that the wind-driven SSH variation component in the target region , i.e. , the western subpolar North Pacific , is considered to be appropriately computed . # Wind-driven SSH and volume transport changes # Along with the decadal increase in altimetric SSH at K2 ( blue thick line in Fig. 7a ) , the wind-driven SSH at that site ( red thick line ) increased during the altimetry observation period . The increase in SSH is found to have begun in the late 1990s , being consistent with the result of Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) . To obtain the linear trend excluding sharp interannual variations , we examined the statistical significance by the Mann-Kendall trend test ( e.g. , Wilks 2019 ) . Based on the Mann-Kendall trend test , Kendall 's tau coefficient of the calculated wind-driven SSH change during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This value is higher than the 99% confidence level ( 0.11 ) ; in other words , this increasing trend is statistically significant . Accordingly , the SSH change can be approximated by a linear trend . Using Sen 's method ( Sen 1968 ) , the linear trend was computed to be 0.54 cm year-1 , which is the same order of magnitude as the 0.66 cm year-1 of the altimetry SSH trend during the same period . # At K1 and the site east of KNOT , the wind-driven increases in SSH were calculated to be 0.13 and 0.49 cm year-1 , respectively ( red lines in Fig. 8a and c ) . According to the above Kendall 's criterion , these trends are also statistically significant . In particular , the wind-driven SSH elevation at the site east of KNOT is larger than the observed trend ( 0.38 cm year-1 ) ( Fig. 8c ) . The magnitudes of the wind-driven SSH increases at K2 and the site east of KNOT are sufficiently large to explain the observed northward shrinkage of the WSAG . Therefore , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the change in wind stress . Meanwhile , at K1 , the calculated trend is much smaller than the observed value ( 0.67 cm year -1 ) ( Fig. 8a ) , the northern part of the circulation being strongly affected by other factors than wind stress . On the basis of the decadal wind-driven SSH changes , the onset of the SSH increase occurred in order from the south , as in 1992 , 1997 , and 2004 at KNOT , K2 , and K1 , respectively ( arrows in Fig. 8 ) . Fig. 8 # Wind-driven ( red lines ) and altimetry-based ( blue lines ) variations in SSH at stations a K1 , b K2 , and c east of KNOT . Smoothed time series by 15- and 35-month running mean filters are denoted by thin and thick lines , respectively . Arrows show estimated times at the latitudes when SSH began to increase due to the WSAG shrinkage see PDF for image # The intensification of the Aleutian Low via the atmospheric teleconnection by El Nio is illustrated by the depressions in the area-weighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator N , 160 ring operator E-140 ring operator W , called the North Pacific Index ( NPI ) ( Trenberth and Hurrel 1994 ) . In association with the intensification of the Aleutian Low in winter , interannual ( 3-year ) timescale depressions were produced in calculated SSH at K2 ( red thin lines in Figs. 7a and 8b ) and the site east of KNOT ( red thin line in Fig. 8c ) . However , no clear corresponding depressions were observed in altimetric SSH at K2 and KNOT . In Fig. 9 , we display Hovmller diagrams of the altimetric SSH variations at the latitudes of K1 , K2 , and KNOT . In altimetric SSH , negative SSH disturbances were generated in 1995 , 1998 , 2003 , and 2010 at K2 and KNOT ( arrows in Fig. 9b and c ) when the Aleutian Low was intensified by El Nio and induced positive fluctuations in wind stress , w E , in regions to the east of approximately 180 ring operator ( arrows in Fig. 10b and c ) . Similar negative SSH disturbances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows in Fig. 9a ) except in 1995 and the corresponding w E fluctuations occurred to the east of approximately 160 ring operator W ( arrows in Fig. 10a ) . By the satellite altimetry , the El Nio-related negative SSH disturbances at the latitudes of KNOT and K2 reached the sites in 2003 and 2010 , respectively , but other negative SSH disturbances appear to be canceled out around or to the east of the sites by regional positive disturbances to the west of 170 ring operator W ( K1 and K2 ) or 180 ring operator ( KNOT ) . Fig. 9 # Hovmller ( longitude-time ) diagrams of the altimetric SSH anomalies ( cm ) at the latitudes of stations a K1 ( 51 ring operator N ) , b K2 ( 47 ring operator N ) , and c KNOT ( 44 ring operator N ) .

Vertical dashed lines and connecting arrows denote westernmost longitudes of significantly negative w E and their westward migrations in the 1990s , respectively see PDF for image # Meanwhile , the disturbances in SSH excited by the El Nio-related enhancement of the Ekman suction , i.e. , the increases in w E , at the latitudes of K2 ( Fig. 11b ) and KNOT ( Fig. 11c ) are calculated to reach the western end of the calculation region ( arrows ) and they are shown by the significant SSH depressions in Fig. 8b and c . At the latitude of K1 ( Fig. 11a ) , the El Nio-related SSH dips were generated to the east of 180 ring operator and sometimes to the west . Also , in the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , La Nia , elevations in SSH are excited at the latitudes of K2 and KNOT by the relaxations of the Ekman suction . The spatiotemporal patterns of the total wind-driven SSH variations at the latitudes ( Fig. 11 ) are fairly similar to and dominated by those of the barotropic SSH variations ( Fig. 12 ) . Remarkably , the ENSO-timescale variations are nearly simultaneously exited by the barotropic ( n =0 ) Rossby wave response to the changes in wind stress to the east of approximately 180 ring operator longitude , which is a region of significant wind variation due to the change in the Aleutian Low ( black line in Fig. 5b ) . The amplitudes of the wind-driven SSH variations diminish toward the farther east .

Arrows show El Nio-related SSH depressions see PDF for image # Probably because topographic effects such as the JEBAR were neglected , the modeled ocean produced significant SSH depressions , which were not comparably observed by the altimetry , in response to short-term El Nio-related intensification of the Aleutian Low . Meanwhile , in the case of La Nia , discrepancies between the simulated and observed SSH changes are not remarkable . The wind variations in the subpolar region through the atmospheric teleconnections from the tropical region consist of fluctuations on timescales shorter than approximately 10 days ( e.g. , Feldstein 2000 ) . In addition , El Nio decays more rapidly than La Nia ( e.g. , Ohba and Ueda 2009 and Hu et al . 2017 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wind stress forcing is not caused by individual pulses of the atmospheric anomalies but their accumulative modulation ; more ( less ) frequent tropical convective activity triggers extratropical wind anomalies in the central to eastern North Pacific more ( less ) often during El Nio ( La Nia ) years . These differences might be the reason why the ocean response to El Nio is different from that to La Nia. # From the mid-1990s to the late 1990s , substantially negative w E exceeding 0.5x10-6 m s-1 was mostly induced to the east of approximately 140 ring operator W and 180 ring operator at the latitudes of K2 and KNOT , respectively ; note that , in Fig. 10 , the signs of w E were reversed to match the coloring of SSH as in Figs. 9 and 11 . In the late 1990s , the negative w E abruptly migrated to 180 ring operator longitude at the latitude of K2 ( Fig. 10b ) and to 170 ring operator E at the latitude of KNOT ( Fig. 10c ) , as illustrated by vertical dashed lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greatly negative w E frequently occurred from these longitudes to approximately 140 ring operator W. The frequent relaxation of the Ekman suction is attributed to the attenuation of the Aleutian Low due to the increase in occurrences of substantial La Nia from the late 1990s to mid-2000. # Associated with this westward jump of the forcing relaxation in the late 1990s , positive SSH anomalies seem to have propagated westward from approximately 150 ring operator W at the latitudes of K2 and KNOT . Additionally , at the latitude of K1 , a westward jump of the wind forcing relaxation was observed in the mid-1990s ( Fig. 10a ) . Although the amplitude of the forcing change at the latitude of K1 is smaller than those at the latitudes of K2 and KNOT , the corresponding SSH elevation at K1 was as great as those at the other latitudes . The propagation speed from 150 ring operator W to 180 ring operator is estimated to be approximately 1.3 cm s-1 , which is much slower and faster than the estimated propagation speeds of the barotropic and baroclinic Rossby waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 ) ( Table 1 ) . The background flow in this region is up to eastward 15 cm s-1 ( e.g. , Roden 2000 ) , which is opposite to the propagation of Rossby waves . The northward shoaling of the main pycnocline is quite little ( e.g. , Roden 2000 ) . Despite taking into account of the background state , the propagation of this disturbance observed by the altimetry can not be interpreted as the free baroclinic Rossby waves alone . Presumably , this propagating signal is a result of superposition of SSH fluctuations due to barotropic and baroclinic Rossby waves forced by the westward jump of the Ekman suction relaxation , although , in the model , the disturbance is rapidly damped just east of 160 ring operator W due to the strong dissipation and is rather depressed by the 1997/1998 El Nio. # The frequent relaxation of the Ekman suction after the late 1990s caused the long-term elevation in SSH at the latitudes of K2 ( Figs. 11b and 12b ) and KNOT ( Figs. 11c and 12c ) . In particular , the attenuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Nia greatly contribute to the decadal SSH elevation , i.e. , substantial northward shrinkage of the WSAG , in the mid to late 2000s . In addition , there is a long-term decrease in w E at the latitudes of K2 and KNOT to the west of 180 ring operator longitude due to the weakening of the westerly wind ( Fig. 9b , c ) , which contributes to the increase in SSH at K2 and KNOT . # Using Eq . ( 12 ) , we estimated the geostrophic volume transport relative to a depth of 1000 dbar in the western boundary region of the WSAG between the Kuril Islands and K2 , as Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) calculated . The standard deviation of the volume transport is approximately 0.1 Sv ( where 1 Sv =10 6 m3 s-1 ) . On the basis of AGEM-based hydrographic data , Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) calculated the geostrophic volume transport in the top 1000 dbar layer at a westward line from the point of the maximal amplitude of the SSH variation ( 53 ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E ) . Associated with the northward shrinkage of the WSAG , the AGEM-based volume transport of the gyre changed from approximately southward 1.0 Sv in 1996 to northward 0.5 Sv in 2003 ( see thick dashed line Fig. 9 in Nagano et al . 2016 ) . The variabilities in the AGEM-based and wind-driven volume transports are comparable to each other but are one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the Sverdrup transport of 5 Sv ( July ) to 40 Sv ( February ) by Favorite et al . ( 1976 ) and the climatological wintertime Sverdrup transport of 40 Sv by Ishi and Hanawa ( 2005 ) . The wind-driven volume transport in the layer from the sea surface to 4000 dbar , i.e. , full-depth wind-driven volume transport , varied with a large standard deviation of 15.4 Sv . The small variability in the AGEM-based transport is attributed to the small vertical displacement of the main pycnocline . Therefore , the baroclinic variability might be really the minor component in the decadal wind-driven SSH and volume transport variations in the western subarctic region , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume transport of the extended WSAG ( Fig. 7b ) was approximately southward 20 Sv in 1994 , when Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) examined the streamfunction from the sea surface to a depth of 1000 dbar , and it was larger in the period prior to the early 1990s . The volume transport in the extended gyre state is consistent with the estimated values of the Sverdrup transport ( 5-40 Sv ) in past studies . After the early 2000s , the East Kamchatka Current returned northeastward to the north of K2 due to the northward shrinkage of the WSAG ; therefore , the volume transport vanished in the early 2000s and was occasionally positive , i.e. , northward . This is consistent with the distribution of the streamfunction of the diminished WSAG in 2004 prepared by Nagano et al . ( 2016 ) . # At the latitude of K1 , near the west coast of North America ( 140 ring operator W ) , a substantial Ekman pumping ( downward velocity ) is present through the study period but is quite limited , yielding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barotropic disturbances are generated by the wind stress changes in the central region between approximately 140 ring operator W and 180 ring operator ( Fig. 12a ) , they are likely to be shielded by the Aleutian Arc , as described above . The disturbances locally generated in the area between K1 and longitude 180 ring operator affect SSH at K1. # Figure 13 shows pentad mean wind-driven SSH maps during 1995-1999 , 2000-2004 , and 2005-2009 . During 1995-1999 , just after the onset of the gyre shrinkage ( Fig. 13a ) , the cyclonic WSAG is produced in the western subarctic region , as illustrated by a low SSH to the west of approximately 175 ring operator W. The WSAG is considerably reduced in its extension and is present only around the east of station K2 during 2000-2004 ( Fig. 13b ) , and eventually disappears around K2 during 2005-2009 ( Fig. 13c ) . The gyre shrinkage is associated with a substantial anticyclonic circulation centered around 43-44 ring operator N , 170-175 ring operator E , southeast of the WSAG ( Fig. 13b , c ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 ring operator N , 175 ring operator E during 1995-1999 ( Fig. 13a ) . Owing to the meridional scales of the WSAG and the anticyclonic circulation ( 500 km ) , the SSH change in the western subarctic region is fairly affected by the second meridional mode ( m =2 ) . Despite prominent variations with smaller spatial scales ( 100-200 km ) in altimetric SSH , the simulated wind-driven change of the WSAG is basically consistent with the gyre shrinkage observed by the satellite altimetry ( Fig. 14 ) . Fig. 13 # Maps of wind-driven SSH averaged during a 1995-1999 , b 2000-2004 , and c 2005-2009 . Contour interval is 2 cm . Stars indicate locations of stations K1 , K2 , and KNOT see PDF for image # Fig. 14 # a -c Same as Fig. 13 , but for altimetric SSH anomaly from the mean state see PDF for image # However , unlike calculated wind-driven SSH , altimetric SSH did not change significantly or decreased from 1990-1995 ( Fig. 14a ) to 2000-2004 ( Fig. 14b ) in the central area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ) . Intriguingly , the anticyclonic circulation is accompanied by a northeastward current at the western edge of the circulation ( Fig. 13 ) . The corresponding northeastward current anomalies are found in the altimetric SSH anomaly maps ( Fig. 14 ) and are coincident with a northeastward jet from around 43 ring operator N , 160 ring operator E to 45 ring operator N , 170 ring operator E ( J2 ) reported by Isoguchi et al . ( 2006 ) . # Qiu ( 2002 ) reported that the SSH variation in the initial phase of the WSAG shrinkage is caused by the baroclinic Rossby wave adjustment to the change in wind stress . Meanwhile , the present calculation of the wind-driven SSH variation demonstrates that the barotropic Rossby wave adjustment is primarily responsible for the northward shrinkage of the gyre . We think that the difference is attributable to that of the dissipation rates used in the models . The dissipation rate used in Qiu ( 2002 ) is much smaller ( 6-year damping ) than that in the present model ( approximately 1-year damping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note that the SSH variation which Qiu ( 2002 ) used to determine the dissipation rate is dominated by the variation on the annual timescale ( Fig. 19b in Qiu 2002 ) . On the other hand , as described above , we determined the eddy dissipation coefficients by fitting the SSH variations on interannual to decadal timescales . This is likely to be the reason why the dissipation rate used in Qiu ( 2002 ) is much smaller . If we set B to a lower value , 1x10-8 m2 s-3 , without changing other parameters , we obtain a smaller rate of the increase in SSH at K2 ( 0.35 cm year-1 ) . Thus , the wind-driven decadal increase in SSH in the western subarctic region is considered to be more exactly estimated in the present model with the higher dissipation , which substantially attenuates the baroclinic disturbances in the western region . # Remember that the eigenfunction of the barotropic mode is vertically constant ( the black line in Fig. 4 b ) , so that the vertical gradient , i.e. , d phi 0 /dz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change in wind stress is not associated with the density change . Conversely , disturbances due to the baroclinic Rossby waves are expected to be associated with the density changes because dphi n /dz not equal to0 ( n =1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . In particular , the vertical gradients of the modes higher than the first are remarkable just beneath a depth of approximately 110 dbar , where the winter mixed layer does not reach ( Wakita et al . 2017 ) and the variations in the sea surface heat and freshwater fluxes are considered to be ineffective . The baroclinic Rossby wave responses and the associated potential density changes will be discussed in the next subsection. # Wind-driven potential density change # The amplitudes of the SSH variations due to the baroclinic Rossby wave responses to the changes in wind stress at the latitudes of K1 , K2 , and KNOT ( Fig. 15 ) are smaller than those of the SSH variations due to the barotropic response ( Fig. 12 ) but are larger than the error of the satellite altimetric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wind-driven baroclinic SSH variations are primarily generated not by remote wind stress changes via westward propagations of Rossby waves but by local changes in the wind stress . As demonstrated at the latitude of K2 , the baroclinic Rossby wave response to the wind stress change due to the weakening of the westerly wind to the west of 180 ring operator longitude ( Fig. 10b ) contributes to the decadal increase in SSH in the western subarctic region during the calculation period ( Fig. 15b ) . This is consistent with the high correlation near K2 between wind stress curl and the SSH change in association with the WSAG shrinkage ( Fig. 2 ) . Fig. 15 # a -c Same as Fig. 9 but for the SSH variations due to the baroclinic Rossby wave modes ( n =1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) forced by the wind stress . Arrows show El Nio-related SSH depressions . In panel a , the wind stress data in the region east of 180 ring operator were not used for the calculation of the SSH anomaly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we show the first ( n =1 ) to fourth ( n =4 ) baroclinic Rossby wave mode variations in SSH at K2 . Spatiotemporal patterns of the variations due to the second ( n =2 ) to fourth ( n =4 ) modes ( Fig. 16b , c , and d ) , which amplitudes are proportional to phi ( 0 ) 2 because of no significant propagations , are similar to each other but rather different from that of the propagating first ( n =1 ) mode variation ( Fig. 16a ) . Notably , the SSH elevations due to the second and third baroclinic Rossby wave modes are more prominent than those due to other baroclinic modes and well coincide with anomalously negative forcing in space and time ( meshes in Fig. 16b and c ) . Meanwhile , the SSH elevations by the first baroclinic Rossby wave mode are rapidly dissipated apart from negative forcing times and regions ( meshes in Fig. 16a ) , resulting in smaller amplitudes of disturbances than those by other higher baroclinic modes . There are reports on SSH variabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , an analysis of the SSH variability in the South Pacific by Maharaj et al . ( 2007 ) indicates that the higher baroclinic mode waves contribute to the variations even to the south of 40 ring operator S. Remarkably , in Maharaj et al . ( 2007 ) , we recognize areas where the amplitudes of the second baroclinic mode variations are greater than those of the first baroclinic mode variations . Their report supports our indication that , also in the western subarctic region , the disturbances due to the higher baroclinic mode waves can have greater SSH amplitudes than those due to the first baroclinic mode waves . Fig. 16 # Hovmller diagrams of SSH ( cm ) at the latitude of station K2 ( 47 ring operator N ) due to the a first ( n =1 ) , b second ( n =2 ) , c third ( n =3 ) , and d fourth ( n =4 ) baroclinic Rossby wave modes forced by the wind stress . Arrows indicate El Nio-related SSH depressions shown in Fig. 14 b . Meshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each longitude smaller than - 0.2x10-6 m s-1 . The vertical dashed lines indicate the longitude of station K2 ( 160 ring operator E ) see PDF for image # With respect to the amplification of the higher baroclinic mode variations , it is worthwhile to point out the coincidence between the w E variation and the SSH variations due to the second , third , and fourth baroclinic modes . Such persistent wind stress forcing is considered to amplify disturbances until the balance between the forcing and damping is reached . The large amplitudes of the slowly propagating ( or quasi-stationary ) disturbances of the baroclinic higher modes can be interpreted by a quasi-resonant amplification ( QRA ) . This amplification mechanism has been proposed to explain the reinforcement of quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby wave disturbances with relatively high horizontal wavenumbers of 6-8 that possibly bring about frequent extreme meteorological events in recent years ( e.g. , Petoukhov et al . 2013 ; Coumou et al . 2014 ; Kornhuber et al . 2017 ) . In case of mid- and high-latitude oceans , fluctuations having large vertical scales rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind stress changes and are subject to the substantial damping . In contrast to the fast traveling fluctuations , the QRA mechanism can be exerted on quasi-stationary fluctuations of the higher baroclinic modes because they continue to be excited as long as forced and are reinforced despite the presence of the damping . # Corresponding to the intensification of the Aleutian Low associated with El Nio ( indicated by depressions in the NPI in Fig. 7a ) , negative SSH anomalies are found in the region between 170 ring operator E and 170 ring operator W at the latitudes of K2 and KNOT in 1981 , 1983 , 1987 , 1993 , 1997 , 2003 , and 2010 ( arrows in Fig. 15b and c ) . The SSH disturbances due to the first baroclinic mode ( n =1 ) propagate westward ( Fig. 16a ) at the estimated propagation speed ( 0.45 cm s-1 , Table 2 ) , even though the amplitude of the variation is significantly smaller ( &lt;1 cm ) than those of the other modes . Most of these ENSO-timescale baroclinic disturbances decayed significantly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latitude of K1 , the baroclinic SSH depressions due to El Nio are weak ( Fig. 15a ) because this site is located to the north of the area of significant variation in Ekman vertical velocity driven by the change in the Aleutian Low . # The baroclinic Rossby wave mode variations , particularly higher baroclinic mode variations than the first , are responsible for the water density change in the subsurface layer around K2 . The vertical distribution in potential density at K2 is shown by the contours in Fig. 17 ; to suppress noisy fluctuations on timescales shorter than approximately 3 years , the time series at each pressure level was temporally smoothed using a 49-month running mean filter . Associated with the decadal elevation in SSH at K2 during the study period ( Fig. 15b ) , the upper main pycnocline , which exists within depths of 100 to 300 dbar , tended to be deepened ( Fig. 17 ) . An anomalously large elevation and depression of the upper main pycnocline were observed in the periods around 1985 and 2006 , corresponding to the inductions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west of 170 ring operator E ( Fig. 10b ) , respectively . They greatly contributed to the decadal deepening of the upper main pycnocline . The locality of the main pycnocline depth responded to the wind forcing support that the QRA mechanism plays a crucial role also in the deepening of the main pycnocline depth by the higher baroclinic modes .

( 2017 ) ( the dashed line in Fig. 19 ) , we computed the annual mean time series of the wind-driven deepening of the upper main pycnocline , defined by the isopycnal surface of 26.8sigma theta , ( the solid line ) . The wind-driven deepening of the upper main pycnocline is consistent with that of the halocline . The linear trend of the 26.8 sigma theta isopycnal surface during the period of 1999-2014 is estimated to be 1.36 m year-1 , which is equivalent to approximately 70% of the linear trend of the halocline ( 1.79 m year-1 ) estimated from in situ data by Wakita et al . ( 2017 ) . Therefore , it is concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local change in wind stress and reinforced through the QRA mechanism mainly deepened the upper main pycnocline ( halocline ) depth at K2 . # As described in " Introduction " section , sea surface water density change , which can cause steric sea level change , is not significantly detected in the western subarctic region ( Wakita et al . 2017 ) . On the other hand , the precipitation rate ( rainfall ) gradually increased in the western subarctic region during the study period ( not shown ) . We estimated the impact of the freshwater flux change on the upper-ocean circulation . Using the NCEP/NCAR evaporation rate ( E ) and precipitation rate ( P ) data , we calculated freshwater flux , E -P , as processed in Nagano et al . ( 2017 ) . The vertical velocity due to freshwater flux estimated as w F = ( E -P ) /rho 0 ( e.g. , Gill 1982 ) is downward owing to the excessive precipitation in the western subarctic region and its magnitude is approximately two orders smaller than that due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elevate SSH through the study period , the impact of the freshwater flux forcing on the SSH change is much less than that of the wind stress change . # Conclusions # Focusing on the wind stress changes in the subpolar North Pacific , we examined the interannual to decadal variations in SSH related to the northward shrinkage of the WSAG using a dynamical model of the Rossby waves forced by changes in the wind stress and damped by horizontal and vertical eddy dissipation . The Ekman vertical velocity derived from the NCEP/NCAR wind stress data during the period of 1979-2014 was decomposed into the four meridional modes of the sine functions . Assuming a flat bottom ocean , the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the four baroclinic Rossby wave modes were obtained by solving the vertical structure equation based on the potential density profile averaged between 160 ring operator E and 170 ring operator E at 47 ring operator N ( WOCE P01 line ) . The SSH variations excited by changes in wind stress propagate with different phase speeds and damping rates depending on the meridional and baroclinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and B =1x10-7 m2 s-3 for the horizontal and vertical eddy dissipation coefficients , respectively , we solved the vorticity gradient equation forced by the Ekman vertical velocity and obtained realistic SSH changes in the western subarctic region . SSH depressions related to the intensification of the Aleutian Low in winter of El Nio years , which were not comparably observed by the satellite altimetry , were produced probably because topographic effects such as the JEBAR were not taken into account in the model . With respect to the variations on decadal timescales , the correlation coefficient between the calculated and observed SSH variations is fairly high in the northwestern and eastern parts of the subpolar region ; in particular , the value at K2 ( 0.79 ) exceeds the 90% confidence interval . However , probably because the damping parameters were set to be uniform in the whole subpolar region , the simulated SSH variation missed reproducing propagations of baroclinic SSH variations observed in the central subpolar North Pacific by the altimetry . The decadal SSH changes at K2 ( 47 ring operator N , 160 ring operator E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring operator E ) associated with the northward gyre shrinkage was found to be primarily caused by the barotropic Rossby wave response to the relaxation of the Ekman suction due to the attenuation of the Aleutian Low by the frequent occurrences of La Nia after the late 1990s and the long-term weakening of the westerly wind . The northward WSAG shrinkage is found to be accompanied by the intensification of an anticyclonic circulation centered around 43-44 ring operator N , 170-175 ring operator E on the southeast of the WSAG . At the latitude of K1 ( 51 ring operator N ) , the SSH variation from the east of the southern end of the Aleutian Arc is shielded and that locally excited to the west affects the variation in SSH at K1. # The local baroclinic Rossby wave response to the weakening of the westerly wind was revealed to produce a decadal deepening of the upper main pycnocline in the western subarctic region . The disturbances of the first baroclinic Rossby wave mode propagated from the forcing regions and decayed substantially after excited . Meanwhile , the disturbances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , and fourth modes , simultaneously occur with the forcing and are significantly reinforced through the quasi-resonant amplification ( QRA ) mechanism owing to their slow propagations , i.e. , persistent characters , until the balance between the forcing and damping is achieved . # Because the higher baroclinic modes have steep vertical gradients in the modal structures of the potential density in the top 250 dbar layer , the variations of these modes primarily contribute to the deepening of the upper main pycnocline . The impact of the first baroclinic mode variation on the upper main pycnocline is negligibly small . The linear trend of the wind-driven deepening of the upper main pycnocline at K2 during the period of 1999-2014 ( 1.36 m year-1 ) reached approximately 70% of the linear trend of the in situ halocline depth ( 1.79 m year-1 ) estimated by the method of Wakita et al . ( 2017 ) . The deepening of the upper main pycnocline was primarily accounted for by the baroclinic Rossby wave response to the decadal change in wind stress . # Funding # &lt;sec&gt; # This work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( JSPS ) , Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research ( 15H02835 , 17K05660 ) . # Acknowledgements # The authors thank Dr. M.

@@4010641 Historically , the school psychologist 's work in early education has been restricted primarily to providing services to young children with special education needs . A more contemporary model calls for an expanded role with a focus on school readiness and the provision of services to all young children and their families in a prevention-oriented approach that is likely to maximize efforts to improve educational and social outcomes . Guided by best practices in school psychology , school psychologists can assist parents and early educators in taking a deliberate and intentional role in facilitating child development . By acting as a liaison between the school system and early childhood settings , school psychologists can assist schools in preparing to meet the diverse needs of their youngest students and can assist early childhood educators in better preparing children for school entry ( Carlton &; Winsler , 1999 ) . The purpose of this article is to discuss an expanded role for school psychologists in early education within the context of school readiness and organized around the domains of assessment , consultation , and intervention . In addressing each of these domains , applications of best practices in school psychology are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighted to illustrate the potential contributions of collaborative efforts of school psychology and early education . Finally , challenges to this contemporary model are discussed . <p> More than ever , children between birth and the age of 5 years are exposed to educational experiences before formal schooling in some type of structured setting ( Lombardi , 2003 ; National Institute for Early Education Research , 2003 ) . Historically , young children have participated in structured preschool experiences as a result of an identified disability ( e.g. , Part H now known as Part C of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act , which has served roughly 5% of the preschool population since 1986 ) or as part of a compensatory program ( e.g. , Head Start , which has served roughly 50% of preschool-aged children living in poverty since 1965 ) . In 1999 , however , almost 65% of all children ages 3-5 years participated in some type of center-based preschool , with 46% of 3-year-olds , 69% of 4-year-olds , and 76% of 5-year-olds enrolled in programs ( National Center for Educational Statistics , 2000 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act have ensured continued delivery of services to infants , toddlers , and preschoolers with disabilities and renewal of Head Start funding has allowed for continued programming for children at risk and living in poverty . Other federal legislation , such as No Child Left Behind and Good Start Grow Smart : The Bush Administration 's Early Childhood Initiative ( 2002 ) , has recognized the need to include all young children in service delivery and promoted strengthening the quality of early childhood education services . State initiatives have promoted universal preschool , which " refers to the goal of making available to families of all 3- and 4-year-olds a program of services that provides high quality education for children and helps to prepare them for a successful entry to kindergarten " ( Bailey , 2002 , p. 3 ) . As of fiscal year 2000 , 32 states and the District of Columbia had state-funded preschool initiatives ( Gilliam &; Ripple , 2004 ) . <p> Although increasing numbers of children are accessing educational opportunities before kindergarten , there are tremendous differences in the types and qualities of preschool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Human Development Study of Early Child Care , fewer than 20% of preschool centers offered care highly characteristic of positive caregiving ( National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network , 1996 ) . Across states providing preschool , program components such as teacher qualifications , in-service training requirements , technical assistance , and collaboration with other service providers vary ( Gilliam &; Ripple , 2004 ) , potentially affecting the quality of the services provided . Poor-quality early education has contributed to alarming numbers of children arriving at kindergarten without the academic and social skills needed for school success ( Shonkoff &; Phillips , 2000 ) . In addition , there is increasing concern that many schools may not be prepared to meet the diverse needs of the children and families they serve ( Adelman , 1996 ) , especially affecting children who enter school without the foundational skills needed for school success ( e.g. , children with special education or health care needs , linguistic and cultural differences , and those with risk factors ; Ramey , Ramey , &; Gaines Lanzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who start formal schooling without sufficient academic and social skills is discouraging . As early as kindergarten , young children who experience poor social and learning experiences at school may engage in a negative cycle in which outcomes such as continued academic difficulties , antisocial behavior , and withdrawal from the school environment become increasingly likely ( Ladd &; Coleman , 1997 ) . Further , research indicates that differences in general cognitive competencies between children from high- and low-socioeconomic status backgrounds are apparent by 3 years of age , and that this gap increases through the preschool years ( Case , Griffin , &; Kelly , 1999 ; Stipek &; Ryan , 1997 ) . Finally , research suggests that school readiness at kindergarten entry has direct and indirect effects on first-grade schooling outcomes , and the link between early performance and later achievement also has been demonstrated across longer intervals of time , with prekindergarten performance being related to academic achievement through Grade 10 ( Stevenson &; Newman , 1986 ) . <p> Recently , a transactional perspective of school readiness , consistent with a focus on prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population ( Fantuzzo , McWayne , &; Bulotksy , 2003 ; Power , 2003 ; Shapiro , 2000 ; Sheridan &; Gutkin , 2000 ) , has been advocated to address the diverse needs of children entering kindergarten ( Carlton &; Winsler , 1999 ) . This transactional model centers on the readiness of the child to enter school as well as the readiness of the school to receive the child and meet the child 's individual developmental needs , using dynamic models of assessment and working closely with parents and teachers to promote positive outcomes . The purpose of this article is to discuss an expanded role for the school psychologist in early education ( n1 ) within the context of school readiness and organized around the domains of assessment , consultation , and intervention . In addressing each of these domains , applications of best practices in school psychology are presented with modifications relevant to early childhood , and the skills and knowledge necessary to implement such practices are delineated . In addition , research is highlighted that illustrates the potential contributions of collaborative efforts between school psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> School psychologists can contribute to meaningful assessment and effective intervention in the context of school readiness by providing early educators with a scientific framework for interpreting rate of skill development relative to various criteria for growth and development . School psychologists can work with early educators to identify instructional foci and curricula that are well matched to children 's individualized needs and assist with assessment plans that are technically meaningful and family centered ( McWilliam , Maxwell , &; Sloper , 1999 ) . Whereas traditionally school psychologists ' involvement in early education has been restricted primarily to providing services to young children with special education needs , an expanded role with a focus on school readiness calls for the provision of services to all young children and their families in a prevention-oriented approach . Assessment <p> Best practices in school psychology promote assessment methods that facilitate the measurement of skill growth over time and contextual and functional approaches to skill development and behavior . Two major foci are general outcome measurement ( GOM ; Fuchs &; Deno , 1991 ; Shinn , 1989 ) and functional behavioral assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of these approaches extend assessment practices beyond traditional eligibility decision making , emphasizing a teach-test-teach model instead of a refer-test-place model ( Flanagan , Sainato , &; Genshaft , 1993 ) . Further , both GOM and FBA can be used in the context of school readiness to support children as they transition from early childhood settings to formal schooling . <p> A GOM approach to assessment is designed to determine child progress toward long-term goals by frequently monitoring skills that represent critical and valued goals of the educational or developmental process ( Fuchs &; Deno , 1991 ) . GOM generates data that can be used to monitor and evaluate the progress of individual children as well as groups of children . Many schools using GOM in K-12 settings ( e.g. , Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills ; Kaminski &; Good , 1996 ; curriculum-based measurement ; Deno , 1985 ) have sought out similar models for younger children to create a meaningful link between early education and formal schooling ( Missall , McConnell , &; Cadigan , 2006 ) . For example , early literacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Institute -- Measuring Growth and Development , 1998 , 2000 ) assess vocabulary , rhyming , and alliteration , three skills related to successful reading . Collecting GOM data on all children can facilitate the establishment of benchmarks , or set criteria , for success . School psychologists can assist early educators in using this information to inform instruction and intervention to accelerate the progress of those children who are struggling and assist them in meeting the criterion . Further , school psychologists can aid kindergarten teachers in using preschool GOM data to plan instruction to accommodate diverse learners as they enter kindergarten ( Fuchs &; Fuchs , 1998 ) . Evidence-based practice for the use of GOM and other alternative assessment models is growing ( see Bagnato , 2005 , for a detailed discussion ) . In this issue , Greenwood et al . ( 2006 ) describe the development of a GOM , or an IGDI for problem-solving in infants and toddlers . In a field-based application of GOMs , the utility and social validity of the early language and literacy IGDIs for monitoring the growth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of the measures to evaluate the effects of intervention ( Phaneuf &; Silberglitt , 2003 ) . <p> Many of the skills that school psychologists employ in implementing GOM systems in the K-12 setting generalize to early education settings with some modification . In each setting , school psychologists need to be able to evaluate curricula , articulate the goals of instruction , and identify instructional targets related to the broad outcome measured by a GOM . In early education settings , it is particularly critical that school psychologists undertake this task in relation to the goals of formal schooling to specify measurement and instructional targets linked meaningfully to skills and knowledge needed for success in kindergarten . Knowledge of early education curricula can be gained primarily through a review of instructional materials , teacher interviews , and observations . Because a formal curriculum may not be used in all early education settings , specific knowledge of early development is necessary for the identification of target skills that are predictive of performance of important or valued behaviors at a different stage of development , or a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development for infants and toddlers ( e.g. , Early Communication IGDI ) and preschoolers ( e.g. , Picture Naming IGDI ) focuses on early communication skills and expressive vocabulary , indicators related to the broader behaviors of cognition , social interaction , and reading . School psychologists must understand how target skills are represented in the curriculum , realized in everyday activities , and connected to long-term goals . <p> In addition , school psychologists must understand the conceptual foundation of GOM to effectively use the system in the context of school readiness . GOM could be used potentially for screening , identifying children in need of instructional assistance , designing interventions , and evaluating the effects of instruction and intervention , all essential components to improving outcomes for children that hold promise for use in a response to intervention system ( VanDerHeyden , 2005 ) . As school psychologists in early education typically have been limited to traditional eligibility assessment activities that have questionable instructional utility ( McConnell , 2000 ) , the challenge is to create a new role for assessment and school psychologists that is prevention oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologists to collaborate with early educators to facilitate competency in key skill areas and promote school readiness for all children . Finally , one of the current significant limitations of GOM in early education is limited accessibility ( www.getgotgo.net ; www.igdi.ku.edu ) . Related to this issue is the need for more extensive documentation of the reliability , validity , and utility of GOM in early education . School psychologists can assist with further research efforts in these areas to increase the accessibility and use of GOM . School psychologists can also assist early educators in using more readily available curriculum-referenced measures ( e.g. , Assessment , Evaluation , and Programming System ; Bricker , 2002 ) to promote formative assessment and data-based decision making . <p> Whereas GOM is a measurement technology , FBA is a scientific framework to guide assessment , decision making or data interpretation , and intervention development ; hence , GOM may be used within FBA to inform those processes . Several studies have demonstrated the utility of functional assessment for young children with behavioral difficulties ( Boyajian , DuPaul , Handler , Eckert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lentini , &; Clarke , 2004 ; VanDerHeyden , Witt , &; Gatti , 2001 ) . Boyajian et al . ( 2001 ) demonstrated the use of brief functional analyses with preschoolers at risk for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . Procedures were effective in identifying conditions under which problem behavior occurred and developing interventions to reduce the problem behavior . In a group application , VanDerHeyden et al . ( 2001 ) used descriptive assessment to identify variables maintaining disruptive behavior in two early education classrooms . Based on the assessment , intervention procedures were developed that reduced problem behavior at a classroom level . <p> FBA can be used to promote school readiness by reducing problem behavior that interferes with a child 's ability to learn and interact with others . Replacement behaviors can be strategically selected to link to the instructional and social behavior that children need for school success , such as attending skills , following directions , engaging with materials , and participating in group activities . Because these self-regulatory behaviors , or learning-related social skills , are predictive of future difficulties ( McClelland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prevention perspective these types of behaviors make ideal targets for intervention . Moreover , in survey studies kindergarten teachers have rated learning-related social skills as critical to successful adjustment in kindergarten ( Foulks &; Morrow , 1989 ) and have indicated that such behaviors are a problem for half or more of the children entering kindergarten ( Rimm-Kaufmann , Pianta , &; Cox , 2000 ) . <p> Although the conceptual structure of FBA generalizes easily across different populations , application of the procedures to early education may require some modifications . School psychologists may need to modify existing assessment methods to adequately capture environmental variables in home and early education settings as activities and routines are likely to be significantly different from those in school-based settings . For example , scatter plots used to examine the temporal relation between a child 's behavior and different contexts ( Touchette , MacDonald , &; Langer , 1985 ) may reflect caregiving routines as well as class activities ; interviews may have a similar focus ( e.g. , the Waking Day Interview ; Barnett , Bell , &; Carey , 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , the use of physical indicators showing children where to sit during large group activities ) ; and behavioral observations may focus on engagement in play or group participation as opposed to academic on-task behavior . General knowledge of child development assists in modifying procedures with a home-based focus while practical experience in early childhood settings contributes to the knowledge base necessary to modify procedures with a classroom focus . Finally , familiarity with the eco-behavioral early childhood literature ( Dunn , 1993 ; Kontos , Burchinal , Howes , Wisseh , &; Galinksy , 2002 ) and the environmental arrangements literature ( Lawry , Danko , &; Strain , 1999 ) can assist school psychologists in better understanding the complexity of early childhood settings and enable them to identify key variables in supporting children in the classroom . Consultation and Intervention <p> Working in partnership with parents and early educators , school psychologists can provide coaching and facilitate problem solving about classroom and individual child issues ( Donahue , Falk , &; Provet , 2000 ) . A number of studies have suggested the effectiveness of consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ( Boyajian et al. , 2001 ; Duda et al. , 2004 ; LePage , Kratochwill , &; Elliott , 2004 ; McGoey , DuPaul , Eckert , Volpe , &; Van Brackle , 2005 ) . For example , in their study with two preschool-age children , Duda et al . ( 2004 ) used consultation procedures to develop a positive behavior support plan based on functional assessment procedures . Interventions were implemented in the children 's natural environment and resulted in decreases in problem behavior and increases in active engagement across settings . In an investigation of consultant outcomes , treatment effects , and consumer satisfaction with preschool consultation , LePage et al . ( 2004 ) reported improved outcomes ( e.g. , decreased aggression and tantrums and increased social interaction ) in the majority of cases , with most treatment goals being met in more than 70% of cases . Further , parents and educators indicated satisfaction with the consultation process . <p> Although behavioral issues often are the central focus of consultation in early education , instructional consultation is equally important when considering issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing children with key foundational early learning skills . Emerging evidence suggests its effectiveness in accelerating the development of children at program and individual child levels . For example , an evaluation of Pittsburgh 's early childhood initiative found that progress of high-risk children was associated with participation in programs that received ongoing collaborative consultation and mentoring ( Bagnato , Suen , Brickley , Smith-Jones , &; Dettore , 2003 ) . In just one example at the individual child level , consultation procedures were used to teach parents to use responsive interaction and incidental teaching skills , which resulted in an increase in children 's verbal behavior and parental maintenance of skills ( Peterson , Carta , &; Greenwood , 2005 ) . Given increasing evidence about the importance of early experiences in promoting educational outcomes ( Hart &; Risley , 1995 ; Shonkoff &; Phillips , 2000 ) , working with caregivers to increase their active engagement in their child 's learning is an essential and pivotal role for school psychologists in promoting school readiness ( Carlton &; Winsler , 1999 ) . School psychologists can assist parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in facilitating development by strategically planning learning experiences for young children . <p> In consulting with early educators and parents , school psychologists are likely to use a range of consultation models consistent with general training in consultation , such as behavioral , organizational , instructional , and mental health models . Most models likely will use a problem-solving approach to some extent that focuses on operationalizing the problem in behavioral terms and working collaboratively with educators and parents to address the problem . In terms of process and procedures of consultation , then , for the most part school psychologists can generalize their existing skills to providing services to early education settings with some modification . For example , school psychologists could facilitate consultee-centered groups to address classroom concerns ( Babinksi &; Rogers , 1998 ) , or at the organizational level , consult within an early education setting regarding implementation of screening for social emotional difficulties . <p> Flexible interpersonal skills may be necessary to best establish productive and effective collaborations . In early education settings , school psychologists may consult with teachers with limited formal training as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of physical , occupational , speech , and language therapies , and of medical issues . School psychologists in early education settings likely develop a style of interpersonal interactions through practical experience with multidisciplinary collaborations . These practical experiences afford school psychologists a better understanding of the unique culture of each early education program , which is essential to forming effective partnerships ( Donahue et al. , 2000 ) . They also allow school psychologists to make modifications to consultation procedures to best meet the needs of a particular setting . For example , because it may be more likely that professional service is provided directly in the early education classroom , consultative sessions might be conducted during classroom playtime on the floor with children , often by directly modeling proposed strategies . <p> Perhaps one of the more significant modifications that school psychologists make in providing consultative services in early education settings is an increased emphasis on working with families . Engaging families in their child 's education at the earliest point possible is particularly critical in early childhood , given parents ' role as the primary educator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view family services in terms of parent involvement and home school partnerships . Although home-school collaboration interventions ( e.g. , daily report cards , school-to-home notes ) have been demonstrated to be effective in improving academic and social outcomes ( Cox , 2005 ) , consistent with early intervention , school psychologists in early education settings need to go beyond this perspective and advocate for a more family-centered approach that emphasizes support to families as a goal in itself , not just as a way to directly influence the child 's educational functioning . That is , support to families is not solely to improve educational outcomes for the child , but to more broadly enhance families ' functioning in their role as caregivers . As such , in a family-centered approach , school psychologists can involve families as key decision makers and consider their needs beyond their child 's education ( McWilliam et al. , 1999 ) . Because young children are affected by family issues , meeting the needs of family members can indirectly , yet significantly , enhance a child 's educational functioning . Understanding familial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families , as well as cultural influences , facilitates a collaborative family-centered approach to planning and implementing interventions . <p> In terms of the content or focus of consultation with early educators and parents , school psychologists need to expand their role in intervention development and implementation beyond the traditional psychoeducational issues of the school setting . In developing interventions , school psychologists promote instruction and intervention that blend developmentally appropriate learning perspectives and expectations with intentional and strategic adult-guided learning and scaffolding to increase the child 's capacity to function in his or her environment ( Wolery , 2000 ) . Although more research is needed to identify effective intervention and instruction in early education settings , several sources focused on young children with disabilities provide strategies that can be used regardless of disability status ( see Cavallaro &; Haney , 1999 ; Pretti-Frontczak &; Bricker , 2004 ; Sandall &; Schwartz , 2002 ) . <p> Content-related knowledge about important developmental domains , target behaviors , and interventions related to school readiness is essential , particularly language and early literacy ( Barnett et al. , 1999 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an effective means of increasing language and early literacy skills ( Crain-Thoreson &; Dale , 1999 ) . Research also indicates the need for school psychologists to give attention to interventions that promote early learning development in other important areas , such as mathematics . Starkey and Klein ( 2000 ) reported that a parent-child mathematics intervention with 59 Head Start families was effective in the development of more extensive mathematical knowledge . In addition to specific skill areas , school psychologists can assist in the implementation of strategies to facilitate active engagement and the development of learning-related social skills as these are indicators of classroom quality and predictive of later school success ( McClelland &; Morrison , 2003 ; McClelland et al. , 2000 ; Raspa , McWilliam , &; Ridley , 2001 ) . <p> To address behavior concerns , school psychologists in early education settings can be instrumental in promoting the use of a systematic approach to preventing and managing behavior problems . Although the positive behavior support systems literature typically has focused on its use with older children , the basic principles and procedures can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &; Becker , 2005 , for a more detailed discussion ) . At the primary or universal level , school psychologists can assist early educators in identifying behaviors essential for school readiness and social competence , developing a plan to teach and reinforce those behaviors in the early education setting , and creating supportive environments through environmental arrangements . For example , a classroomwide intervention involving instruction in direction following , sharing , and problem solving was demonstrated to be effective in improving the adaptive behavior , social interaction , and attention of children in Head Start classrooms ( Serna , Nielsen , Lambros , &; Forness , 2000 ) . At the secondary or targeted level , school psychologists can provide direct service , perhaps by conducting social skills training for at-risk young children , or training and supporting early educators in providing social skills instruction ( Denham &; Burton , 1996 ; Guglielmo &; Tryon , 2001 ) . At the individualized level , school psychologists can use principles of applied behavior analysis ( e.g. , differential reinforcement ) with developmentally appropriate modifications as needed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided more frequently and more immediately for younger children than for older children . Further , school psychologists may need to work closely with early educators to ensure that interventions are consistent with guiding philosophies common in early education settings . For example , timeout from a reinforcement procedure may not be permissible , or the use of tangible reinforcements may be discouraged in some settings . To promote social validity ( Wolf , 1978 ) of interventions , effective school psychologists will work to ensure that there is a connection between intervention strategies and goals of important stakeholders . Further , school psychologists may assist in achieving a balance between acceptable practice and effective practice as the two are not always synonymous , particularly in early education where perspectives about instruction and intervention may vary widely . Integral to this balance is the ability to adapt interventions to be more acceptable while maintaining effectiveness . <p> Although creating productive partnerships with families as well as educators may be important to successful implementation of all levels of positive behavior support ( Minke &; Anderson , 2005 ) , the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be extended to school psychologists ' work with families . Interventions at this level typically consist of FBA procedures and interventions documented to be effective with families with children with and without disabilities ( Lucyshyn , Dunlap , &; Albin , 2002 ) . Collaborating with families requires school psychologists to be familiar with interventions that focus on concerns beyond the classroom , such as challenging behaviors while transporting children , sleep , toileting issues , and other daily caregiving routines ( Barnett et al. , 1999 ) . In addition to addressing behavior issues in the home , school psychologists can actively promote skill generalization by helping parents understand the importance of consistency of interventions across settings and supporting parents in implementing school-based interventions in the home setting . Finally , to promote family-centered practices , it is particularly important for school psychologists to understand a family 's perspective of their own needs , values , and resources ( Bailey , 2004 ; Dunst , Trivette , &; Deal , 1988 ) as a starting point for consultation and intervention . <p> In general , school psychologists support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be individualized or provided in a group format through workshops or training opportunities . Although these activities may differ in terms of the intensity of services , both require collaborative efforts best developed through genuine and meaningful relationships ( Donahue et al. , 2000 ) and use research-based knowledge to ensure effective intervention development . For school psychologists to do this effectively , they need content-related knowledge of important domains in early development ( e.g. , early literacy , language , number sense , social competence ) and an understanding of principles of intervention in early education , specifically that interventions should be naturalistic , embedded , and activity based ( Bricker , 2002 ; Sandall , McLean , &; Smith , 2000 ) . Routinely accessing early childhood special education and early intervention research in publications such as the Journal of Early Intervention , Topics in Early Childhood Special Education , and Early Childhood Research Quarterly assists school psychologists in being informed about important developments in the field . In addition , resources such as Engaging Young Children in Mathematics ( Clements , Sarama , &; DiBiase , 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early Childhood Development ( Shonkoff &; Phillips , 2000 ) , and The Transition to Kindergarten ( Pianta &; Cox , 1999 ) can offer school psychologists important developmental information to inform intervention development . Challenges and Implications for Practice <p> Many of the skills that school psychologists need to work effectively in early education are part of the typical training in school psychology . With modifications , these skills can be used to promote positive outcomes for very young children in the context of school readiness . There are several issues , however , that must be considered if school psychologists are to collaborate effectively with early educators and take a more active role in early education . First , early education programs are diverse in terms of teacher preparation and certification requirements , organizational structures , funding sources , and program philosophy goals . These variations may have implications for the role of school psychologists in specific settings . For example , working more closely with families may be facilitated in Head Start 's model and may provide more of a challenge in settings in which family involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are required to contract with a mental health consultant , whereas publicly and privately funded preschools may not have access to such services . School psychologists ' roles and responsibilities must change according to the needs of each setting . Research with Head Start indicates that early educators and mental health consultants " need help in better observing and understanding the behaviors of children , understanding the role of trauma in their lives , and becoming more careful observers of child and family strengths and weaknesses " ( Knitzer , 2004 , p. 185 ) . Also , this research has shown that efforts to improve outcomes for young children should include the provision of " technical assistance that is more individualized , sustained , and ' hands-on ' regarding classroom incorporation of strong language and literacy programs and appropriate learning activities to maximize all children 's school readiness skills " ( Ramey &; Ramey , 2004 , p. 15 ) . It is likely that early educators in other settings would also benefit from consultative support in the same areas . Thus , despite programmatic differences , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services school psychologists provide to early education programs , namely , collaborating to support children 's social and preacademic development in the context of school readiness , consistent with the paradigm shift ( Reschly &; Ysselyke , 2002 ) and general movement of the field of school psychology ( Dawson et al. , 2004 ) . <p> In addition to differences within early education , there are potential differences between the professional perspectives of early educators and school psychologists . Extrapolating from the differences between early childhood philosophies and special education philosophies ( Mowder &; Widestrom , 1986 ) , school psychologists and early educators may differ in their perspectives on degree of teacher direction and initiative in early learning , the need for intentional , structured , and individualized learning activities , or the use of classroom behavior management systems . Moreover , many school psychologists may have an overall behavioral orientation toward problem solving , which is a theoretical perspective and approach that may not be consistent with the perspective and approach of early educators . Potential consequences of disconnect include variations in expectations of services , goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , school psychologists may take a very behavioral approach to assessment , focusing specifically on skill attainment , whereas early educators may take a more global perspective and consider children 's approach to learning or disposition . The assessment tools that each would use , then , varies , as does the expected outcomes of assessment and intervention . School psychologists need to be aware of areas of difference , identify common goals ( e.g. , prepare children for formal schooling ) , and work toward improving communication around assessment , consultation , and intervention issues . Perhaps as school psychologists begin to collaborate effectively with early educators in the context of school readiness , successful outcomes will generate a shared perspective that will in turn fuel greater collaboration . <p> Access to settings may be the most significant challenge for school psychologists wanting to extend their services to early education . Many early education programs simply may not have the resources for prevention-oriented school psychology services , and legislative mandates only require schools to provide services to children with special education needs , although this is changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's educational and mental health model may preclude the use of school psychology services for preacademic or behavioral support . Resolving this issue requires a paradigm shift across the disciplines of school psychology and early education to a collaborative prevention model in which all children have access to services to promote positive outcomes . Part of this paradigm shift is a reconceptualization about what school psychologists can contribute to early education teams that is reflective of more contemporary practices ( e.g. , dynamic assessment , consultation , and intervention development ) . <p> To that end , Carlton and Winsler ( 1999 ) advocate for a comprehensive outreach program between school systems and area preschools to promote school readiness in which school psychologists would act as a liaison between the two . Such a system would assist in making kindergarten teachers aware of the needs of incoming children and planning appropriate instruction . It also would serve as an informational resource for preschool programs , assisting them to better prepare children for formal schooling . A model of education that focuses on quality experiences before kindergarten and promotes seamless service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can benefit all children ( Karweit , 1994 ) . Such a model would include an integrated curriculum that links instructional goals from one setting and grade to another , assessment data documenting progress and response to intervention as children gain skills and transition between settings and grades , and an articulated teaching pedagogy reflective of best practices in related disciplines , such as school psychology and special education . Given the importance of early intervention and prevention and the increasing opportunities for school psychologists to contribute to efforts in this area represented by the sheer number of children in early education programs , the field of school psychology needs to explicitly and directly embrace a training and practice model that reaches beyond traditional K-12 boundaries with an emphasis on school readiness .

@@4002641 PREMATURE PEACEMAKING <p> AN UNPLEASANT truth often overlooked is that although war is a great evil , it does have a great virtue : it can resolve political conflicts and lead to peace . This can happen when all belligerents become exhausted or when one wins decisively . Either way the key is that the fighting must continue until a resolution is reached . War brings peace only after passing a culminating phase of violence . Hopes of military success must fade for accommodation to become more attractive than further combat . <p> Since the establishment of the United Nations and the enshrinement of great-power politics in its Security Council , however , wars among lesser powers have rarely been allowed to run their natural course . Instead , they have typically been interrupted early on , before they could burn themselves out and establish the preconditions for a lasting settlement . Cease-fires and armistices have frequently been imposed under the aegis of the Security Council in order to halt fighting . NATO 's intervention in the Kosovo crisis follows this pattern . <p> But a cease-fire tends to arrest war-induced exhaustion and lets belligerents reconstitute and rearm their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease-fire ends -- and it does usually end . This was true of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948-49 , which might have come to closure in a matter of weeks if two cease-fires ordained by the Security Council had not let the combatants recuperate . It has recently been true in the Balkans . Imposed cease-fires frequently interrupted the fighting between Serbs and Croats in Krajina , between the forces of the rump Yugoslav federation and the Croat army , and between the Serbs , Croats , and Muslims in Bosnia . Each time , the opponents used the pause to recruit , train , and equip additional forces for further combat , prolonging the war and widening the scope of its killing and destruction . Imposed armistices , meanwhile -- again , unless followed by negotiated peace accords -- artificially freeze conflict and perpetuate a state of war indefinitely by shielding the weaker side from the consequences of refusing to make concessions for peace . <p> The Cold War provided compelling justification for such behavior by the two superpowers , which sometimes collaborated in coercing less-powerful belligerents to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed cease-fires ultimately did increase the total quantity of warfare among the lesser powers , and armistices did perpetuate states of war , both outcomes were clearly lesser evils ( from a global point of view ) than the possibility of nuclear war . But today , neither Americans nor Russians are inclined to intervene competitively in the wars of lesser powers , so the unfortunate consequences of interrupting war persist while no greater danger is averted . It might be best for all parties to let minor wars burn themselves out . THE PROBLEMS OF PEACEKEEPERS <p> TODAY CEASE-FIRES and armistices are imposed on lesser powers by multilateral agreement -- not to avoid great-power competition but for essentially disinterested and indeed frivolous motives , such as television audiences ' revulsion at harrowing scenes of war . But this , perversely , can systematically prevent the transformation of war into peace . The Dayton accords are typical of the genre : they have condemned Bosnia to remain divided into three rival armed camps , with combat suspended momentarily but a state of hostility prolonged indefinitely . Since no side is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive to negotiate a lasting settlement ; because no path to peace is even visible , the dominant priority is to prepare for future war rather than to reconstruct devastated economies and ravaged societies . Uninterrupted war would certainly have caused further suffering and led to an unjust outcome from one perspective or another , but it would also have led to a more stable situation that would have let the postwar era truly begin . Peace takes hold only when war is truly over . <p> A variety of multilateral organizations now make it their business to intervene in other peoples ' wars . The defining characteristic of these entities is that they insert themselves in war situations while refusing to engage in combat . In the long run this only adds to the damage . If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster and more decisively , it would actually enhance the peacemaking potential of war . But the first priority of U.N . peacekeeping contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel . Unit commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not strategically purposeful , as siding with the stronger power overall would be ; rather , it merely reflects the determination of each U.N . unit to avoid confrontation . The final result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome , which requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting . <p> Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately attacked . At best , U.N . peacekeeping forces have been passive spectators to outrages and massacres , as in Bosnia and Rwanda ; at worst , they collaborate with it , as Dutch U.N . troops did in the fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of military age from the rest of the population . <p> The very presence of U.N . forces , meanwhile , inhibits the normal remedy of endangered civilians , which is to escape from the combat zone . Deluded into thinking that they will be protected , civilians in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretense of protection in an especially perverse manner : U.N . personnel inspected outgoing flights to prevent the escape of Sarajevo civilians in obedience to a cease-fire agreement negotiated with the locally dominant Bosnian Serbs-who habitually violated that deal . The more sensible , realistic response to a raging war would have been for the Muslims to either flee the city or drive the Serbs out . <p> Institutions such as the European Union , the Western European Union , and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe lack even the U.N . ' s rudimentary command structure and personnel , yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations , with predictable consequences . Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat , they satisfy the interventionist urges of member states ( or their own institutional ambitions ) by sending unarmed or lightly armed " observer " missions , which have the same problems as U.N . peacekeeping missions , only more so . <p> Military organizations such as NATO or the West African Peacekeeping Force ( ECOMOG , recently at work in Sierra Leone ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war , but they can at least protect civilians from its consequences . Even that often fails to happen , however , because multinational military commands engaged in disinterested interventions tend to avoid any risk of combat , thereby limiting their effectiveness . U.S. troops in Bosnia , for example , repeatedly failed to arrest known war criminals passing through their checkpoints lest this provoke confrontation . <p> Multinational commands , moreover , find it difficult to control the quality and conduct of member states ' troops , which can reduce the performance of all forces involved to the lowest common denominator . This was true of otherwise fine British troops in Bosnia and of the Nigerian marines in Sierra Leone . The phenomenon of troop degradation can rarely be detected by external observers , although its consequences are abundantly visible in the litter of dead , mutilated , raped , and tortured victims that attends such interventions . The true state of affairs is illuminated by the rare exception , such as the vigorous Danish tank battalion in Bosnia that replied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quickly stopping the fighting . THE FIRST " POST-HEROIC " WAR <p> ALL PRIOR examples of disinterested warfare and its crippling limitations , however , have been cast into shadow by NATO 's current intervention against Serbia for the sake of Kosovo . The alliance has relied on airpower alone to minimize the risk of NATO casualties , bombing targets in Serbia , Montenegro , and Kosovo for weeks without losing a single pilot . This seemingly miraculous immunity from Yugoslav anti-aircraft guns and missiles was achieved by multiple layers of precautions . First , for all the noise and imagery suggestive of a massive operation , very few strike sorties were actually flown during the first few weeks . That reduced the risks to pilots and aircraft but of course also limited the scope of the bombing to a mere fraction of NATO 'S potential . Second , the air campaign targeted air-defense systems first and foremost , minimizing present and future allied casualties , though at the price of very limited destruction and the loss of any shock effect . Third , NATO avoided most anti-aircraft weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-safe 15,000 feet or more . Fourth , the alliance greatly restricted its operations in less-than-perfect weather conditions . NATO officials complained that dense clouds were impeding the bombing campaign , often limiting nightly operations to a few cruise-missile strikes against fixed targets of known location . In truth , what the cloud ceiling prohibited was not all bombing -- low-altitude attacks could easily have taken place -- but rather perfectly safe bombing . <p> On the ground far beneath the high-flying planes , small groups of Serb soldiers and police in armored vehicles were terrorizing hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovars . NATO has a panoply of aircraft designed for finding and destroying such vehicles . All its major powers have antitank helicopters , some equipped to operate without base support . But no country offered to send them into Kosovo when the ethnic cleansing began-after all , they might have been shot down . When U.S. Apache helicopters based in Germany were finally ordered to Albania , in spite of the vast expenditure devoted to their instantaneous " readiness " over the years , they required more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey . Six weeks into the war , the Apaches had yet to fly their first mission , although two had already crashed during training . More than mere bureaucratic foot-dragging was responsible for this inordinate delay : the U.S. Army insisted that the Apaches could not operate on their own , but would need the support of heavy rocket barrages to suppress Serb anti-aircraft weapons . This created a much larger logistical load than the Apaches alone , and an additional , evidently welcome delay . <p> Even before the Apache saga began , NTO already had aircraft deployed on Italian bases that could have done the job just as well : U.S. A-10 " Warthogs " built around their powerful 30 mm antitank guns and British Royal Air Force Harriers ideal for low-altitude bombing at close range . Neither was employed , again because it could not be done in perfect safety . In the calculus of the NATO democracies , the immediate possibility of saving thousands of Albanians from massacre and hundreds of thousands from deportation was obviously not worth the lives of a few pilots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a large-scale disinterested intervention can fail to achieve its ostensibly humanitarian aim . It is worth wondering whether the Kosovars would have been better off had NATO simply done nothing . REFUGEE NATIONS <p> THE MOST disinterested of all interventions in war -- and the most destructive-are humanitarian relief activities . The largest and most protracted is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) . It was built on the model of its predecessor , the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency ( UNRRa ) , which operated displaced-persons ' camps in Europe immediately after World War II . The UNRWA was established immediately after the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war to feed , shelter , educate , and provide health services for Arab refugees who had fled Israeli zones in the former territory of Palestine . <p> By keeping refugees alive in spartan conditions that encouraged their rapid emigration or local resettlement , the UNRRA 'S camps in Europe had assuaged postwar resentments and helped disperse revanchist concentrations of national groups . But UNRWA camps in Lebanon , Syria , Jordan , the West Bank , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living than most Arab villagers had previously enjoyed , with a more varied diet , organized schooling , superior medical care , and no backbreaking labor in stony fields . They had , therefore , the opposite effect , becoming desirable homes rather than eagerly abandoned transit camps . With the encouragement of several Arab countries , the UNRWA turned escaping civilians into lifelong refugees who gave birth to refugee children , who have in turn had refugee children of their own . <p> During its half-century of operation , the UNRWA has thus perpetuated a Palestinian refugee nation , preserving its resentments in as fresh a condition as they were in 1948 and keeping the first bloom of revanchist emotion intact . By its very existence , the UNRWA dissuades integration into local society and inhibits emigration . The concentration of Palestinians in the camps , moreover , has facilitated the voluntary or forced enlistment of refugee youths by armed organizations that fight both Israel and each other . The UNRWA has contributed to a half-century of Arab-Israeli violence and still retards the advent of peace . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwar UNRWA , today 's Europe would be filled with giant camps for millions of descendants of uprooted Gallo-Romans , abandoned Vandals , defeated Burgundians , and misplaced Visigoths -- not to speak of more recent refugee nations such as post-1945 Sudeten Germans ( three million of whom were expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1945 ) . Such a Europe would have remained a mosaic of warring tribes , undigested and unreconciled in their separate feeding camps . It might have assuaged consciences to help each one at each remove , but it would have led to permanent instability and violence . <p> The UNRWA has counterparts elsewhere , such as the Cambodian camps along the Thai border , which incidentally provided safe havens for the mass-murdering Khmer Rouge . But because the United Nations is limited by stingy national contributions , these camps ' sabotage of peace is at least localized . <p> That is not true of the proliferating , feverishly competitive nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) that now aid war refugees . Like any other institution , these NGOs are interested in perpetuating themselves , which means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen to be active in high-visibility situations . Only the most dramatic natural disasters attract any significant mass-media attention , and then only briefly ; soon after an earthquake or flood , the cameras depart . War refugees , by contrast , can win sustained press coverage if kept concentrated in reasonably accessible camps . Regular warfare among well-developed countries is rare and offers few opportunities for such NGOs , so they focus their efforts on aiding refugees in the poorest parts of the world . This ensures that the food , shelter , and health care offered -- although abysmal by Western standards -- exceeds what is locally available to non-refugees . The consequences are entirely predictable . Among many examples , the huge refugee camps along the Democratic Republic of Congo 's border with Rwanda stand out . They sustain a Hutu nation that would otherwise have been dispersed , making the consolidation of Rwanda impossible and providing a base for radicals to launch more Tutsi-killing raids across the border . Humanitarian intervention has worsened the chances of a stable , long-term resolution of the tensions in Rwanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentments forever is bad enough , but inserting material aid into ongoing conflicts is even worse . Many NGOs that operate in an odor of sanctity routinely supply active combatants . Defenseless , they can not exclude armed warriors from their feeding stations , clinics , and shelters . Since refugees are presumptively on the losing side , the warriors among them are usually in retreat . By intervening to help , NGOs systematically impede the progress of their enemies toward a decisive victory that could end the war . Sometimes NGOs , impartial to a fault , even help both sides , thus preventing mutual exhaustion and a resulting settlement . And in some extreme cases , such as Somalia , NGOs even pay protection money to local war bands , which use those funds to buy arms . Those NGOs are therefore helping prolong the warfare whose consequences they ostensibly seek to mitigate . MAKE WAR TO MAKE PEACE <p> Too MANY wars nowadays become endemic conflicts that never end because the transformative effects of both decisive victory and exhaustion are blocked by outside intervention . Unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its evils by disinterested interventions is a new malpractice that could be curtailed . Policy elites should actively resist the emotional impulse to intervene in other peoples ' wars -- not because they are indifferent to human suffering but precisely because they care about it and want to facilitate the advent of peace . The United States should dissuade multilateral interventions instead of leading them . New rules should be established for U.N . refugee relief activities to ensure that immediate succor is swiftly followed by repatriation , local absorption , or emigration , ruling out the establishment of permanent refugee camps . And although it may not be possible to constrain interventionist NGOs , they should at least be neither officially encouraged nor funded . Underlying these seemingly perverse measures would be a true appreciation of war 's paradoxical logic and a commitment to let it serve its sole useful function : to bring peace . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Playing games : U.N . peacekeepers with refugees , Tyre , Lebanon , 1996 . <p> By Edward N.

Amplified DNA was sequenced directly by GENEWIZ , Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and alignments were compared with those of GenBank sequences by using AlignX software ( Vector NTI Advance version 11.5 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . # Of the 51 samples tested by 16S rDNA PCR , the rDNA amplicon sequences were identical for 4 ( 8% ) . Sequence comparisons of the amplified products with Ehrlichia spp. , Anaplasma spp. , and Neorickettsia risticii sequences in GenBank are summarized in the Table . Identical GroEL and sodB DNA sequences were amplified from 3 of 4 horses . # Conclusions # According to serologic , PCR amplification , and DNA sequencing results , tick-infested horses in Mrida , Nicaragua , might be infected with a potentially novel Ehrlichia species . Initial serologic screening with the rapid ELISA indicated that exposure to ? 1 Ehrlichia species is common among horses in Nicaragua ( 55% ) . For dogs , SNAP 4Dx-Plus results can be positive after exposure to E. canis , E. chaffeensis , E. ewingii , and potentially E. muris and Panola Mountain ehrlichiae ( 2 , 3 , 6 ) . Before this study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in Nicaragua was considered more likely because equine exposure has occurred in Guatemala ; this rickettsial organism is pathogenic for cats , dogs , horses , and humans ( 12 ) . However , in North America , A. phagocytophilum is transmitted by I. scapularis and I. pacificus ticks , which have not been reported in Nicaragua . In future studies of horses in Nicaragua , ticks will be collected for identification . In Guatemala , R. microplus and A. cajennense ticks were the predominant species found on cattle , whereas D. nitens and A. cajennense ticks were most commonly found on horses ( 12 ) . Of note , in Guatemala , tick infestation levels were substantially higher and body condition scores lower for horses than for cattle . Also , cattle were exposed to an agent with serologic cross-reactivity and close genetic relatedness to E. ruminantium. # The partial 16S rDNA sequences obtained from these horses most likely represent a novel species of Ehrlichia . This conclusion is further supported by sequence analysis of 2 protein-coding genes , sodB and groEL . Partial sequences from sodB and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GenBank , but they were not 100% identical to any sequences deposited to date . When 16S rDNA for rickettsiae are compared , Fournier et al . recommend that gene homology for organisms of identical species and genus be 99.8% and 98.1% , respectively ( 13 ) . Although identical species are typically defined as being &gt;99% identical with a reference sequence , the percentage identity needed to define a separate species is debated , ranging from 97% to 99.5% ( 14 ) . Calculation of values can be based on alignment methods , reference databases , and number of basepairs in the sequence . Fournier et al . recommend that for novel species identification and rickettsiae classification , protein-coding genes should be used , specifically the 4 protein-coding genes gltA , ompA , ompB , and gene D in addition to the 16S rRNA gene . To date , 16S rDNA sequences or whole-genome sequencing have been used to classify Ehrlichia species and strains . Collectively , and as depicted in the Figure ( in which phylogenetic alignment trees for all 3 genes tested in this study were constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anaplasma , Ehrlichia , and Neorickettsia ) , the genetic findings in this study support infection of horses in Nicaragua with a novel Ehrlichia species . To confirm this possibility , future efforts will focus on cell culture isolation of the Ehrlichia organism from horses in Nicaragua . # Vectorborne pathogens can infect any host species bitten by infected ticks . At least 4 Ehrlichia species have been implicated as being pathogenic for canids and humans ( 1-3 ) . Thus , future studies should also determine whether dogs , other animals , and humans in Nicaragua are exposed to and infected with this potentially novel Ehrlichia species . # Acknowledgments # We thank the Department of Biomedical Sciences , Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine , for funding this study ; the veterinary students who participated in the 2013 Nicaragua trip and helped collect the blood samples used for this study ; and Dana Riggins for technical assistance in processing samples for PCR. # This research was supported in part by the State of North Carolina and donations to the North Carolina State University College of Medicine Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laboratories Inc. # Ms. O'Nion is a student in the veterinary medical curriculum at Oregon State University .

@@4002841 The Middle of the Twentieth Century witnessed the destruction of colonial systems in many parts of Asia and Africa . In the aftermath of the Second World War , newly independent Arab states seemed to brim with the promise of rapid socioeconomic development and an enhancement of quality . of life . Today , a half century later , development , measured in terms of achievements such as the progressive elimination of poverty , unemployment and inequality , seems an elusive goal for many parts of both the Third World and the Arab World . While in terms of sheer population numbers more people are living longer , the social and economic condition of their lives is often bleak . This is true particularly for some sectors of Arab society that have been ravaged by recent warfare , famine , poverty , military occupation , and/or the corrosive influences of internal divisions or external threats . <p> Education has been linked with Arab aspirations for national development at least since the reforms of Muhammad Ali in 19th century Egypt , although it is an even older remnant of the culture-wide appreciation for learning . Education furthers the national capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the most basic level , it is a country 's primary educational system that provides the bedrock for social and economic development . This is so because schooling is of critical importance to a nation 's human resource capacity . It provides young people with the cognitive skills ( basic literacy , numeracy , communication and problem-solving skills ) upon which they can later build . Thus it is the base for " all further schooling , training , or self-education " ( A. Chantavanich et al , 1990:1 ) . In countries where resources are meager and pupil retention rates are low , primary education is not only a base , it is also the ceiling of formal education . <p> While we can not expect miracles from primal , education , we can expect beneficial outcomes ( Eisemon , 1987 ) . A large body of evidence demonstrates that completed primary . education improves agricultural productivity and , more generally , productivity at work and in the home , facilitates literacy and communication , increases individual earnings , improves health and nutritional status , raises life expectancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , for example , Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990 ; Habte et el. , 1983 ; Psacharopoulos , 1984 ; Eisemon , 1989 ) . These results , among others , are all indicators of social and economic development . To the extent that primary education can potentiate so much later growth and development , how do we assess Arab society 's preparedness and effectiveness in this area ? Often educational development is measured by the proportions of people of a given age group who are in the educational system or who have successfully completed an educational cycle . Greater proportions are seen as reflective of equality of access and equality of access is seen as an indicator of optimal utilization of human resources . <p> Yet it may well be asked : Access to what ? Access for what ? Increasingly , research attention is shifting from enumerating pupils or graduates to queries concerning educational quality . What was once regarded as a politically sensitive topic has now come center stage : <p> . . . the experiences gained in two decades of reform and intervention experiments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although cultural differences remain , the quality of education can -- and indeed should -- be subjected to technical scrutiny . ( Heyneman , 1986:3 ) <p> It is not just the existence of formal education but its nature which is at issue . Lockheed and Verspoor ( 1990:vii ) note that " the quality of primary . education in a country must be judged according to the total learning of all its children . To improve the quality of primary education , therefore , is to ensure that more of a nation 's children complete the primary cycle , having learned what is taught . " <p> In a relevant review of the literature on the quality of education and economic growth , Solmen ( 1986:14 ) observes : <p> Improvements in the quality of schooling provided in developing countries may be more important for the future economic prospects of these nations in the long run than will expanded access to poor quality education . Thus the quandary of equity versus efficiency will have to be addressed in these countries as it has been in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of schooling has more effect on the cognitive and behavior outcomes for students in developing areas than in developed areas . Fuller et al . ' s ( 1986 ) research in Mexico supports this with a study comparing levels of investment in school quality and the rates of growth a decade later . The reports from regional and international educational authorities suggest that the need to address the quality issue is nowhere more pressing than in developing countries ; even in those Arab countries where educational access is severely constrained , questions regarding the quantity . of education do not replace questions regarding educational quality ( see , for example , Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990 ; Solmort , 1986 ; Habte and Heyneman , 1983 ; Psacharopoulos , 1984 ; Eisemon , 1989 ) . <p> This paper examines issues relating to the quality of primary education in the Arab World . The study assesses the relation between excellence in education and national aspirations for socioeconomic development . The reality of development planning in the Arab world is that the constituent countries are not equivalent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailing institutional arrangements . Hence , while our arguments are necessarily general to allow broad applicability , the practical utility of this analysis is contingent on sensitivity to each Arab country 's unique social , economic , historical and cultural conditions . <p> This discussion is divided into three sections . Following a brief note on research procedure , the first section provides a critical review of trends affecting the educational climate for Arab children . Secondly , we examine the quality of Arab primary education in terms of equity of access . This will be followed by a discussion of selected indicators of educational quality . Throughout the discussion , we suggest strategies and policy options which may help to improve the state of primary education in the Arab World . DATA <p> The statistical data provided in the accompanying tables are extracted from compilations by Lockheed and Verspoor ( 1990:165ff ) . These compilations are based on the UNESCO database for education and the World Bank database for economic indicators . All the member states of the Arab League are included , with the exception of Palestine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Djibouti and Qatar ) . In these tables , the Arab states are grouped into four major economic groups based on 1986 GNP per capita data : ( 1 ) " low-income " economies ( where per capita incomes are less than $450 ) ; ( 2 ) " lower-middle-income " economies ( where per capita incomes range between $450 and $1700 ) ; ( 3 ) " upper-middle-income " economies ( where per capita incomes range between $1700 and $7425 ) ; ( 4 ) " high-income " economies ( where per capita incomes exceed $7425 ) . These four economic groups are based on the World Development Report ( World Bank , 1988 ) . <p> Empirical evidence on the quality of education in the various countries of the Arab World is rather sketchy . No government has a system of assessment in place to evaluate children 's learning success or to monitor their educational progress . Programs are implemented but rarely evaluated . Good intentions can not replace informed assessment . Until rigorous Arab evaluation programs are in place , evidence from other developing nations facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDUCATIONAL CLIMATE <p> Generally , primary educational systems in the Arab World have been characterized by both success and failure . The most outstanding success is a quantitative one , illustrating the spread of primary education to include increasing numbers of children . Since the end of World War II , educational development has been a priority in virtually every Arab country . In terms of absolute numbers , the expansion of Arab education has been particularly dramatic at the primary level , with average enrollment growth rates exceeding population growth rates by a large margin . For several Arab countries , substantial gains were made between 1950 and 1965 . But , for practically all of these countries the rate of educational growth has been even more spectacular over the last two decades . For example , between 1965 and 1985 , enrollments at the primary level in the eighteen most populous Arab states increased by 250% , or from about 10 million to over 25 million ( see Table 1 ) . This increase is equivalent to providing schooling for an additional 2,100 pupils every day for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noteworthy trends in primary education in the Arab World include the provision of more teachers , schools , buildings , curricula and resource materials . In addition , school expansion has narrowed the gender gap in access to primary education , increased the proportion of 6-11 year-olds enrolled at primary levels , and improved the " internal efficiency " ( i.e. , raised the ratio of primary . school graduates to primary school entrants ) . <p> For most of the post-Second World War period , educational budgets rose steadily , although the rate of educational growth declined somewhat during the 1980s due to deteriorating social , economic and political conditions ( Al-Bassam , 1989:70 ) . In terms of financial resources , the recurrent expenditures on primary education in many Arab countries claim around 50% of the total educational budget . The high cost of primary education coupled with the downturn in the economies of many Arab countries may limit governments ' capacity to further develop the primary educational system . <p> While successes in educational expansion are noteworthy , it is important to recognize setbacks and obstacles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in sociocultural context . Social and political events at the national and regional level can undermine the experiences of school children . At this macrolevel , in certain parts of the Arab World , including areas which were once educationally advantaged , primary education has regreressed sometimes to the point of devastation , due to internal strife , warfare or military occupation by foreign troops . For example , the ongoing internal struggle both in Sorealia and the Sudan has deprived many children of proper education . Similarly , in Lebanon the civil war which started in 1975 has had adverse effects on the educational system at all levels . During most of the civil war , primary schools experienced extended closures and lost their efficacy and moral suasion in influencing children and maintaining standards . Also , in Iraq , in the aftermath of the Gulf Wax , the mental and physical health of school children is at risk as they face devastated resources and institutions ( see Abu-Laban and Aliadin , 1991 ) . In fact the disastrous effects of the Gulf War on school children extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , close to a million Yemini workers were expelled from Saudi Arabia , severing the economic security , of large numbers of dependent Yemeni school children . Even in oil-rich Libya , school children are potentially vulnerable to geopolitical power plays as a result of the U.N . sanctions approved in mid-April 1992 . <p> A similar illustration of educational catastrophe is found in the experience of the Palestinian people in the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 . In all primary schools in the West Bank and Gaza , whether public , UNRWA or private , the system has deteriorated since the Israeli occupation . Within two months of the occupation , in August 1967 , 78 of 121 textbooks used by Palestinian children were banned and education came under the sole control of the Israeli occupation authorities ( Fasheh , 1989:516 ) . Hence , neither in the hiring nor firing of teachers , nor in the continuing technical evaluation of curriculum objectives , development of curricula or new programs , nor in school construction did the Palestinians themselves have decision-making power . The Israeli occupation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years of the intifada , for example , of 210 school days per year , primary schools in the West Bank were ordered to close 63 days in 1987-88 ; 175 days in 1988-89 ; 70 days in 1989-90 ; and 51 days in 1990-91 ( B'Tselem , 1991 ) . Such arbitrary closures wreck havoc on the education of all students but , given that they are still acquiring the basic skills necessary for independent self-education , primary students are put at particular risk . <p> What we have is a situation where entire cohorts of Arab children have their lives and their primary education disrupted by macrolevel forces rarely anticipated in formulating educational policies for developing countries . The repeated tragedies in their lives suggest that there are large numbers of Arab students with special needs which must be identified and assessed . <p> In addition , as will be illustrated in the following sections , Arab primary education is plagued by other problems including , among other things : falling short of the goal of universal primary education ; inequities in access to schools ; undertrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdated curricula ; poor quality and insufficient teaching materials ; and high dropout and repetition rates . Given that the majority of students in the Arab World do not go beyond the primary level , it is of critical importance that their education be of high quality and that they are cognitively equipped to solve new and more complex problems in their day-to-day lives . <p> While scant , the available evidence on the performance of Arab pupils in international achievement tests , national examinations , and end-of-year school examinations at different primary school levels underlines serious deficiencies in the internal efficiency of Arab primary education systems ( Massialas and Jarrar , 1987 ; 1983 ) . In other words , the process of developing children 's cognitive skills , the stated goal of primary education , is tarnished not only by deficits in the academic development of children , but also by wastage . Naturally , there are variations in efficiency across Arab countries and even within the same country , but no Arab country is exempt from the need to improve its system of primary education . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization ( ALECSO ) published a critical , future-oriented document titled/he Strategy for the Development of Arab Education which was as ambitious as it was pathbreaking . It dealt with the broad range of quantitative and qualitative problems confronting Arab education . The strategy was to be implemented in four stages within a fifteen-year span . A sequel to this publication assessed progress made in the implementation of the 1979 strategy ( Al-Bassam , 1989 ) . The results of this assessment show that Arab education is still in need of attention and qualitative improvements . The following sections will identify some of the main failings of Arab primary education and suggest remedial strategies ( see also Verspoor , 1989 ; and Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990 ) . EQUITY OF ACCESS <p> Access to education , a topic of much current research , is not limited to efforts to increase opportunities for enrollment . It includes , in addition , efforts to improve educational opportunities for all groups in society regardless of gender , geographical location or socioeconomic status , as well as efforts to increase student retention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantitative and qualitative components in the educational system and , hence , it is multidimensional in nature and can be measured in different ways . <p> An obvious and simple way of measuring overall access takes the form of comparing the total number of students attending primary school at differing points in time . This approach may be extended to cover changes over time in the magnitude of educational resources such as teachers , schools , and educational materials . The evidence on any of these indicators may be presented at different levels : on a country-by-country basis , or for regions within a country , or for the entire Arab World . <p> It should be emphasized that enrollments are not entirely a function of supply of educational resources ( i.e. schools and teachers ) ; they are also a function of demand , i.e. , interest on the part of different groups in accessing educational opportunities . On the demand side of the equation , the literature shows that there are " different patterns of access and retention among wealthy/poor , male/female , and urban/rural children " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these patterns is determined by comparing the number of students from each relevant category with the total enrollment ( e.g. , females as a percentage of all students enrolled ) . <p> As indicated earlier , the total number of students enrolled in primary schools in Arab countries increased phenomenally between 1965 and 1985 ( Table 1 ) . While absolute numbers provide a striking picture of educational growth , they are inadequate indicators of progress toward the goal of universal education . To assess this , we need to compare the number of students enrolled with the school age population ( i.e. , the 6-11 year olds ) . <p> Table 2 shows that between 1965 and 1985 , the percentages of 6-11 year olds in school rose considerably for practically all Arab countries . In 1985 , these percentages were highest in Libya , Syria , Tunisia , Iraq , Egypt , and Algeria , ranging from about 86% to 107% ; and lowest in Sudan ( 45.6% ) , Mauritania ( 33.2% ) , and Somalia ( 9.6% ) . The remainder of the Arab states were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their wide range , that for many Arab countries , considerable work needs to be done before the goal of universal education is achieved . <p> In all of the Arab countries for which information is available , the proportion of female students at the primary level has been increasing , but there are still some sharp gender inequities in access to education ( Table 1 ) . In 1985 , for example , the female percentage of the total enrollment ranged widely : 49% for Kuwait , 48% for Jordan and the U.A.E. , 47% for Lebanon and Libya , 46% for Syria , 45% for Iraq and Tunisia , 44% for Algeria and Oman , 43% for Egypt and Saudi Arabia , 40% for Sudan and Mauritania , 38% for Morocco , 34% for Somalia , 26% for the People 's Democratic Republic of Yemen , and 20% for the Arab Republic of Yemen . Those Arab governments with gender gaps in access could play critical , innovative roles in improving educational accessibility for females by establishing outreach programs directed toward eliciting community and family support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequity in educational accessibility in the Arab World relate to socioeconomic status and place of residence . In many impoverished families , children are removed from school at an early age . In addition , numerous studies indicate that rural residents are markedly disadvantaged relative to urban residents ( see , for example , Al-Bassam , 1989 ; and Cameron and Hurst , 1983:543 ) . As with the gender gap , the class and rural-urban gaps in access to primary education could be narrowed by determined action . Efficiency of the Education System <p> A useful indicator of the efficiency of the education system is the graduation or completion rate , which is defined as the ratio of the number of students who complete their primary education to the number of primary school entrants . At the aggregate level , in North Africa and the Middle East , the completion rates have steadily over the years . In the 1940s , for example , 6 out of 10 entrants completed the primary cycle , compared to about 8 out of 10 at the present time . The observe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hurst , 1983 ; and Horn and Arriagada , 1986 ) . <p> Useful as it is. the completion rate does not take account of another aspect of efficiency and that is , the frequency of grade repetition in the system . Table 3 shows that there are substantial differences among the Arab countries in grade repetition rates , which in 1985 ranged from 1.5% for Egypt to 22.9% for the Arab Republic of Yemen . Between these two extremes are : Jordan ( 4.7% ) , Kuwait ( 5.2% ) , U.A.E. ( 5.7% ) , Syria ( 7.5% ) , Algeria ( 7.5% ) , Oman ( 11.7% ) , Saudi Arabia ( 12.4% ) , Mauritania ( 18.3% ) , Morocco ( 19.8% ) , Tunisia ( 20.4% ) , and Iraq ( 20.8% ) . It is clear that the repetition rates in several Arab states are extremely high and special efforts could be made to cut down on this wasteful duplication . Strategies and Policy Implications <p> The preceding analysis indicates that Arab governments , in varying degrees , need to improve access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of educational opportunities , planners should be clear on whether education is viewed as a goal in itself , that is , a basic human right , or as a means to achieving other goals such as socioeconomic development and/or national integration . This is important because each view entails a somewhat different set of policy options and priorities . For example , if education is viewed as a basic human right , then the stress would tend to be on universality and disadvantaged groups ( such as the poor , distant communities , females , and ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ) would have to be singled out for special attention . On the other hand , if education is viewed as a vehicle for national development , the government would tend to define and target economically relevant groups , such as farmers , while emphasizing educational relevance and quality . <p> While budgetary constraints may discourage some governments from even attempting a start , this would be a missed opportunity because there are cost-effective measures that could be employed to improve both the quantity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature suggests that progress on these goals can be made without even increasing costs . The following suggestions for improving educational access are , therefore , mindful of current economic concerns . It is suggested that planners : Restructure training programs for primary school teachers . Eliminate unnecessary replication with secondary education and provide shorter , more focused programs which emphasize pedagogical training . Institute double shifts , where appropriate , as has been done rather effectively in Egypt and Yemen Arab Republic . Use existing institutions such as mosques for expanding the supply , as has been done effectively in small , distant rural settlements in Pakistan 's Sind province . Such arrangements are believed to be most effective if they take the " form of pre-schooling or after-school classes . " ( Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990:107 ) Develop distance education methods , such as interactive radio programming , and other new learning technologies that are cost-effective and consistent with the cultural traditions . Mobilize community support and involve parents and local resources as much as possible in the educational process . Target specific groups ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to support and facilitate their children 's education . Reduce wastage first , by increasing the completion rate and second , by reducing the grade repetition and dropout rates . Another noteworthy aspect of wastage concerns the production of underlearners , but unfortunately we lack systematic information on this . <p> The utility of the above noted policy options is contingent on a given country 's social , economic and cultural traditions . This means that education planners will place differential emphasis on these options to suit their local and national needs . No less important is the fact that access to education implies not only quantitative but also qualitative improvements in the education system . In fact , both of these aspects of accessibility are interrelated . The literature clearly shows that where there is emphasis on quality , a certain degree of quantitative improvement tends to follow automatically in the form of greater demand , community support . higher completion rates , and lower dropout and repetition rates . The next section of the paper examines the available evidence on educational quality and how it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructional methods and strategies , and more efficient management systems . SELECTED INDICATORS OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY <p> Educators and political leaders have long known that basic education in the Arab countries needs to be overhauled . A legacy of the colonial past , the system is in a torpid condition and both the curriculum and associated educational materials require restructuring and upgrading ( Lockheed and Vetspoor , 1990 ; Al-Bassam , 1989 ; Massialas and Jarrar , 1987 ; 1983 ; and Cameron and Hurst , 1983 ) . All efforts to improve teaching and learning have met with partial success , at best . Curriculum <p> Naturally , the curriculum plays a central role in structuring the learning experiences of students . According to Bacchus ( 1990 ) , curriculum refers to the content of both formal and informal instructional and learning experiences , instructional strategies , materials and facilities and methods of evaluating the success of curriculum goals . Implied in this definition is an important distinction between the " intended " and the " implemented " curriculum . Actual curriculum implementation brings into focus teachers and textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at the center of any efforts to improve the quality of basic education and implies . . . a coordinated effort in all the areas included . ... " ( Bacchus , 1990 ) . <p> It may be useful at this point to make a few observations about curricular content in primary schools throughout the world . The evidence suggests that , worldwide , there are remarkable similarities in the subjects taught and the relative emphasis given to these subjects , regardless of the country 's level of economic development . For example , a recent study of 130 countries representing high , medium and low-income economies , shows that at each economic level about 35% of the available time is devoted to language ; 18% to mathematics ; 8-10% each to science , social studies , music and art , and physical education ; and 5% to moral studies . The main difference is found in vocational subjects ( agriculture , domestic science and business ) , in lower-income economies , where 6-7% of the available time is devoted to these subjects , compared to only 1-2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Lockheed and Vetspoor , 1990:31 ) . <p> The curricular content in primary schools in the Arab World , . in general , is quite consistent with world patterns , but there are variations in emphasis across Arab countries . To a large degree , these variations center around greater or lesser emphasis on religious-humanistic subjects , foreign languages , and vocational and practical training . There are also differences attributable to the movements involving " Arabization " and " nationalization " , of the curriculum in Libya , Tunisia , Algeria and Morocco which began in the 1950s and 1960s . While some inter-Arab differences in curricular content are to be expected , there are educators ( e.g. , Massialas and Jarrar , 1987 ) who argue that the quality of primary education could be improved considerably by giving more attention to science and vocational and practical training and less attention to religious-humanistic subjects . This argument may be valid , but it should not be made in the abstract or in principle . To evaluate the curriculum , educators need to relate its content to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . The curriculum may be structured differently , depending on whether education is viewed as an end in itself or as a means to other goals . <p> A much more promising course of action than simply adjusting the curriculum is to critically examine its development and implementation and how these two processes may be improved . For example , in all Arab countries , without exception , the curriculum is centrally developed by education ministry officials , with help from experts . Hence , it is imposed from above , with neither the community nor teachers having much say in the process . In this connection , it is important to note that studies carried out in other developing countries emphasize the significant contributions that parents and community leaders can make to curriculum development and reform . This is even more true where educational goals are directed toward equipping students to live and work successfully within their own communities ( Bacchus , 1990 ) . Still , another potential benefit resulting from stronger community-school links is that these may enhance children 's academic performance . Hence , curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In terms of implementation , teachers are , of course , critical . Teachers <p> The curriculum 's stated goals are entrusted to teachers to achieve . It is important , therefore , to ensure teachers ' clear understanding of and commitment to these goals . How is this done ? Modern social psychology tells us that participation in decision-making enhances commitment to the decisions made . In line with this , it would be beneficial to involve the teachers in the process of curriculum development and change . As well as improving the quality and relevance of the curriculum , teachers ' involvement would also increase the likelihood that it is successfully implemented . <p> Obviously , the teacher is the most central person in curriculum implementation and in providing opportunities for learning . The quality of education is determined largely by the teacher 's knowledge of the subject matter as well as teaching skills . Current reports on teachers and teaching practices in the Arab countries are not altogether complimentary . While some countries are better off than others , it is nevertheless the case that many Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they often employ teaching methods which alienate students and discourage their participation , independent initiative , and critical thinking . Teachers tend to be strict disciplinarian and authoritarian rather than educators with a wide range of instructional strategies ( cf. Massialas and Jarrar , 1987 ) . All too often , teachers expect their students to copy from the blackboard , memorize , refrain from asking questions and avoid making mistakes . In addition to being teacher-centered , the system is also dominated by examinations . It is a system for young children which is more fear- and conformity-inducing than discovery oriented . <p> Research evidence suggests that the opportunities for learning in Arab primary schools could be improved by exposing teachers to modern teaching methods and re-orienting them to become child-centered and encouraging of self-learning ( Bude , 1990 ) . The teaching practices most conducive to learning are those that involve the student as an active participant , giving him or her the opportunity to practice and apply what is taught in his or her own life ( see Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990:42 ) . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve . In addition , the dropout , grade repetition and absenteeism rates would likely decline . Textbooks and Learning Materials <p> Recent studies and demonstration projects carried out in developing countries show that learning improves considerably with the use of textbooks , so much so that the World Bank Report on Education in Africa views textbooks as the single most important and cost-effective instrument for improving the quality of education ( Bacchus , 1990 ) . Like a good teacher , a good textbook is rare but it is necessary to have . Neumann ( 1980:11 ) delineates the qualities of a good text : <p> Just as a lesson taught by a teacher is more than chalk and talk , a textbook page , a unit , or chapter , should be more than a recital of fact or a setting out of exercises . It must be visual : offer structure , variety , and present its materials in different ways ; it should motivate , spiral , and reinforce . A textbook must be organized and divided into units that fit the classroom situation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for individualization , for the different abilities represented in the classroom . <p> Judged in terms of the above noted qualities , textbooks in the Arab countries are found to be wanting . Cameron and Hurst ( 1983:544 ) state that " textbooks and other teaching aids in the Arab countries are often in short supply , of poor quality and irrelevant content . " In a similar vein , Massialas and Jarrar ( 1983:77 ) critically note that Arabic textbooks tend to present unrealistic pictures of society and are not up to date on scientific information . In terms of physical appearance , Arabic textbooks , in general , are neither attractive to the learner nor well illustrated . Because of these and other deficiencies , it has been noted that " many ' Arab countries experienced and continue to experience a state of affairs where texts are available but not often read " ( Massialas and Jarrar , 1983:331 and 94-98 ) . There is here a clear need to improve the quality of Arabic textbooks and make them relevant to the experiences of a broad spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instructional materials have impact on the quality . of education . Learning aids , which range from exercise books and notebooks to maps , science equipment , libraries and visual aids , are in limited supply and , when available , they are unevenly distributed . Schools in smaller communities and in rural areas are most disadvantaged . In addition , teacher guides , which are normally integrated with textbooks , help the teacher to use textbooks most effectively , monitor student achievement , and adjust classroom activities to suit the learners ' needs . In Arab countries , as in other developing countries , teacher guides are seldom available . The paucity of these materials further compromises the quality of primary education . Administration and Control of Education <p> To improve teaching and learning we must also look at the administration and control of education . This is an important area because it has a bearing on teachers ' morale , creativity and effectiveness and , ultimately , on student achievement . It is clear from the preceding discussion that in almost all Arab states , all major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas such as teacher selection , training and placement , and examinations are highly centralized in ministries of education . In fact , the system also reflects a high degree of centralization at the district ( or regional ) as well as the school level . With reference to the latter level , authority resides solely in the hands of the school principal . While the principal 's authority is not absolute , circumscribed as it is by higher levels of administration , he or she tends to be a strict , authoritarian administrator , allowing little decision-making power for the teacher to innovate and be creative . School principals are usually recruited from the ranks of teachers and , therefore , they lack the necessary administrative skills as well as specialized training . Given this state of affairs , there is a glaring need to modernize educational administration in the Arab World and to create a better balance between centralization and decentralization of administrative function . Strategies and Policy Implications <p> In the past 20-30 years , there have been many attempts to improve the quality of primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some countries have been more successful than others . However , the need to intensify efforts to improve teaching and learning in all Arab countries has never been more pressing . The evidence suggests that these efforts should concentrate on several areas including curriculum development and reform , upgrading of teacher qualifications and use of modern teaching methods . and modernization of educational administration . Judging from up-to-date studies conducted in developing countries , including some Arab countries . a list of policy options is provided below . While not exhaustive , the policy options proposed below have been identified with a view to cost-effectiveness and potential promise to achieve the desired goal : Involve parents , community leaders and teachers in the process of curriculum development and reform . Invest more heavily in curriculum implementation and , in particular , the production of high quality , relevant , textbooks with integrated teacher guides . Provide a wider range of learning aids and make them available more equitably throughout the system . Institute well designed in-service teacher training programs to upgrade teachers ' qualifications and expose them to modern teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view to placing more emphasis on the development of more appropriate teaching strategies and techniques ( i.e. skills of the trade ) as well as on student teaching practice . Encourage the utilization of non-directive methods of learning in order facilitate student participation in the learning process . Encourage and reward innovative practices among teachers and support the institution of experimental programs within schools in order to improve student achievement . Provide specially designed training programs for school administrators and others within the system , in order to enhance their administrative skills and modernize the administrative system . <p> As in the case of the suggestions made earlier , the above policy options and strategies may be applied selectively , with varying degrees of emphasis , sensitive to local and national varieties . However , sooner or later , all of these options , along with others , will have to be addressed if the goal of improving the quality of primary education is to be achieved . CONCLUSION <p> Social and economic development is a multifaceted process , an important component of which concerns the educational system ( cf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primary education is based " on two considerations . First , . the evidence suggests that the social and economic impact of primary education is greater when educational quality is high . Second , with particular reference to the Arab World , a large proportion of children do not go beyond the primary level . Hence the quality of primary education should be a critical consideration in every country 's development plan . <p> Improving the quality of primary education is a highly complex task . This discussion has provided a broad assessment of educational quality in the Arab World and suggested strategies for the improvement of teaching and learning . The emphasis on student achievement is well placed because both the individual learner and society at large will benefit from such an improvement . In view of the fact that there are many factors which impinge on student achievement , it is necessary to devise an orderly , integrated approach . All things can not be accomplished at a single point in time particularly during periods of economic scarcity . On the other hand , a piecemeal approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A future-planning approach which offers a carefully sequenced and integrated agenda of change has the best chance for improving the quality of primary education in the Arab World .

@@4009441 A determined middle school principal succeeded in gaining nearly unanimous parental support for implementing a voluntary uniform program to make her at-risk school a safer and more positive place to learn . The article concisely describes the program and explains how she communicated program strengths achieving parental consensus , cooperation from the business community , and school board approval . <p> Research has consistently recognized a strong relationship between economic disadvantage and low norm-referenced test scores . Many schools with low academic achievement scores , low attendance rates , and high transiency percentages have high rates of students eligible for free or reduced lunches which researchers frequently use as a poverty indicator . Similarly , studies have found that the strongest predictor of school crime is the nature of the surrounding community , i.e. , communities with high levels of poverty and crime tend to have schools with high levels of crime ( Gottfredson and Gottfredson , 1985 ) . <p> In the Washoe County Schools , which include the cities of Reno , Sparks , and a portion of Lake Tahoe , one of the middle schools fitting the above socioeconomic profile has been working , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence . Led by Principal Debbie Feemster , the faculty , staff , and students at Traner Middle School have already improved reading scores on the norm-referenced TerraNova examinations . According to a school performance report ( 1999-2000 ) , truancy rates and the number of school suspensions have also declined with the implementation of a peer mediation program , family liaisons , and a family focus center . <p> In an effort to further enhance academic and social goals , the school 's parent/teacher organization discussed , researched , and voted to pilot a school uniform program commencing November 2000 . School officials used a variety of research studies and a manual published by the U.S. Department of Education which noted that " A safe and disciplined learning environment is the first requirement of a good school " ( 1998 ) . The manual stresses the importance of parental support and states that in recent years the strongest push for school uniforms has been initiated by parent groups-such as Traner's-seeking improved school safety . <p> Often school uniforms are less expensive than the clothing that students typically wear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a burden on some families . Districts planning to institute a uniform policy should address this issue prior to implementation . Grants of assistance have been available from federal or state agencies and from private sources , and graduates typically donate their uniforms to the school . <p> The many perceived benefits of adopting a school uniform policy are summarized in the following eclectic listing : School safety . <p> -- Decreased violence and theft . <p> <p> -- The identification of nonstudent intruders . <p> <p> -- Prevention of gang attire . School attendance . <p> -- Less embarrassment over clothing could increase attendance . <p> <p> -- The safer the school , the more likely students will attend .

Parental benefits . <p> -- Eliminating the discussion over what to wear to school . <p> <p> -- Uniforms promote efficiency and organization . <p> <p> -- Less pressure from children to purchase trendy , high-priced clothing . <p> School leaders and other stakeholders must decide whether to have a voluntary or mandatory school uniform policy . Voluntary policies are usually implemented by parental consensus through local PTAs or PTOs . Parents are not required to dress their children in uniforms , despite the fact that the policy recommends them . Under voluntary programs , schools are not required to buy uniforms for students whose parents can not afford them but most opt to do so . If children do not wear uniforms , they will not be reprimanded . A voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually implemented by a board of education or a similar administrative authority . Students are required to wear uniforms , although some exceptions-usually involving religious reasons-can be made . When parents can not afford uniforms , most schools supply them . According to the general counsel of the National Association of Secondary School Principals , " Clothing requirements are not considered a violation of their freedom of expression if there 's a valid educational reason for imposing them " ( Wingert , 1999 ) . <p> To gain firsthand experience and knowledge , Traner 's principal visited a successful mandatory school uniform program in Long Beach , California , which reportedly had achieved a 70% reduction in student discipline incidents . <p> Officials at Traner gained the support of over 90% of the parents and nearly the entire school population for a voluntary uniform program with the following goals : <p> <p> -- Increase school safety <p> <p> -- Increase attendance <p> <p> -- Identify non-students more readily <p> <p> -- Decrease the theft of clothing <p> <p> -- Prevent gang-related attire <p> The school district did not officially endorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with working out such details as locating a low-priced uniform that would be popular with students and finding a source of funding to purchase uniforms for students who could not afford them . <p> Students were given the opportunity to participate in the uniform selection process , choosing tops in either of their school colors ( red or white ) and khaki-colored pants , skorts , or shorts . The school benefitted when a large discount store offered to individually size each student and order the uniforms-and at a greatly discounted rate . For example , students were able to purchase pants retailing for $20 for $12.50 . Tops and lined windbreakers with the school logo were sold for $14.00 and $22.00 , respectively . For the initial year of the pilot program , students were allowed to choose their own footwear , with white basketball shoes being recommended . Fridays were designated " casual days " when students could dress in regular attire . <p> The fund for purchasing uniforms for students who could n't afford them was quickly established with monetary gifts from a number of unsolicited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased washers and dryers so students could do their own laundry and received a grant to transport students staying late for homework or laundry duties . <p> According to the principal , when Traner 's uniform policy began implementation in November , the majority of students and about 70% of the faculty and staff wore uniforms , but as the school year ended seven months later , voluntary participation by students had dropped to about 50% . Although many of the goals of the uniform policy were at least partially successful , Ms. Feemster 's recommendation was the official adoption by the school board of a mandatory program . <p> Research regarding the effectiveness of school uniform implementation remains inconclusive . Supported by studies which indicate that school uniforms have little influence in reducing delinquency or gang activity , parents of a few students in districts with mandatory school uniform dress codes have challenged such policies in court ( ETS , 1998 ) .

When I was there for the first time , all the lights were out , there were no cars , and all you saw was a 1939 Dodge . Today they are wearing miniskirts and leather jackets in Shanghai . What is the history of the world 's economy ? What is the history of invention ? Where are we going in the next generation , not my generation , but maybe our children 's or their children 's generations ? <p> One of the things I did was look at the history of invention . I think it is fairly accurate . What I did was take a look at inventions across time . What are the greatest inventions ? In the earliest times we saw the inventions coming from the Near East . In the Classical World , which was from 400 B.C. to 200 A.D. , we saw a shift to Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that crossroad . In the Middle Ages , we see things like the crossbow , the sea rudder , the magnetic compass .

They are coming from Italy , essentially from what we would call Western Europe , Germany , China , with a lot from Germany . <p> In the Renaissance , again moving forward in history , we see inventions coming from Italy and England . We see England starting to appear on the world stage now . England at this time was becoming a major commercial sea power , and it was again a trading country , a huge trading country . <p> Then in the Industrial Revolution , a large portion of the inventions all of a sudden shift to England . lron smelting with coke , again , not the tremendous flash of light but things that were innovative , cast steel , chlorine bleach , the steam carriage , the electric battery , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Fulton with the steam boat .

The United States introduced the phonograph . One thing this tells us is the benefit of being humble because we have seen great inventions coming from many , many countries other than the United States and Canada , with the radio from Italy and the diesel engine from Germany . <p> Then in the first half of the 20th century , we again see inventions largely in the United States and some in Western Europe . For example , there was the airplane , nylon , the cyclotron , radar , and things like . that .

We can not sit back and say is it not terrible that the Japanese are running us out of business by changing their cars every two years or one year or whatever . That is innovation . That is the competitive world in which we exist . And by the way , if you were to put China on the map , you would see that about 400 B.C. , China came on the scene , and it dropped off the world stage for innovation in about 1300 when it had the mechanical printing press , but in the meantime it had other great inventions like paper and so forth . <p> The bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation in Japan ?

That is a discovery . Inventions are a step on the other side , and then innovation is somewhere on the other side of that . It is in the innovative area where the Japanese are leading the world , and you can not put a number on it , but I can show you a headline . <p> This is a headline from the Wall Street Journal of March 7 , 1995 and it says , " Koreans Move to Grab Memory Chip Market From the Japanese , " and it describes the reaction of the Japanese to the moves , and the investment by the Koreans in memory chips .

These countries are doing a lot better , and that is the invention , and so if we think in terms of how many patents they have or what they have done , you are stuck . <p> We heard this morning from the Department of Commerce on how successful our policies were , what they were producing , no real statistical measure .

A Harvard Study Team estimates that at least 170,000 Iraqi children under the age of five will die within the next year from the delayed effects of the war in the Persian Gulf if the imposition of the sanctions continues . 7 .

Malnutrition has become severe and widespread in Iraq since imposition of the embargo and the war due to severe food shortages and the inflation of food prices of up to 1000% , which has effectively priced many Iraqis , especially the poor and disadvantaged , out of the food market . 10 . Cholera , typhoid , and gastroenteritis have become epidemic throughout Iraq since the war due to the critical scarcity of medicine and the inability of Iraq to process sewage and purify the water supply . 11 . The system of medical care has broken down in Iraq , resulting in the closure of up to 50% of Iraq 's medical facilities due to acute shortages of medicines , equipment , and staff . 12 .

The summer heat in Iraq has both accelerated the spread of disease and impeded its treatment due to the lack of refrigeration facilities even in hospitals . 16 . The acute shortages of food in Iraq , the inflation of up to 1000% in food prices caused by these shortages , the critical scarcity of medicine , and the essential need to reconstruct Iraq 's capacity to generate electricity to enable sewage treatment and water purification , can not be addressed or rectified without Iraq 's re-entry into global commerce , at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate lifting of the sanctions would drastically reduce the number of Iraqi children who will die in the upcoming months from malnutrition and disease and would relieve the suffering of the innocent Iraqi population which is now bearing the burden of the embargo . 18 . Approximately 500 Iraqi children are dying each day from disease , malnutrition , and lack of proper medical treatment due to the continuation of the international economic embargo and bilateral economic sanctions upon Iraq that have been organized and imposed by the Respondents . <p> III . CONTENTIONS 19 . The Harvard Study Team Report , Public Health in Iraq After the Gulf War , estimated that as of May 1991 , 55,000 additional deaths of Iraqi children under five had already occurred because of the Gulf Crisis , and projected that at least 170,000 Iraqi children under five will die in the coming year from the delayed effects of the Gulf Crisis . The Study also emphasized that these projections are conservative : " In all probability , the actual number of deaths of children under five will be much higher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Iraq prevents the massive infusion of international humanitarian assistance necessary to prevent these mortality projections from becoming a reality . The Harvard Report directly raises the question whether Respondents are responsible for the commission of the international crime of genocide against the Applicants , The 4.5 Million Children of Iraq , because of their obstinate insistence that economic sanctions be maintained in order to produce the deposition of the President of Iraq despite the fact that the original purpose for their imposition was achieved with the so-called " liberation " of Kuwait . 21 . Respondent United States of America is a Contracting Party to the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948 , which will hereinafter be referred to as " the Genocide Convention " for sake of convenience . 22 . Article I of the Genocide Convention provides that the Contracting Parties confirm that genocide , whether committed in time of peace or in time of war , is a crime under international law , which they undertake to prevent and to punish . 23 . Article II of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : <p> Article II . In the present Convention , genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such : <p> ( a ) Killing members of the group ; <p> ( b ) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; <p> ( c ) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ; <p> ( d ) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; <p> ( e ) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . 24 . Article III of the Genocide Convention provides that the following acts shall likewise all be punishable : ( a ) genocide ; ( b ) conspiracy to commit genocide ; ( c ) direct and public incitement to commit genocide ; ( d ) attempt to commit genocide ; ( e ) complicity in genocide. 25 . According to Article IV of the Genocide Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumerated in Article III shall be punished , whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials , or private individuals . This basic requirement of the Genocide Convention is fully applicable to Respondent George Bush . 26 . According to Article V of the Genocide Convention , the Contracting Parties undertake to enact , in accordance with their respective Constitutions , the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Genocide Convention and , in particular , to provide effective penalties for persons guilty of genocide or of any of the other acts enumerated in Article III . 27 . Pursuant to Article V , the Congress of the United States of America adopted what is called implementing legislation for the Genocide Convention that makes genocide a crime under U.S. federal criminal law . Basically following the terms of the Genocide Convention , this Genocide Convention Implementation Act of 1987 ( found in Title 18 of the United States Code ) defines the crime of " genocide " as follows : <p> 1901 . Genocide <p> ( a ) BASIC OFFENSE -- Whoever , whether in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance described in subsection ( d ) and with the specific intent to destroy , in whole or in substantial part , a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group as such <p> ( 1 ) kills members of that group ; <p> ( 2 ) causes serious bodily injury to members of that group ; <p> ( 3 ) causes the permanent impairment of the mental faculties of members of the group through drugs , torture , or similar techniques ; <p> ( 4 ) subjects the group to conditions of life that are intended to cause the physical destruction of the group in whole or in part ; <p> ( 5 ) imposes measures intended to prevent births within the group ; or <p> ( 6 ) transfers by force children of the group to another group ; or attempts to do so , shall be punished as provided in subsection ( b ) . 28 . According to subsection ( d ) , the basic offense must be committed either within the United States , or by a national of the United States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fine of not more than $1 million and imprisonment for life . The penalty for violating subsections ( a ) ( 2 ) to ( a ) ( 6 ) is a fine of not more than $1 million or imprisonment for not more than twenty years , or both . 29 . Under the definitional provisions of this Act , 225,000 dead Iraqi children clearly constitute a " substantial part " of " a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group as such . " The continuation of economic sanctions against Iraq will ( 1 ) kill at least 170,000 more Iraqi children by the end of the year ; ( 2 ) " cause serious bodily injury to " Applicants , The 4.5 Million Children of Iraq ; ( 3 ) " cause the permanent impairment of the mental faculties of " Applicants ; and ( 4 ) subject Applicants " to conditions of life that are intended to cause the physical destruction of the group in whole or in part .... " 30 . Only the " specific intent " of Respondent George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond a reasonable doubt to establish his criminal responsibility under United States municipal law and international criminal law . The open publication and widespread dissemination of the Harvard Report on 22 May 1991 makes that task possible . Any Bush administration official responsible for implementing the economic sanctions policy against Iraq who has knowledge of the conclusions of the Harvard Report would possess the " specific intent " required to serve as the mental element or mens rea of the international and municipal crime of genocide against Applicants , The 4.5 Million Children of Iraq . Applicants assert that Respondent George Bush has full knowledge of the genocidal consequences of the continuation of economic sanctions against Iraq and therefore has the mens rea necessary for committing the crime of genocide as recognized by the Genocide Convention and the Genocide Implementation Act . 31 . The same principles of international criminal law have been incorporated into the municipal legal systems of almost all States in the World Community today . Wherefore , there is universality of jurisdiction for any State to prosecute Respondent George Bush for committing genocide against the Applicants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pirate , the Respondent George Bush is hostis humani generis -- the enemy of all humankind . <p> IV . COMPETENCE 32 . Article I of the Genocide Convention makes it quite clear that all 99 states that are Contracting Parties have an international legal obligation " to prevent " the commission of genocide against Applicants , The 4.5 million children of Iraq . 33 . Article VIII of the Genocide Convention provides that any Contracting Party " may call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action under the Charter of the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide ... " 34 . Thus , all 99 states parties to the Genocide Convention have both the right and the duty under international law to bring the genocidal situation in Iraq to the attention of the entire United Nations Organization , as well as its affiliated organizations such as UNESCO , UNICEF , etc. 35 . The Genocide Convention expressly confers international legal competence upon all organs of the United Nations -- including the Security Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary General , the International Court of Justice , the U.N . Commission on Human Rights , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , UNESCO , UNICEF , etc. -- to do something about the genocidal situation in Iraq . But so far , such individual steps and collective actions by Member States have not been taken for fear of running afoul of the all-powerful Respondents , who represent and constitute the only self-styled " superpower " sitting as one of the five Permanent Members of the Security Council . 36 . The Respondents bear ultimate legal responsibility for the imposition of economic sanctions upon Iraq and therefore for the international crime of genocide against Applicants , The 4.5 Million Children of Iraq . 37 . Under the current desperate circumstances , responsible officials of Member States permitting the continuation of economic sanctions against Iraq could commit the separate international crime of " complicity " in the crime of genocide that is today being inflicted upon the Applicants by the Respondents , in violation of Article III(e) of the Genocide Convention . <p> V. JURISDICTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations , including the Secretary General , the Economic and Social Council , the General Assembly , the Human Rights Commission , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , UNESCO and UNICEF , inter alia , have the jurisdiction to receive and hear this Indictment , Complaint and Petition , and to provide the Relief requested herein . 39 . That the organs of the United Nations are endowed with explicit and inherent powers to assume jurisdiction of cases of the kind presented in this Indictment , Complaint and Petition is reflected in the Charter of the United Nations . Chapter 1 , Article 1(1) of the Charter obligates the United Nations and its members to " maintain international peace and security . " Such peace and security are threatened by many acts short of open interstate warfare . Genocide by the Respondents against the Applicants , The 4.5 Million Children of Iraq , threatens international peace and security . 40 . As the situation described above constitutes a constant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security , the Secretary General , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is entitled to bring this matter to the attention of the Security Council . He is also authorized by Rule 13(g) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly to include in the Assembly 's agenda any item which he deems it necessary to put before the Assembly . Applicants hereby request the Secretary General to include their Indictment , Complaint , and Petition on the agenda of the 46th General Assembly , and to bring it to the attention of the Security Council . 41 . The General Assembly is authorized to act under Chapter IV , Article 22 of the United Nations Charter to establish an ad hoc Tribunal empowered to grant the Relief requested herein . For instance , in 1950 , the General Assembly established a special tribunal to deal with various claims arising in the former Italian colony of Libya . Given the circumstances detailed in this Indictment , Complaint and Petition , the creation of such a Tribunal would be justified and necessary to carry out the very Purposes and Principles for which the United Nations was established : to ensure peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . Applicants request the 46th General Assembly to establish such a Tribunal as a subsidiary organ and to charge it with the responsibility to investigate and adjudicate their Indictment , Complaint and Petition , as well as to order all forms of Relief requested in Section VI herein . 42 . That all Members of the United Nations have pledged themselves under U.N . Charter Chapter IX Articles 55 and 56 to take action to ensure respect for human rights . Article 55 states in part : <p> With a view to the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , the United Nations shall promote : <p> ( c ) universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion . <p> Article 56 states : <p> All Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that under the Charter , Member States must be prepared to take action to assist in enforcing and protecting human rights . Should an organ of the United Nations determine that the rights of Applicants were violated by Respondents and recommend action , Member States have pledged themselves to co-operate with the United Nations in taking necessary steps under the Charter to promote " universal respect for , and observance of , human rights . " 44 . These human rights provisions of the United Nations Charter were further elaborated upon and specified by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was adopted by consensus by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 . The Universal Declaration of Human Rights enunciates the basic standards of international human rights law to which all individuals around the world are entitled . Indeed , it is the official position of the United Nations Organization and of the Respondent United States of America that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is binding upon all States and for the benefit of all People around the world as a matter of customary international law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Applicants by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that are currently being systematically violated by the Respondents , the most sacred and most fundamental right of all is their very right to life itself , as recognized by Article 3 thereof : " Everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person . " Respondents act as if the " everyone " referred to in Article 3 does not include the Applicants , The 4.5 Million Children of Iraq . 46 . Applicants also assert that the Respondents have grossly , consistently , and systematically violated the fundamental right that has been guaranteed to them by Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights : " No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . " 47 . Applicants , The 4.5 Million Children of Iraq , also assert that the Respondents have violated all of the rights guaranteed to them by the International Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989. 48 . Applicants also assert that the Respondents have violated the special protections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Additional Protocol I thereto of 1977. 49 . Under the human rights provisions of the United Nations Charter , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the Genocide Convention , the Children 's Convention , and the Fourth Geneva Convention and Protocol I , Applicants are proper parties to invoke the jurisdiction of the United Nations in requesting Relief on their own behalf in order to be relieved from the inhuman , degrading , cruel , criminal , and genocidal conditions perpetrated upon them by the Respondents . 50 . Due to the fact that the Respondents represent and constitute the only self-styled " superpower " sitting as one of the five Permanent Members of the Security Council , the Respondents have repeatedly and abusively used and threatened to use their voting power and their so-called " veto power " to continue the international economic embargo upon Iraq in a manner that is ultra vires the " primary responsibility " for the maintenance of international peace and security that has been conferred upon the Security Council by Article 24(1) and ( 2 ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these duties the Security Council shall act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations . " According to Article 1(3) of the Charter , one of the foremost Purposes of the United Nations is proclaimed to be " ... promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all ... " 51 . That as a direct result of the illegal and ultra vires conduct by the Respondents at the Security Council , the Applicants have nowhere else to turn for Relief except to the General Assembly , the Secretary General , the Economic and Social Council , the Human Rights Commission , the Sub-commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , UNESCO and UNICEF , etc. in order to save themselves from the death , disease , malnutrition , starvation and genocide that is currently being inflicted upon them by the Respondents . 52 . That the General Assembly has the inherent power to create methods and instrumentalities to carry out the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations Charter , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the Genocide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Secretary General also possesses inherent powers to carry out these Purposes and Principles . The same is true for the Human Rights Commission , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , as well as for UNESCO and UNICEF , etc. 53 . That the Respondents represent and constitute a Member State of the United Nations and therefore would be obligated to act in compliance with any determination by any United Nations organ concerning this matter . <p> VI . PRAYER FOR RELIEF 54 . Applicants pray for the issuance of a Directive by the Secretariat , or the General Assembly , or the Economic and Social Council , or the Human Rights Commission , or the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , or UNESCO , or UNICEF or any other competent organ or agency of the United Nations to hear this Indictment , Complaint and Petition ; to investigate and adjudicate the allegations of genocide by Respondents against Applicants ; and to order the termination of all forms of multilateral and bilateral economic sanctions against Iraq . 55 . Applicants also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq by the United Nations Organizations as a whole , its specialized agencies and affiliated organizations , as well as by all Member States thereof , in order to save them from death , disease , malnutrition , starvation , genocide , and extermination at the hands of the Respondents . 56 . Applicants also pray for due compensation to be paid by Respondents to Applicants and their families for the deaths as well as physical and mental injury caused by Respondents ' actions in violation of the Genocide Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , inter alia. 57 . Applicants pray that proper sanctions be taken against Respondents for any refusal to comply with any of the orders or decisions that the United Nations or any international organ makes in relation to this matter . 58 . Applicants pray that the United Nations authorize a full investigation of the matters presented in this Indictment , Complaint and Petition and subsequently authorize a complete and public disclosure of all evidence and findings of fact at the conclusion of such investigation . 59 . Applicants further pray that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of all the Member States thereof -- institute criminal proceedings against Respondent George Bush for committing the international crime of genocide against the Applicants , as required by the Genocide Convention and the municipal legal systems of all civilized nations , including his own . <p> VII . CONCLUSION <p> THE PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD MUST NOT TURN THEIR EYES AWAY IN SHAME FROM IRAQ AS HUMANKIND APPROACHES THE DAWN OF THE NEXT MILLENNIUM OF ITS PARLOUS EXISTENCE . AS IRAQ 'S CHILDREN GO , SO GOES THE ENTIRE WORLD ! PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> 
@@4003241 Section : Africa Rights Monitor <p> I spent a full four weeks in South Africa from February 7 to March 7 , 1991 , the length of the visa granted me by the South African government . My last visit was in 1954 , thirty-seven years ago . During all those intervening years , although I traveled frequently to Africa , I was never allowed into South Africa . I was one of quite a company of " prohibited immigrants , not looked upon as desirable by the regime which espoused apartheid . Now things are beginning to change . Although it took three months for my visa to come through , it finally did , to my relief and great satisfaction . The trip was exhilarating , but there was an air of unreality about it , for even two years ago I did not think I would ever be able to enter South Africa . <p> Everyone who travels knows there is a difference between being inside a country -- on the ground , so to speak -- and just reading or talking about it : that which was distant becomes close up ; that which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , becomes your own . It takes on life . It is the difference between reading a review of a play or a report of a great sports event and actually being on the spot for the performance . I have followed events in South Africa over the years since the early ' 50s , probably as closely as anyone . I could recite familiar statistics about the 17 million Africans who have been arrested in the last 30 years for being in areas reserved for white ; or the 3 + million Africans who have been dispossessed because they lived on land claimed for whites ; or the 80,000 people detained for years without trial ; or the 40,000 South Africans who have been in exile . But these are cold statistics which take on a new reality as one visits the notorious Robben island prison ( as I did ) off Cape Town and talks with political prisoners who , in some cases , have just begun 25 year sentences ; or goes to the African townships -- Soweto , Alexandra , Guguletu , Crossroads -- and sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people living in hovels , that are the everyday plight of millions of black South Africans ; or stands on the spot in Sharpeville where , in 1960 , the police gunned down 69 nonviolent protesters , and wounded 180 in an anti-pass demonstration which played such a crucial role in changing the nature of the liberation struggle ; or sees burned-out houses in the African township of Mpophomeni in Natal , evidence of Inkatha attacks . <p> Let me try to summarize my impressions of South Africa under a number of headings . Is South Africa Really Changing ? <p> This was one of my first and most persistent questions . The answer which emerged is yes -- changes are taking place which help to create a different atmosphere . The fact that I and others who were prohibited from the country can now enter is a minor , but symbolic , change . Thirty-seven years ago I was tailed by police and finally picked up for interrogation when I was in the company of banned Africans . This time there was no surveillance . Why pay attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders are moving around at will and the ban is lifted on the African National Congress ( ANC ) , the Pan-Africanist Congress ( PAC ) , and even the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) ? <p> There are too many changes , large and small , to make a comprehensive list , but among them are : Integration of beaches around Cape Town , Port Elizabeth , and Durban . Suspension of prosecutions under the Group Areas Act ( even before the act is officially rescinded ) . The release of increasing numbers of political prisoners . For example , 31 were released from Robben Island on March 21 , including one of the two I talked with when I visited the prison on February 19 . Surprising confessions by government leaders . For instance , on February 20 Deputy Foreign Minister Leon Wessels said , " We now know that by apartheid ! we hurt our fellow countrymen . It was a horrible mistake that blighted our land . " Discussions between the non-racial sports associations and the traditional all-white groups , seeking an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non-racial and an all-white rugby organization , mediated by the ANC in Cape Town on February 27 . Agreement was reached to bring them together in the South African Rugby Football Union . The convening of a broadly representative church conference last November at Rustenburg which brought the main line Dutch Reformed churches and apartheid-minded evangelical denominations together with the churches that have long condemned apartheid as a sin . This was the first such conference in thirty years The revelation by the pastor of a large church in a basically white community in Port Elizabeth that members he had lost by his outspoken opposition to apartheid were beginning to come back , influenced by de Klerk 's initiatives . <p> Many more examples could be given . It is possible to take a somewhat cynical attitude towards these changes by observing that they have been forced on the government and the white minority by sanctions , by resolute opposition inside the country , and by the suffering of hosts of people . However , the fact is that changes are occurring . The talk about a " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Struggle Over ? <p> Will there now be an easy transition to a non-racial society ? This was apparently the perception of many in the United States and the international community following the speech of President F. W. de Klerk at the opening of Parliament on February 1 , in which he said he would call for the rescindment of the Group Areas Act , the Land Acts , and the Population Registration Act . However , no South Africans that I spoke with had this perception . I recalled Archbishop Tutu 's statement : " In this country we have so many people who want to change so long as things remain the same " Trevor Manuel , a leader of the United Democratic Front and publicity director for the ANC in Cape Town , said to me , " We thought we would see the light at the end of the tunnel when the ban was lifted on the ANC and Mandela was released , but not so . " When I asked Yusuf Cachalia , the former Secretary General of the South African Indian Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still in place , the tribal homelands still exist , the racially divided tri-cameral parliament is still in session with no African participation , and the black majority still have no vote . The problems to be overcome are daunting . <p> The U.S. Ambassador to South Africa , William Swing , with whom I spent an hour in Cape Town , pointed out that 5 percent of South Africans ( nearly all white ) own 88 percent of the total wealth . Unemployment in African townships is close to 50 percent . It is sobering to visit African townships and see the horrendous conditions . In Alexandra township , north-east of Johannesburg with a population of 200,000 , 75 percent of the dwellings have no electricity or running water . <p> While I was in Johannesburg , a survey made by the Star newspaper reported that in the Transvaal , despite the fact that the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act ( allowing discrimination in public facilities ) had been rescinded , only six of the 47 towns investigated had removed racial barriers . <p> Shortly thereafter , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conservative Party is proud of it . " This party , which splintered from the National Party of de Klerk , is committed to a racially partitioned South Africa . The Citizen newspaper , close to the government in point of view , reported on March 7 , the day I left South Africa , that " leaders of the right are all convinced that their people would fight and be prepared to enter into an armed struggle if a new political dispensation did not accomodate their ideals of separation and private property rights " One of the strongest right-wing groups , the Afrikoaner Weerstandsbewging ( AWB ) , headed by Eugene Terreblanche , announced that the organization had provided paramilitary training for several thousand of its members , now formed into commandos . <p> It is worrisome to talk with some ordinary whites -- taxi drivers , for example . Almost without fail , if I was in a taxi driven by a white the driver would comment on the large number of blacks on the streets . In the Hillbrow section of Johannesburg , where I was staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The drivers invariably commented that 20 years ago there would not have been a single black there . And one said , " It is a bad mistake to turn over the government to these people " Yet , the shops in central Johannesburg now sell more to blacks than to whites . Is There Serious Conflict Ahead ? <p> The answer is probably yes . As Beyers Naude , the renowned church leader who was banned for years along with his anti-apartheid Christian Institute , said to me , " The real crunch is yet to come . " The showdown about what course South Africa will take is near , but it has not yet taken place . The government has taken some courageous initiatives by lifting the ban on antiapartheid liberation movements and organizations , by releasing many of their leaders from jail ( Mandela most prominently ) , and by beginning the process of allowing political exiles back into the country . De Klerk has won some respect from many opponents of apartheid for this , even though , they point out , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With the exception of the extreme right wing , and perhaps the extreme black nationalist left , there is an area of general agreement on what a " new South Africa " will be . It will be a country in which the vote will be available to all regardless of race , and in which the government will be representative of all the people . There is agreement , therefore , that a new constitution must be framed . But beyond that , differences are great , and herein lies the area of conflict . The principle negotiators are the National Party , which forms the government , on one side , and the ANC and its allies on the other . The ANC , of course , is not the only opposition group . The PAC is very much in evidence , but it probably does not have the same mass following as the ANC at this point . Furthermore , the ANC and the PAC have better relations now than at any time since their split in 1959 . Just three days before my arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 30 years . The ANC and the PAC are even talking about forming a patriotic front before beginning formal negotiations with the government , much as the Zimbabwe African National Union and the Zimbabwe African People 's Union did in Zimbabwe . <p> Other political organizations of influence include the Azanian People 's Organization ( AZAPO ) , the head of a number of black consciousness groups ; the Inkatha Freedom Party , which started as a Zulu cultural organization , then transformed itself into a political group centered in Natal province ; the Democratic Party , with a small following composed mainly of liberal whites ; and the Conservative Party , which opposes the government 's steps toward dismantling apartheid and has taken the position of refusing to negotiate with the ANC or its allies . <p> There are two areas of significant difference between the contending forces . The first has to do with the process which will lead to the drafting of a new constitution based on universal suffrage . The government wants to avoid any popular vote before a new constitution is in place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose purpose would be to draft the constitution as was done in Namibia . The National Party also opposes the idea of an interim government , arguing that its own government is now in place and can not abdicate responsibility . The current government wants to maintain control of the process . <p> The ANC , on the other hand , strongly favors the election of a representative Constituent Assembly . The ANC feels confident it could win significant support in such an election , giving it the opportunity to exercise initiatives now denied the organization . The government has no intention of allowing this to happen . <p> George M Houser is Coodinator of the Southern Africa Education Program at the Stony Point Center , Cickettown Rd . Stony Point , NY 10980 He was Executive Director of the American Committee on Africa ( ACOA ) from 1954 to 1981 . He has been associated with Africa Today since its founding : from 1954 to 1967 it was the journal of the ALCOA , and since 1967 Dr. Houser has been a member of Africa Today Associates His most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glimpses of Africa 's Liberation Struggle ( New York : Pilgrim Press ' 1989 ) . ARM is pleased to present his observations of the changing scene in South Africa where the struggle for human rights is at a critical stage <p> Both sides agree to the interim step of holding an All-Party Conference ( APC ) . No date has been set for this conference , but it could not meet before the ANC has its long-awaited national conference in July . Also , there is no announced agreement on who would qualify to participate in the APC . There must be some way of limiting participation to organizations with a serious following . One informal list I saw in a government office in Pretoria included about 50 organizations , some with infinitesimal followings from one of the homelands or from small Indian or Coloured parties represented in the tricameral parliament . A multiplicity of organizations will strengthen the government 's position by offsetting the popular following of the ANC , but the National Party should realize that if it tries to exercise tight control of the APC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different agendas in mind for this all-party gathering . The government would like it to frame the constitution and be followed by a referendum , seeking the approval of voters , especially whites . The ANC would like the APC to be limited to framing principles for a constitution , mapping out a bill of rights , and electing a constitutional assembly to actually draft and adopt the documents . An interim transitional government might emerge from this process . <p> The second area of difference between South African political organizations has to do with the end product of the constitutional process . The government leans toward a federation and a decentralization of power . Power sharing is the key phrase . In this way more regional and local control could be exercised . This would tend to put the white minority in a stronger position . The ANC favors a strong , unitary , non-racial , parliamentary government . The difference between the two approaches can perhaps be seen in the first steps being made toward school desegregation . It is now possible for formerly all-white schools to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . However , 80 percent of the parents must vote on the issue , and a majority of 72 percent must approve the desegregation . Even then there is a limit on non-white students of 20 percent of the student body . This is the kind of local option envisioned by the current government . The ANC approach would be quite different . They would simply make segregation illegal . <p> These differences are grounds for real conflict , both in devising a constitution and in creating the kind of government to be installed . No one knows where it will all end . Obviously , the kind of government in place makes a difference in handling basic issues : for instance , in dealing with the claims of whole African communities whose land has been taken from them by whites under the Group Areas or the Land Acts , in equalizing educational opportunities , and in confronting the horrendous housing conditions in urban areas . An ANC-dominated government would lean toward nationalizing major resources and available land . The National Party desires a decentralized government which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acts , which has now been done , will not solve the problem Africans do not have money to buy back land taken from them . The trend for landless rural Africans is to move to the urban areas where they become squatters living in make-shift shacks under unbelievable crowded conditions . Already some 7 million Africans share these circumstances . The problem of inequities in land ownership can be exacerbated as the rich buy the land made available unless this is strictly controlled by government regulations . Can The Whole Process Break Down ? <p> Obviously it can . This is a precarious time in South African history . A moment of truth lies just ahead when the rewards of agreement between contending sides can be great and the tragedy of failure enormous . One thinks of other such critical moments in the struggle for independence in Africa : for example , early 1960 in the Belgian Congo . Following a round table conference in Brussels , the government of Belgium announced a date for independence in six months . The announcement was greeted with universal acclaim , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by several years of chaos . Early 1975 in Angola is another example . A transitional government designed to lead to elections and independence in ten months was set up . The outbreak of civil war , exacerbated by the cold war and large scale international intervention , destroyed the possibility of peace . A more hopeful example is 1989 in Namibia , where elections led the way to the establishment of a government that has brought peace and stability thus far . This period leading toward an APC , and a possible Constituent Assembly , is just such a critical moment South African history . <p> This is a transitional time in South Africa . To succeed , the main political actors must be transformed . The anti-apartheid organizations must be transformed from liberation movements dedicated to the overthrow of the white minority government to political parties engaged in discussion and essentially nonviolent action to bring about change . The government , on the other hand , and those who have profited from the exploitative apartheid system , must be prepared to give up power . One white person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me this way : the process is like peeling an onion . The white minority will be stripped of its power and special privilege layer by layer rather than by cutting through the onion with a knife in one quick motion . <p> The obstacles to a peaceful transition are formidable . The determination of the white right to resist change is one such obstacle . Yet , of all the people I talked with ( such as Walter Sisulu of the ANC ; General Secretary Benny Alexander of the PAC ; Helen Suzman , veteran liberal ; Boy Geldenhuys , National Party member of Parliament ; church leaders like Frank Chikane , etc. ) , not one believed the right wing could make a successful coup . The right is itself divided among the Rambo types who talk of guerrilla war , the theoreticians who unrealistically hope for a peaceful partition of the country , and the frightened ones who arm themselves because they know not what else to do . The feeling I got was that the right can cause problems at the edges , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its lunatic fringe . According to a recent document made available while I was in South Africa , one group called the Boer Republic Army , patterned after the IRA , has a hit list of leaders and organizations including not only the ANC , the PAC , and the SACP , but also petrol stations owned by Shell and British Petroleum , and representatives of the Ford Foundation , the Carnegie Foundation , and even the CIA . <p> Another obstacle to a peaceful transition is the bloodshed wrought by fighting among essentially black groups . This began in Natal where Chief Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom Party has its main strength among the Zulus , and it has spread to African townships in the Transvaal where migrant workers from various ethnic groups are housed in hostels . I am not an admirer of Inkatha or Buthelezi . Although I appreciated the fact that Buthelezi refused to allow KwaZulu to become an independent Bantustan , his political philosophy has been conservative and his own rule autocratic . No African can be employed in KwaZulu who does not sign a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , in which more than a hundred traditional Zulu chiefs serve , is a rubber stamp for Buthelezi . <p> John Aitchison , with whom I spent an evening , directs the Centre for Adult Education at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg . He has made a most intensive analysis of the violence in Natal and reported in one of his studies that the " big war " began in September 1987 , when Inkatha instituted forced recruitment into its ranks and young residents of the area resisted , particularly those affiliated with the UDF . It is dangerous to oppose Buthelezi in Natal . The day before I arrived in Pietermaritzburg , Chief Maphumulo , who was sympathetic to the UDF and the ANC , was murdered outside his home by an unknown assailant . I spent several hours on February 28 in the African township of Mpophomeni , whose people are know to be sympathetic to the ANC . I saw the damage done to some houses and a Catholic church by Inkatha attacks in April 1990 . <p> Although hooliganism may be a factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Transvaal townships , political controversy is more deeply involved . The meetings between Mandela and Buthelezi in Durban , one of which took place just before I arrived in South Africa and the other on March 30 , did not end this conflict . The question is , would it be possible to have peaceful elections in Natal under present circumstances ? Most people I talked with were skeptical . <p> A third obstacle to a peaceful transition is the problem of long-term unity within the ANC and the maintenance of a successful united front between the ANC and its allies . The longer the discussions with the government for agreement on a new constitution go on , the more difficult it will be to hold the movement together . There are mutterings of dissatisfaction within the lower echelons of the ANC that the leadership is not communicating effectively with the membership on the discussions with de Klerk . The Winnie Mandela trial has also caused controversy within the organization . It is not easy for the ANC to build up an effective organization after so many years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members at the present time . The hope was that there would be a million members one year after the ban was lifted . The government can take advantage of ANC difficulties to organize the coalition against it among disgruntled whites , Inkatha and elements within the Coloured and Indian communities that accept the racial divisions in the tri-cameral parliament to offset the popular following of the ANC . <p> One thing was very clear to me . Sanctions against South Africa should not be lifted until a clear agreement has been reached about the process for devising a new constitution . Too many things can happen at this stage to knock the process off course . International pressure may still be necessary to see that progress is made towards a democratic solution . What Hope for a Peaceful Transition to a Democratic State ? <p> I posed this question to many people with whom I talked . No one had a glib answer . The problems are too serious for that , but I received no cynical answers either . I liked what Nabs Weasels , the director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political prisoners and a hostel for family members who have come to visit prisoners ) said to me : " I have a guarded optimism because I want it so much . The alternative is too awful to contemplate . " <p> In spite of fears , a general spirit of expectancy prevails . Changes already occurring strengthen this spirit . As the showdown approaches between the government and the ANC and its allies , both sides try to exercise caution in their public statements . A lot of public attention is given to Joe Slovo , General Secretary of the South African Communist Party and a member of the national executive of the ANC . I met him in the national office of the ANC in Johannesburg . I also came across his trail in various places I was visiting , for he speaks widely across the country . He spoke to a thousand students at the University of Natal in Durban while I was there , sponsored by student organizations . His speeches are designed to quiet fears . The report in the Natal Witness was headed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The burden of his speech was that " here in South Africa supporting multipartyism means working very hard to develop a culture of tolerance for diverging political perspectives . It will not be easy , but it is essential that we build from this pile of ashes , a new political culture -- where robust debate , criticism and disagreement does not lead to political suppression . " <p> When I questioned ANC leaders , as well as government people , on how they could solve their fundamental differences on election of a Constituent Assembly , or on the form of government to be created , they responded they may have to compromise . This is what Walter Sisulu said , without defining the kind of compromise that would be acceptable . The left wing of the movement would surely protest any great deviation from the organization 's stated position . The same kind of answer came from Dr. Sandy Shaw , Director of Planning for the government 's Constitutional Development Service , when I met with him in Pretoria . <p> The ANC 's public statements on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites . The ANC Land Commission , for instance , issued a discussion document at the end of February saying that simple nationalization will not solve the unequal distribution of land . They recommended flexible forms of land ownership , including private , communal , cooperative , and state ownership . A document for internal ANC debate says nationalization " is not a simple , clear-cut issue " The paper said that while nationalization could ensure essential services , better working conditions and increased social expenditure , it could not give a new democratic government the means to provide jobs , houses , and education . <p> Hope for a peaceful transition to a democratic South Africa is strengthened by a general looking-ahead to the post-apartheid era . The Weekly Mail ( an anti-apartheid paper ) of March 1-7 , 1991 , ran a special section on " 30 rising stars who 'll shape tomorrow 's South Africa . " An introductory paragraph said , " One hopeful sign is clear amid the deep-seated problems as South Africa enters a period of transition . There is a rich diversity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new society " The list was impressive , including blacks , whites , church people , trade unionists , scholars , business people , and members of the ANC , the PAC , the Democratic Party , and the National Party . I was impressed by the fact that people with whom I talked , although they had suffered detention , torture , exile , and confiscation of land , did not dwell on grievances but talked of the task ahead . <p> There are a multiplicity of organizations as well as individuals making for a dynamic South African society . Even during the heyday of apartheid all kinds of opposition groups survived . And now they are thriving . There is a stimulating mix of organizations -- local , regional , and national -- with independent bases . This is essential in a democratic society . I must have been in the offices of 30 or more such groups quite beyond the essentially political organizations -- Black Sash , Transvaal Rural Action Committee , the Civic Association of Southern Transuaal , Legal Resources Centre , Pietermaritzburg Agency for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African Health Workers Congress , etc . They will not be stifled . <p> The problems will not go away in South Africa . They must be faced and dealt with by the people who are there . Most whites will not leave the country as the French did from Algeria , or the white Rhodesians from Zimbabwe . Furthermore , just as it is most unlikely that there will be a successful white right wing coup , it is also unlikely that there will be a mass black uprising to take over the government in revolutionary action . The peoples of South Africa have to face the problems of the future together . The probability is that there will be no " independence day " like Namibia 's or Zimbabwe 's . The celebration can be reserved for a new government under a new non-racial constitution . Although plenty of rough days lie ahead , the only secure future in South Africa is for blacks and whites to learn how to live together . <p> One thing is certain in my mind : if a new , democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turmoil of the past decades , it will be a historic miracle . For here is a country that experienced the European invasion , like the rest of Africa , but where the settlers stayed on because of a favorable climate and economy . They ruled a country of diverse people , languages and cultures . They exacerbated the divisions to strengthen their own domination even as the creation of an urban society tore down barriers and a unified opposition was born . Yet the fruits of the divisive policy still exist -- nine languages are spoken in South Africa . Twenty percent of the people do not speak either English or Afrikaans . The whites are divided into English and Afrikaans speaking , with the wounds of the Boer War still festering . The apartheid system that created the homelands not only tried to separate the Africans from one another , but also the Indians and the Coloureds . Not many societies have been so divided and so exploited for the benefit of the settlers . <p> And now this is breaking down . What a challenge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable , democratic whole .

@@4089241 IN BOX SPECIAL REPORT </p> CHINA IN 2011 </p> 1 : " China Is Communist in Name Only . " WRONG . If Vladimir Lenin were reincarnated in 21st-century Beijing and managed to avert his eyes from the city 's glittering skyscrapers and conspicuous consumption , he would instantly recognize in the ruling Chinese Communist Party a replica of the system he designed nearly a century ago for the victors of the Bolshevik Revolution . One need only look at the party 's structure to see how communist -- and Leninist -- China 's political system remains . Sure , China long ago dumped the core of the communist economic system , replacing rigid central planning with commercially minded state enterprises that coexist with a vigorous private sector . Yet for all their liberalization of the economy , Chinese leaders have been careful to keep control of the commanding heights of politics through the party 's grip on the " three Ps " : personnel , propaganda , and the People 's Liberation Army . </p> The PLA is the party 's military , not the country 's . Unlike in the West , where controversies often arise about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party is on constant guard for the opposite phenomenon , the depoliticization of the military . Their fear is straightforward : the loss of party control over the generals and their troops . In 1989 , one senior general refused to march his soldiers into Beijing to clear students out of Tiananmen Square , an incident now seared into the ruling class 's collective memory . After all , the army 's crackdown on the demonstrations preserved the party 's hold on power in 1989 , and its leaders have since worked hard to keep the generals on their side , should they be needed to put down protests again . </p> As in the Soviet Union , the party controls the media through its Propaganda Department , which issues daily directives , both formally on paper and in emails and text messages , and informally over the phone , to the media . The directives set out , often in detail , how news considered sensitive by the party -- such as the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo -- should be handled or whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the party dictates all senior personnel appointments in ministries and companies , universities and the media , through a shadowy and little-known body called the Organization Department . Through the department , the party oversees just about every significant position in every field in the country . Clearly , the Chinese remember Stalin 's dictate that the cadres decide everything . </p> Indeed , if you benchmark the Chinese Communist Party against a definitional checklist authored by Robert Service , the veteran historian of the Soviet Union , the similarities are remarkable . As with communism in its heyday elsewhere , the party in China has eradicated or emasculated political rivals , eliminated the autonomy of the courts and media , restricted religion and civil society , denigrated rival versions of nationhood , centralized political power , established extensive networks of security police , and dispatched dissidents to labor camps . There is a good reason why the Chinese system is often described as " market-Leninism . " </p> 2 : " The Party Controls All Aspects of Life in China . " NOT ANYMORE . No question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1949 until his death in 1976 . In those bad old days , ordinary workers had to ask their supervisors ' permission not only to get married , but to move in with their spouses . Even the precise timing for starting a family relied on a nod from on high . </p> Since then , the Chinese Communist Party has recognized that such intensive interference in people 's personal lives is a liability in building a modern economy . Under the reforms kick-started by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s , the party has gradually removed itself from the private lives of all but the most recalcitrant of dissidents . The waning in the 1980s and 1990s of the old cradle-to-grave system of state workplaces , health care , and other social services also dismantled an intricate system of controls centered on neighborhood committees , which among other purposes were used for snooping on ordinary citizens . </p> The party has benefited hugely from this shift , even if many young people these days have little knowledge of what the party does and consider it irrelevant to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not encouraged to take an interest in the party 's internal operations , anyway . Powerful party organs like the Organization and Propaganda Departments do not have signs outside their offices . They have no listed phone numbers . Their low profile has been strategically smart , keeping their day-to-day doings out of public view while allowing the party to take full credit for the country 's rapid economic growth . This is how China 's grand bargain works : The party allows citizens great leeway to improve their lives , as long as they keep out of politics . </p> 3 : " The Internet Will Topple the Party . " NOPE . Bill Clinton famously remarked a decade ago that the efforts of Chinese leaders to control the Internet were doomed , akin to " nailing Jello to a wall . " It turns out the former president was right , but not in the way he thought . Far from being a conveyor belt for Western democratic values , the Internet in China has largely done the opposite . The " Great Firewall " works well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind the firewall , however , hypernationalist netizens have a much freer hand . </p> The Chinese Communist Party has always draped itself in the cloak of nationalism to secure popular support and played up the powerful narrative of China 's historical humiliation by the West . Even run-of-the-mill foreign-investment proposals are sometimes compared to the " Eight Allied Armies " that invaded and occupied Beijing in 1900 . But when such views bubble up on the Internet , the government often skillfully manages to channel them to its own ends , as when Beijing used an online outburst of anti-Japanese sentiment to pressure Tokyo after a Chinese fishing-boat captain was arrested in Japanese waters . Such bullying tactics may not help China 's image abroad , but they have reinforced support at home for the party , which the state media is keen to portray as standing up to foreign powers . </p> Through its Propaganda Department , the party uses a variety of often creative tactics to ensure that its voice dominates the web . Not only does each locality have its own specially trained Internet police to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also overseen a system for granting small cash payments to netizens who post pro-government comments on Internet bulletin boards and discussion groups . Moreover , the dominant national Internet portals know that their profitable business models depend on keeping subversive content off their sites . If they consistently flout the rules , they can simply be shut down . </p> 4 : " Other Countries Want to Follow the China Model . " GOOD LUCK . Of course , many developing countries are envious of China 's rise . Which poor country would n't want three decades of 10 percent annual growth ? And which despot would n't want 10 percent growth and an assurance that he or she would meanwhile stay in power for the long haul ? China undoubtedly has important lessons to teach other countries about how to manage development , from fine-tuning reforms by testing them in different parts of the country to managing urbanization so that large cities are not overrun by slums and shantytowns . </p> Moreover , China has done this while consciously flouting advice from the West , using the market without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foreign bankers trekked to Beijing to sell the gospel of financial liberalization , telling Chinese officials to float their currency and open their capital account . Who could blame China 's leaders for detecting the evident self-interest in such advice and rejecting it ? China 's success has given rise to the fashionable notion of a new " Beijing Consensus " that eschews the imposition of free markets and democracy that were hallmarks of the older " Washington Consensus . " In its place , the Beijing Consensus supposedly offers pragmatic economics and made-to-order authoritarian politics . </p> But look closer at the China model , and it is clear that it is not so easily replicated . Most developing countries do not have China 's bureaucratic depth and tradition , nor do they have the ability to mobilize resources and control personnel in the way that China 's party structure allows . Could the Democratic Republic of the Congo ever establish and manage an Organization Department ? China 's authoritarianism works because it has the party 's resources to back it up . </p> 5 : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or at least for the foreseeable future . Unlike in Taiwan and South Korea , China 's middle class has not emerged with any clear demand for Western-style democracy . There are some obvious reasons why . All three of China 's close Asian neighbors , including Japan , became democracies at different times and in different circumstances . But all were effectively U.S. protectorates , and Washington was crucial in forcing through democratic change or institutionalizing it . South Korea 's decision to announce elections ahead of the 1988 Seoul Olympics , for example , was made under direct U.S. pressure . Japan and South Korea are also smaller and more homogeneous societies , lacking the vast continental reach of China and its multitude of clashing nationalities and ethnic groups . And needless to say , none underwent a communist revolution whose founding principle was driving foreign imperialists out of the country . </p> China 's urban middle class may wish for more political freedom , but it has n't dared rise up en masse against the state because it has so much to lose . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of economic reforms , even as it has clamped down hard on dissent . The freedom to consume -- be it in the form of cars , real estate , or well-stocked supermarkets -- is much more attractive than vague notions of democracy , especially when individuals pushing for political reform could lose their livelihoods and even their freedom . The cost of opposing the party is prohibitively high . Hence the hotbeds of unrest in recent years have mostly been rural areas , where China 's poorest , who are least invested in the country 's economic miracle , reside . " Workers of the world unite ! You have nothing to lose except your mortgages " does n't quite cut it as a revolutionary slogan . </p> All this is why some analysts see splits within the party as a more likely vehicle for political change . Like any large political organization , the Chinese Communist Party is factionalized along multiple lines , ranging from local fiefdoms ( exemplified on the national stage by the " Shanghai Gang " under former President Jiang Zemin ) to internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist Youth League through Jiang 's successor Hu Jintao ) . There are also clear policy disputes over everything from the proper pace of political liberalization to the extent of the private sector 's role in the economy . </p> But highlighting these differences can obscure the larger reality . Since 1989 , when the party split at the top and almost came asunder , the cardinal rule has been no public divisions in the Politburo . Today , top-level cooperation is as much the norm as debilitating factional competition . Xi Jinping , the heir apparent , is set to take over at the next party congress in 2012 . Assuming his likely deputy , Li Keqiang , follows with the usual five-year term , China 's top leadership seems set until 2022 . For the Chinese , the United States looks increasingly like a banana republic by comparison . </p> The idea that China would one day become a democracy was always a Western notion , born of our theories about how political systems evolve . Yet all evidence so far suggests these theories are wrong . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China to be a Western democracy -- and it seems to have all the tools it needs to ensure that it does n't become one . </p> Richard McGregor , former Beijing bureau chief of the Financial Times , is author of The Party : The Secret World of China 's Communist Rulers . </p> By RICHARD MCGREGOR </p>

Technology heightens the learning experience by providing an opportunity for active student participation in understanding and interpreting the environment ( Thompson et al . 1992 ) . <p> Using an educator 's perspective , this paper compares two computer audit software packages available on the market - Audit Command Language ( ACL ) and Interactive Data Extraction and Analysis ( IDEA ) .

This section also provides student feedback , pedagogical suggestions , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer keys , and other resources . The paper concludes with an overall evaluation of ACL and IDEA . II . WHY USE AUDIT SOFTWARE ? <p> Given that the accounting curriculum seems to expand endlessly , why would an instructor consider adding an audit software package to his or her course ? Teaching students the " tools of the trade " makes them more aware of current practice and therefore more marketable . Accounting students typically get exposure to other technological tools of the trade such as spreadsheets , accounting packages , database software , and online research resources ( Bain et al . 2002 ) . Incorporating audit software into the curriculum helps complete this toolkit and prepares students for the content of the computer-based Uniform CPA exam . Moreover , using audit software can help students develop high-order cognitive skills because it encourages them to actively participate in applying theory to real-life situations . Audit software activities become more relevant , allowing students to gain a better understanding of the software and studied environment ( Hakeem 2001 ; Thompson et al . 1992 ) . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Accounting Profession <p> Professional organizations have developed professional standards and guidance to help auditors evaluate electronic evidence and advance toward continuous auditing . In 1998 , the Information Systems Audit and Control Association ( ISACA ) established an audit guideline specifically addressing the use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques or CAATs ( ISACA 1998 ) . In 1999 , the AICPA and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ( CICA ) published a joint research report identifying six preconditions necessary for continuous auditing , including auditor proficiency in information technology ( IT ) and the system ( CICA 1999 ) . In 2001 , the AICPA issued SAS No. 94 to warn auditors that a substantive-only audit approach may not be feasible in complex IT environments ( AICPA 2001 ) . <p> The AICPA recognizes the role that IT plays in educating future accountants , stating , " All professional accountants , irrespective of their primary work domain or role , must acquire both relevant theoretical knowledge and practical IT skills " ( AICPA 1996 , para . 12 ) . Incorporating technology such as generalized audit software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit practices ( Nieschwietz et al . 2002 ) that can be used for any audit requiring data extraction and analysis . Accounting firms and internal auditing functions are increasingly utilizing GAS because of its user-friendly interfaces and its ability to quickly examine 100 percent of a population ( Lanza 1998 ; Sayana 2003 ) . GAS efficiently performs many manual procedures , allowing auditors to focus on understanding clients ' businesses and creating more value for the client ( Lanza 1998 ) . <p> Larger firms initially used internally developed GAS programs that required specialized programming knowledge . As the storage and processing capabilities of PCs have increased , firms have generally abandoned the proprietary GAS programs in favor of commercial GAS programs , which do not require any programming knowledge ( Warner 1998 ) . GAS is used by hundreds of organizations across the world , including all Big 4 accounting firms , hundreds of governmental agencies , and almost all of the Fortune 100 firms ( ACL Services Ltd 2004 ) . Moreover , almost 50 percent of internal auditors report using GAS in their operations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAS in practice , together with its user-friendly interface , makes it a serious candidate for inclusion in courses such as accounting information systems , auditing , and information systems auditing . Audit Software as a Learning Mechanism <p> Horsfield ( 1995 ) suggests that auditing students should understand the following three areas : audit theory , the relationship between audit theory and audit practice , and current audit techniques . Unfortunately , traditional audit classes do not provide students with concrete experience ( Siegel et al . 1997 ) . Incorporating audit software into the audit curriculum can reinforce students ' understanding of audit concepts ( Nieschwietz et al . 2002 ) . In terms of Bloom 's ( 1956 ) taxonomy , instructors can use audit software as a learning mechanism to move students from knowledge and comprehension of audit concepts to application of those concepts , and with well-designed instructional cases , perhaps to analysis , synthesis , and evaluation of audit problems . Specifically , using audit software in conjunction with comprehensive audit cases can develop strategic and critical thinking skills ( Gelinas et al . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " link data , knowledge , and insight to provide quality advice for strategic decision making " ( AICPA 1999 , 17 ) . <p> Bryant and Hunton ( 2000 ) note that research addressing educational technology in the accounting discipline is not as well developed as in the pure educational research realm . The most recent accounting research into education technology is descriptive rather than empirical and focuses on distance learning and hypermedia ( Bryant and Hunton 2000 ) . Thus , research has not empirically shown the value of incorporating audit software into the accounting curriculum . In the last two years , accounting education journals have included a small number of instructional cases using audit software ( e.g. , Gelinas et al . 2001 ; Nieschwietz et al . 2002 ) . Gelinas et al . ( 2001 ) report that their students agree or strongly agree that using the audit software supplemented their understanding of risk and audit procedures ( 72 percent ) and helped them understand the use of technology in auditing ( 91 percent ) .

OVERVIEW AND COMPARISON OF ACL AND IDEA <p> ACL and IDEA are the most common commercial GAS packages ( McCollum and Salierno 2003 ) . Both external and internal auditors use these packages for data extraction , data analysis , and fraud detection/prevention . This section presents comparisons of functional and pedagogical features of ACL and IDEA . Training Manuals <p> Both products offer self-guided training manuals : ACL for Windows 7.0 Workbook ( ACL Services , Ltd. 2002 ; hereafter ACL Workbook ) and IDEA 2002 Workbook ( Audimation Services , Inc. 2002 ; hereafter IDEA Workbook ) . The training manuals include data sets , click-by-click instructions , and screen shots of command results . However , the training manuals are not educational textbooks ; thus they do not include certain pedagogical features such as discussion questions , additional exercises/problems , or conceptual material . The ACL Workbook is over 400 pages long and is organized by audit task . Users proceed through a series of lessons organized into nine modules . Each lesson covers a type of task that an auditor might perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The first five modules cover the basic functionality of ACL , while the last four modules cover more advanced functions ( see Table 1 ) . The IDEA Workbook is over 250 pages long and is organized by audit area . Users proceed through five sections , with the middle three sections devoted to accounts receivable , accounts payable , and inventory , respectively ( see Table 2 ) . Functionality <p> Both ACL and IDEA provide a broad spectrum of data analysis and extraction functions . Users can easily sort , summarize , stratify , age , and calculate data statistics . Users can extract records by setting data filters . Both software packages also permit the selection and evaluation of samples using a number of methods . Users can examine files for duplicates , gaps , and proper sequences . The packages allow the comparison of multiple files , creation of new files , customization of reports , and documentation of audit tasks in several different ways . Users can also save commands in batches for repeated use . Table 3 compares ACL and IDEA software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive in their functionality . Fraud Detection <p> McCollum and Salierno ( 2003 ) report that 51 percent of internal auditors surveyed use software , including ACL and IDEA , to detect fraud. 1 The IDEA Workbook devotes an entire chapter to using IDEA to detect fraud , making it easy to incorporate fraud into the curriculum . Section 3 of the IDEA Workbook has students complete an audit and fraud investigation for accounts payable . The IDEA Workbook explains how fraud is committed in accounts payable , outlines needed audit tests , and then requires students to complete a series of exercises designed to uncover fraud . Though the ACL Workbook provides only limited reference to using ACL for fraud detection , ACL and IDEA both provide similar fraud detection capabilities . Examples of tasks that can be applied in a fraud detection context include stratifications , extractions , duplicate key detections , joining of databases , and application of Benford 's Law . Pedagogical Logistics <p> Instructors obtain the ACL Workbook by joining the ACL Education Partners Program. 2 A demo version of ACL 7.0 accompanies the Workbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 Students purchase the ACL Workbook and software either directly from ACL ( list $50 ) or via the bookstore ( volume discounts may be available ) . <p> Students must purchase the IDEA Workbook either from the instructor or via the bookstore ( $25 student price before bookstore markup ; retail $200 ) . Beginning in 2003 , the IDEA Workbook includes the training version of the software . Audimation provides the software to instructors through the Education Donation Program , which allows free installation of software and data files on campus lab stations. 4 , 5 Table 4 presents a comparison of the two packages ' logistics for educational purposes . IV . EXAMPLES OF CLASSROOM APPLICATIONS <p> This section illustrates how one may incorporate audit software into an accounting course . Recognizing that each course at each institution is unique , we briefly discuss how instructors at various universities are using the software packages . Hopefully these illustrations , coupled with a resource web page , will make it easier for the reader to incorporate the use of audit software in an appropriate course . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is teaching the basic features of the software . Completing these manuals in an academic course provides hands-on knowledge of how audit software looks , feels , and works . However , to have an enhanced learning experience , the student should apply this hands-on knowledge in completing additional tasks . The next section briefly describes how each author incorporates audit software into her course , discusses student feedback , and discloses how other universities are using audit software in accounting courses . We refer to a variety of course materials available online at http : **38;4388;TOOLONG . Some materials , like exam questions and answers , are password protected with user name = sobajis and password = jis . To help the reader , we identify the resources available on the web page with the following parenthetical notation : ( ACL or IDEA Resource 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) . The numbers correspond to the table of contents for the web page , which is reproduced in Table 5 . We will continue to update this web page with ( 1 ) additional materials submitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ACL change their software and corresponding training materials . Using ACL in the Classroom Illustration <p> ACL is used in a graduate-level , elective IS Auditing course at the University of Montana , a medium-sized ( 13,000 students ) public university . Undergraduate auditing is a prerequisite for this class . The ACL portion of the course spans five weeks , accounts for approximately 43 percent of the course points , and requires successful completion of two large ACL assignments ( eight training exercises and six application exercises ) ( ACL Resource 2 ) and an exam ( ACL Resource 5 ) . During this portion of the course , the class meets in a computer lab for approximately ten hours . <p> During the labs , students proceed at their own pace through the first five modules of the ACL Workbook , submitting various printouts from the practice exercises ( ACL Resource 2 ) for grading . Students complete these five training modules in 10 to 15 hours . At the beginning of the lab sessions , the instructor presents mini-lectures using slides ( ACL Resource 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize the important features of ACL . This is an opportunity to compare and contrast the various ACL commands . <p> In addition , the instructor leads the class in completing ungraded exercises ( ACL Resource 2 ) that provide additional practice with ACL . This is an opportunity for students to apply the mechanics of ACL while observing how the same task can be accomplished a number of ways . For example , there are at least three ways students can obtain a count and dollar amount of positive , negative , and zero balance items in a file . Doing this together in the lab allows students who approached it inefficiently to learn from students doing it more efficiently . More importantly , this provides an opportunity for the instructor to verbally introduce audit objectives that may be associated with each ACL task ( recall that the ACL Workbook is organized by task and not audit objective ) . Using the prior example , counting and obtaining positive , negative , and zero balances in an accounts receivable master file highlights credit balances that may need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts payable master file , it would highlight potential understatements ( zero balances ) as well as unusual balances . <p> After completing the first five ACL Workbook modules , students complete a series of graded exercises . These " application " exercises ( ACL Resource 2 ) require students to use the ACL Workbook data to apply what they have learned . In conjunction with completing many of these data manipulation and analysis tasks , students must note why the procedure might be performed in an audit , making the link between the ACL task and the management assertion that it examines . At the end of the semester , students complete an exam testing their ACL knowledge ( ACL Resource 5 ) . Student Feedback <p> Feedback on the ACL application in the course was provided in two formats in the last two administrations of the course , a survey specifically addressing the ACL project and the standard course evaluation form . Seventy-seven percent of students ( n = 35 ) agreed or strongly agreed that ACL helped them to understand what audit tests might be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them understand why audit tests might be done . Nearly all agreed or strongly agreed that ACL contributed to their learning experience ( 94 percent ) and they wanted to spend more time using ACL in this or other classes ( 86 percent ) . Feedback in comment form was uniformly positive , with no negative comments about ACL appearing on either the survey or course evaluations . The most consistent comment was that they benefited from the " hands-on " nature of using ACL , with some students specifically noting that it helped them apply what they had learned in this course and other courses . Using IDEA in the Classroom Illustration <p> IDEA was used in a senior-level , required Information Systems and Control course at Texas Christian University , a medium-sized ( 8,000 students ) private university . The IDEA portion of the course spans approximately three weeks and accounts for 13 percent of the course points earned by completing IDEA assignments ( IDEA Resource 2 ) and answering IDEA-related questions on an exam ( IDEA Resource 5 ) . During this portion of the course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students in this course have not yet completed an auditing course , so the IDEA project is preceded by one and one-half weeks of introduction to basic auditing concepts and CAATs . <p> Students proceed at their own pace through the first four sections of the IDEA Workbook . While the IDEA Workbook directs students to print out many screen prints/reports , the instructor designates a specific subset for them to submit for grading as part of the assignment . This assignment also requires students to answer questions based on the results of tasks completed in the IDEA Workbook . Students complete the first four sections and related questions in approximately seven hours . Each section first outlines potential audit tasks for designated audit objectives and provides a short audit program for the particular audit area . Because the IDEA Workbook is organized by audit area , most tasks are duplicated across the sections . Similar to the approach with ACL , the instructor reviews the important features of IDEA and focuses on how IDEA can be used to achieve audit objectives , using both in-class discussions and lectures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feedback on IDEA was obtained in the same manner as the feedback for ACL . Two-thirds of the students in the class ( n = 64 ) agreed or strongly agreed that IDEA contributed to the learning experience by helping them to both understand what audit tests might be done and why audit tests might be done . Fifty-seven percent of the students agreed that they wanted to spend more time using IDEA in this class or other classes . While the ratings did show large variation among students , responses were generally at the midpoint and more favorable end of the scale . <p> Examining student comments provides insights into successfully incorporating an audit software package into the class . Students liked the opportunity to use an audit software package that is used in industry . Given that the students had not previously taken auditing , using the software helped them relate to the overview of auditing included in this course . However , the timing of the project ( end of the semester ) was problematic . Students wanted more time to use the software . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in time . ) Also , several students commented on the inability to use the software outside the labs . Moreover , due to university restrictions , only one in-class lab was possible . More in-class labs would allow additional guidance to reduce the out-of-class completion times . Allowing students to complete exercises on their own computers would also increase students ' access to the software . In addition , the IDEA project was completed after manual and computerized accounting practice sets . This may have affected students ' perceptions of the IDEA project. 6 Suggestions for Instructors <p> While students are completing the ACL Workbook modules or IDEA Workbook sections , their focus is on the mechanics of the software . Because the ACL Workbook is not organized by audit area , the instructor should supplement the ACL Workbook with information on how the tasks can be associated with audit objectives in various audit areas . As noted above , the instructor can accomplish this verbally as students are learning the software mechanics or through mini-lectures . Regardless of the package chosen , the instructor should repeatedly ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software . For example , why would an auditor look for gaps or duplicates in numbering sequences ? Why would an auditor stratify items in a file ? Why would an auditor join a payroll file and an employee master file ? The extent to which instructors need to link software tasks with audit objectives and management assertions depends on the recency of students ' audit training , if any , prior to using the software . <p> Both ACL and IDEA have the ability to sample . The IDEA Workbook , however , covers only random record sampling . On the other hand , the A CL Workbook has a much more extensive coverage of sampling . While auditing classes may expose some students to sampling , often they do not calculate , select , and evaluate samples using statistical methods ( e.g. , MUS ) . When using statistical commands in ACL , the instructor should emphasize understanding statistical terminology , knowing which statistical applications are appropriate for which audit objectives , and interpreting ACL evaluation reports . Sampling is one of the more advanced applications of audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab time is key to the success of using either package . Students using ACL or IDEA are both learning a new software package ( e.g. , interface , commands ) and learning how to relate the commands to audit objectives . Support from both the instructor and other students in a classroom lab environment can greatly facilitate these learning processes . <p> Both the ACL Workbook and IDEA Workbook contain a number of minor errors or items needing clarification , which the instructors corrected via errata sheets ( ACL Resource 4 , IDEA Resource 4 ) . Most students have sufficient computer intuition to easily handle these corrections. 7 How Other Universities Use ACL and IDEA <p> Given the lack of instructional materials that accompany the software and the scarcity of a wide variety of cases published in academic journals , we solicited additional input from other instructors using ACL and IDEA . Using contacts obtained from ACL and Audimation ( the U.S. distributor of IDEA ) , as well as personal contacts , we emailed instructors regarding how they were currently using the software . Eight of 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IDEA users ( 38 percent ) responded to the qualitative survey. 8 Table 6 summarizes the qualitative responses , while the quantitative responses are discussed below . <p> Respondents use ACL ( IDEA ) more often in graduate ( undergraduate ) courses . The courses in which both ACL and IDEA are most often used are audit-related and both packages consume an average 14 percent ( 13 percent ) of the course schedule . Most respondents use the respective Workbook , but more ACL users have developed their own materials and datasets . The average time respondents had been using the software was 2.8 and 2.7 years for ACL and IDEA , respectively . <p> When asked why they selected the particular software package , the reason ACL users indicated most often ( 50 percent ) was that the package was an industry leader and widely used . IDEA users also cited this reason ( 27 percent ) , as well as free software ( 27 percent ) , ease of use ( 18 percent ) , and exposure to IDEA at a conference ( 18 percent ) as common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few respondents ( 13 percent for IDEA and 22 percent for ACL ) had technical problems with the software installation. 9 Table 6 describes the technical problems encountered . <p> Some respondents also provided the materials they used in their courses and course syllabi . We categorized syllabi resources by type of software , level of course , and focus of course and posted them on the ACL/IDEA resource web page ( ACL Resource 6 , IDEA Resource 6 ) . One respondent suggested a no-cost way of using IDEA . First , to learn the software features , students complete the Audimation " Getting Started Guide , " which instructors can copy . Next , students complete the Audimation Case study 2001 materials , which instructors can copy . Finally , students complete supplemental exercises provided by Nieschwietz et al . ( 2002 ) . Additional Methods for Implementing GAS in the Classroom <p> While a growing number of internal auditors are using ACL or IDEA to analyze audit data , over 50 percent still use Excelr or Accessr ( McCollum and Salierno 2003 ) . 10 Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Access to implement GAS and the associated concepts in the classroom . Several resources have been developed for Excel and Access . For example , Borthick et al . ( 2001 ) provide a case where students develop basic queries for an Access database containing automobile customers , makers , and dealer information . Assignment files and multiple choice questions are available on our accompanying website ( General Resource 1 ) . A second excellent resource is Computer-Assisted Auditing with Great Plains Dynamics ( Lehman 2003 ) . This workbook provides 15 step-by-step exercises that require students to , first , export selected data from Great Plains Dynamics , and to then , analyze them using Wordr , Excel , or Access . V. CONCLUSION <p> This paper is a case study of the use of two audit software packages in educational settings . Our goals are to provide examples as to how audit software might be included in courses , and , to provide insight into whether ACL , IDEA , or some other application would best suit students ' needs . Incorporating audit software into appropriate accounting courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and IDEA are both fully functional audit software packages that are easy to use . The primary differences between the educational versions of these packages are that the IDEA Workbook is organized around audit area and is shorter . Due to the organization of the IDEA Workbook and ease of use , IDEA may be better suited for undergraduate courses ; however , instructors may find less success with IDEA ( or any other GAS package ) in undergraduate courses crowded with other projects . <p> While both ACL and IDEA have education adopter programs that provide free software , they both lack additional educational materials . Two comprehensive cases have recently been published that include additional datasets : Gelinas et al . ( 2001 ) using ACL and Nieschwietz et al . ( 2002 ) using IDEA . This paper briefly describes how we use ACL and IDEA , including student feedback . More importantly , we have assembled numerous resources for educational adopters of ACL and IDEA on a resource web page , which we will continue to update with new information . <p> Finally , instructors must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . Its effectiveness depends on many factors , including time spent on the project , the students ' knowledge of auditing prior to the project , available in-class lab time , and the number of other projects students complete in the course . In addition , the nature of audit software assignments can range from training tasks to integrated cases . We hope the availability of these resources , coupled with our descriptions of the easy to use packages , will assist others in selecting appropriate audit software package for classroom use . <p> We gratefully acknowledge the feedback received from the associate editor , two anonymous reviewers , and participants at the 2002 AIS Educator 's Conference . Of the internal auditors using software to detect fraud , 47 percent use ACL and 6 percent use IDEA ( McCollum and Salierno 2003 ) . ACL made changes to its Education Partners Program in early 2004 . These changes are briefly described in the Appendix . Information on this program is detailed at http : **35;4428;TOOLONG . This site also contains links to material for anyone to download for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases detailing ACL in practice ) . Instructors should specifically request the ACL Workbook for 7.0 when joining the program , as this is no longer part of the program 's standard package . Instructors may also want to acquire the book CAATTs and Other Beasts for Auditors ( Coderre 2001a ) . For ACL materials on fraud , instructors may also want to acquire the Fraud Toolkit for ACL by Coderre ( 2001b ) . This book uses ACL batch code to perform eight categories of fraud detection tests , including completeness and integrity , cross-tabulation , duplicates , gaps , data profile , ratio analysis , and Benford 's Law analysis . One author installed ACL on individual lab machines and encountered no technical difficulties . Instructors wishing to install ACL to utilize network capabilities ( e.g. , file sharing ) should contact ACL for further information . One author installed IDEA on individual lab machines and encountered no technical difficulties . Instructors wishing to install IDEA to utilize network capabilities should contact IDEA for further information . Instructors making requests through the Education Donation Program also receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyright release for classroom use . The case study is also available for free download on the IDEA website . This conjecture is supported by written comments comparing the IDEA project to other course projects developed specifically for educational use . The instructor should be aware that copies of the ACL Workbook obtained at different times might have slight differences , most notably margin changes or minor corrections that , in turn , change page numbers . Page numbers in the 2002 book were one to three pages different compared to the 2001 book ( same title and version of ACL ) , a fact that was impossible to discover until the course began . This necessitated last minute corrections to all assignment sheets , instructor notes , and errata notes that referred to page numbers . Numbers of users surveyed does not reflect the number of instructors actually using the software . Neither ACL nor Audimation could provide a list of active users ; they could only provide a list of those participating in their educational programs . This survey was conducted prior to IDEA including the software in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged for students to legally use the software at home or used software accompanying a textbook . Currently , approximately 40 percent of internal auditors use ACL or IDEA for data extraction and analysis ( McCollum and Salierno 2003 ) .

@@4017141 ABSTRACT : Environmental participation was examined within the context of a nonformal , field program for two small groups of high school students . A model of positive environmental action was developed and revised . An examination of the model reveals that positive environmental action can not be explained easily by a focus on predictors of individual behaviors nor the manipulation of these behaviors . The results indicate that the relationships between learning and environmental action are interactive , dynamic , and greatly influenced by the participants and the social situations within which they operate . <p> In 1977 , the Tbilisi conference on environmental education outlined the objective that environmental education should provide social groups and individuals with an opportunity to be actively involved at all levels working toward the resolution of environmental problems ( UNESCO , 1980 , p. 71 ) . The World Commission on Environment and Development ( WCED , 1987 ) and the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro also reiterated that citizens must take a participatory role in environmental protection . <p> Many researchers and practitioners in environmental education have taken environmental participation goals quite seriously . Fien ( 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should promote participation in a variety of forms of social action to help improve and maintain environmental quality . As such , environmental participation is expected to play a role in social transformation . Others have interpreted participation to mean that people should practice environmentally responsible behaviors , and that achieving such behaviors is the ultimate goal of environmental education ( Hines , Hungerford , &; Tomera , 1986-1987 ; Hungerford &; yolk , 1990 ; Ramsey , 1993 ) . <p> Inspired in particular by the idea of environmental participation , I developed , implemented , and evaluated a nonformal environmental education program at the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize , Central America . In this article , I show how a practical environmental education experience informed the development and revision of a theoretical model of positive environmental action . During this process , some of my underlying assumptions were challenged , and the study became a critical reflection on methodology in action . I became aware that the relationships between learning in environmental education and positive environmental action can not be explained easily by a focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those behaviors . Instead , these relationships are interactive , dynamic , and greatly influenced by the participants and the social situations within which they operate . <p> Research related to environmental action and behavior has increased . Models by Hines et al . ( 1986-1987 ) and Hungerford and yolk ( 1990 ) show how a behavioral manipulation of many variables can result in people 's participation in desirable environmental behaviors . These works went beyond earlier explorations in environmental action and behavior ( Borden &; Schettino , 1979 ; Ramsey &; Rickson , 1976 ) and have helped guide innovations in environmental education practice , particularly in formal schooling situations ( Ramsey , 1993 ; Ramsey &; Hungerford , 1989 ; yolk , 1993 ) . A Model of Positive Environmental Action <p> Although previous models and related research provide important background information , their usefulness was limited in the context of this study . I developed a new model of positive environmental action ( Figure 1 ) whose three main features distinguish it from earlier models . First , it emphasizes positive environmental action instead of environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the integration of multiple student-learning areas ( environmental concepts , environmental attitudes and sensitivity , action skills and procedures , and empowerment and ownership ) and their combined effect on positive environmental action . Finally , the model focuses on environmental education in a nonformal , experiential setting . An Emphasis on Action <p> In its emphasis on participation , this model is similar to earlier models . However , in this model , the participation goal is more narrowly defined as action , whereas most earlier models focus on behavior , such as responsible environmental behavior ( Hines et al. , 1986-1987 ; Sia , Hungerford , &; Tomera , 1985-1986 ) , or responsible citizenship behavior ( Hungerford &; yolk , 1990 ) . Positive environmental action is a deliberate strategy that involves decisions , planning , implementation , and reflection by an individual or a group . The action is also intended to achieve a specific positive environmental outcome , either small or large ( Emmons , 1994 ) . Defined as such , action has an intentional quality that may or may not characterize behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide insight on the distinction between action and behavior . Deci described the following three types of behavioral response : ( a ) non-self-determining , such as coercion ; ( b ) automatized or automatic , such as habit ; or ( c ) self-determined and involving the human capacity for deciding how to behave ( 1980 , p. 17 ) . Behavior is a much broader concept than action in that it might be voluntary or involuntary , automatic or nonautomatic . Moreover , behavior includes basic , individual responses that may or may not be deliberate efforts toward a certain goal . <p> Environmental behavior as described in the literature may fall under either Deci 's second or third category of behavioral response , but is often presented as a final product , not a combination of product and process . For example , pupils may place recyclable materials in an appropriate container because they have formed habits or want to avoid reprimands , not because personal knowledge and attitudes have helped lead them to a process of planning and action . Thus , their use of classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come about as a result of cognitive and affective processes , as well as the use of action skills and strategies . Either way , the result is the same . The environmental behavior is achieved , but perhaps not in the way environmental educators intended . <p> Positive environmental action can be classified only under Deci 's third type of behavioral response ( self-determined ) , given that it requires foresight and planning and is designed to serve a specific purpose based on the individual 's decisions . This kind of action is voluntary and nonautomatic and is both a process and a product . In the case of classroom recycling , if students themselves decide to start a recycling program , they may do so in response to their knowledge and attitudes about recycling issues and are able to understand and implement appropriate strategies . They become engaged in the process of action ( deciding , planning , implementing , and evaluating ) , aimed at a particular product ( reduction of solid waste , reusing resources ) . Integrated Learning Goals <p> Prior research has tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shore , 1975 ; Axelrod &; Lehman , 1993 ; Borden &; Schettino , 1979 ; Hines et al. , 1986-1987 ; Hungerford &; Volk , 1990 ; Jordan , Hungerford , &; Tomera , 1986 ; Marcinkowski , 1989 ; Ramsey , 1989 , 1993 ; Ramsey &; Rickson , 1976 ; Sia et al. , 1985-1986 ; Sivek , 1989 ) . Although I used other research initially in identifying important learning areas in environmental education , I found that the model of positive environmental action treats the areas not only as predictors or variables of environmental action , but also as important environmental education learning areas in and of themselves . Some earlier models present various cognitive and affective aspects in apparent isolation from one another . Others seem to regard the effects as sequential , additive , or even hierarchical . The new model is different in that it explicitly illustrates an integration of the learning areas and does not suggest a timeline for the occurrence of the various effects . The model shows four general learning areas : environmental concepts , environmental attitudes and sensitivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although each is referred to as a different learning area , their boundaries are not necessarily well defined . <p> There has been much discussion about the integrated nature of cognitive and affective learning . According to some , cognitive and affective learning are interactive and reciprocal ( Bloom , 1978 ; Brown , 1971 ; Stancato &; Hamacheck , 1990 ; Zimiles , 981 ) . There is a suggestion within this literature that educational programs that deal with the interactions of cognitive and affective learning are more productive than programs that emphasize one or the other . As Brown 11971 ) pointed out , it is difficult to make learning challenging and exciting when " a teacher 's methods and curriculum are bounded by limits that ignore the student as a feeling-thinking human being " ( p. 5 ) . When considering the goal of environmental participation , educators should treat students as feeling-thinking-acting human beings . Robottom and Hart ( 1995 ) also wrote that when environmental education concentrates primarily on a manipulation of behavior , the development of critical thinking in students is diminished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental action guides the development of an educational program in a nonformal , field setting . Students have intensive and direct experiences in the natural environment over several days . Some have suggested that environmental sensitivity can be built best through positive contact with the natural environment ( Hungerford &; yolk , 1990 ; McKnight , 1990 ; Peters-Grant , 1986 ) and that positive attitudes about various elements of the natural world can be increased through direct contact with them ( Harvey , 1989-1990 ; Newhouse , 1991 ) . <p> I designed the experiential element to help overcome some of the shortcomings that were identified in some school-based environmental education programs . For example , Pomerantz ( 1990-1991 ) found that environmental education materials used in schools tend to concentrate only on basic knowledge and neglect other important learning areas . Singletary ( 1992 ) also provided such evidence and added that many teachers are uncomfortable addressing environmental values . In addition , formal school settings often have few elements of play and enjoyment ( Block , 1984 ) . The use of a nonformal , field program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all learning areas together , removed from the constraints of a formal curriculum and school environment . Nonformal educational settings also have fewer curricular and other constraints and can provide certain motivational elements -- choice , challenge , novelty , and cooperation -- that can motivate students to learn ( Brophy , 1987 ; Csikszentmihalyi , 1975 ; deCharms , 1984 ; Stipek , 1988 ) . The Program <p> Two small groups of local high school students ( a total of 10 females ) were invited consecutively to the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize in April 1992 for 5 days . All students were in 9th or 10th grade and ranged in age from 15 to 20 . Although environmental education opportunities for Belizean youth are on the increase , the protected areas in Belize are underused for this purpose . Female students in particular are often left out of field experiences and are less likely than male students to visit protected areas ( Emmons , 1994 ) . The students did not indicate any specific interest in nature or the environment , but they participated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses for the students were covered . <p> The broad learning goals in environmental concepts , sensitivity and attitudes , action skills and procedures , and empowerment and ownership were similar for both groups of students , but there were differences in the types of instruction . As part of the plan , different activities were carried out with each group . The purpose of using two different approaches was to gain an understanding of the differences that might occur in the educational processes and outcomes of the two programs . The two approaches are described briefly below . ( A more complete account of the program development and implementation is found in Emmons , 1994 . ) <p> The first group , which contained 6 students , participated in a tacit educational program that allowed students to pursue learning and recreation at their own pace . This program was designed to resemble Fien 's ( 1993 ) education through the environment , given that the program attempted to use student experiences in the environment as the primary educational medium . Some structured activities had been set , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives remained general . The flexibility of the schedule allowed students to make group decisions on many possible activities . With the plans and goals more implicit , l expected that much of the learning would take place in situ , or as it happened , naturally . For example , an observation during a hike might spark a discussion that lasted as long as students showed interest . Unstructured activities included trail hikes , night walks , and evening meetings . Unplanned activities , such as bird watching and informal discussions , also took place . The most important structured activity for this group was an action project ( described later ) . <p> The second group comprised 4 students . This group engaged in more structured activities , and the instruction was more explicit . This program attempted to resemble a shortened version of Fien 's ( 1993 ) education through the environment given that the purpose was to engage students in exploring and resolving environmental issues with an emphasis on lifestyle and social change . Structured activities included an action project and several discussions , including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayan village . Students also had flexibility in helping decide the program schedule when it did not interfere with the plans for structured activities . <p> The two programs also differed in ways that were expected , but not planned , such as in group size , ages of students , individual personalities , and teacher experience . Method <p> The program was evaluated through qualitative research methods that use the perspective of the participants to assess the social climate in an educational setting ( Cantrell , 1993 ; Erickson , 1986 ) . I based the research in part on models of teacher research ( Cochran-Smith &; Lytle , 1993 ) and action research ( Kemmis &; McTaggart , 1982 ; McKernan , 1991 ; Nixon , 1987 ; Robottom , 1985 ) that outline steps for onsite , systematic research by practitioners who are directly involved in the educational setting . This type of research is formative rather than summative , with a focus on the improvement of the curriculum and methods and not a final judgment on their worth . Data were collected before , during , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews , and ancillary sources . These are described more fully below . ( For a more detailed report of the collection and analysis of the data , see Emmons , 1994 . ) Participant Observation <p> Participant observation facilitated the collection of extensive data . While the program was carried out , most of the activities were recorded on audiotape and , in some cases , videotape . The data were later transcribed and generally contained conversations between the students and the teacher . Although participant observation methods generally include field notes , the researcher and the assistant in this study were full participants . They had to perform duties as teachers and leaders and were not always able to write , although they occasionally recorded notes on a tape recorder . McKernan 's ( 1991 ) description of episode analysis was particularly helpful as discourse and events were broken down into smaller episodes that allowed an examination of the relationships between phenomena . The data provided a picture of what occurred during the environmental education program and also revealed how the teacher and students interacted with one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for examining similarities and differences within the teaching and learning processes of the two groups . Questionnaires <p> The purpose of the questionnaire was to provide preprogram and postprogram data to help determine where students exhibited growth or change . Both groups of students received the same questionnaire , and preprogram written questionnaires were administered to both groups at a preparation meeting . The postprogram questionnaires were the same as the preprogram questionnaires and were administered shortly before students left the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary . On both questionnaires , students selected from several preset responses , although some students wrote in their own responses or provided written clarification . Data from the questionnaires were then counted and compared with related data . <p> Group discussions followed the postprogram questionnaires and proved useful . Students in both groups had the opportunity to clarify , elaborate , and correct their responses . Students discussed the items in a hypothetical manner and also provided examples from their own experiences . These discussions were audiotaped and later transcribed for analysis . Questionnaire items that were particularly informative in terms of both discussion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to walk in the forest at night . <p> I would like to have a tiger ( jaguar ) skin in my house for <p> decoration . <p> If I saw a snake in my yard it would be best to have someone kill it . <p> The zoo is the best place for wild animals to live . Interviews <p> All participants were interviewed individually on the first and last days of the Cockscomb visit . Interviews provided data to help determine where students exhibited growth or change . The interviews were semistructured and allowed open-ended responses on the following preset questions : What is the purpose of the sanctuary ? What would happen to this area if the trees were cut and citrus was planted ? If a friend tells you he shot a tiger ( jaguar ) and used its skin for a decoration in his house , what would you tell him ? If you were given the skin as a present , would you accept it ? Do you think it would affect you in any way if there were no more forests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , and other environmental problems ? What is something you could do about environmental problems ? <p> Some of the interview questions were also discussed later with the entire group during the postprogram discussion . In the analysis of interview data , recurring themes across responses were noted and meaningful categories drawn ( McKernan , 1991 ; Spradley , 1979 ) . Interview data were also compared and contrasted with data from other sources . Ancillary Data <p> Student work was collected , including rough drafts and final products of projects , letters , and entries in the Cockscomb visitor 's log . The action project outcomes of both groups were particularly important data sources . Program logs and schedules were collected as a record of what kinds of activities took place and approximately how much time was spent on each . A variety of other recorded material was also collected . In place of written journals and written field notes , notes were recorded daily on audiotape by the teacher . These notes were supplemented by teacher self-interviews and discussions between the teacher and assistant . These data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allowed the teacher and assistant to voice their perceptions and concerns . <p> The data were examined for answers to a series of questions , which in their most general form were the following : In what kinds of activities did participants engage , and what kinds of educational ( and recreational ) opportunities did these activities provide ? What kinds of teaching methods and procedures were employed in these activities ? What factors supported or constrained teaching and learning processes ? What outcomes and patterns of change were apparent ? <p> These questions were employed to guide the process of data analysis to obtain an accurate view of the teaching and learning situations . The Action Project <p> One of the most important activities for both groups was the development of an action project . The project served as a confluence of learning opportunities , but was also helpful in the evaluation of the program . The project provided much of the information for the revision of the positive environmental action model . The voluntary aspect of the project was important . Students were not required to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to select an alternative activity . As an optional activity , the project served as a test of students ' motivation and demonstrated whether the program as a whole could inspire students to become more than just passive recipients of an environmental education program . <p> After listening to an introduction by the teacher , students decided as a group whether or not to proceed with the project , and students in both groups decided to do so . The students were helped initially by a discussion of project options that could be realistically completed during the 5-day program . They then chose , planned , and completed projects , combining their knowledge , feelings , and creative abilities to inform others about some of what they had learned . Students needed guidance and instruction in action skills and procedures , particularly in making initial decisions and plans . The second group , at the end of the project , also needed help with editing . <p> The first group of students produced a simple but sincere information poster for visitors : Take a Look ! ! <p> Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cockscomb is an enjoyable sanctuary . In order for it to stay that way , we should protect animals and trees . Please be careful NOT to pollute the area . The sanctuary has many fascinating places to visit , such as the river , trail tracks , water fall . You can take a look at the Victoria Peak , walk through the forest and do some bird watching . <p> Note : To visitors we should all stand and help to preserve the sanctuary by giving a little DONATION for its betterments sic . <p> The second group produced the article " What the Rainforest Means to Us , " which was later published in the Belize Audubon Society Newsletter . In their article , students discussed conservation and environmental problems , as well as characteristics and attractions of Cockscomb , and ended with a strong message : We Can Make a Difference ! <p> Do you think the rainforest is here because it wanted to be here ? No , everything that is here has its reason to be here , and we can not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country should take more interest and be concerned about preserving the rainforest for the future . Our natural resources such as the forest , all the animals and the plants are important to us . We should be proud of what we have . We should stand up and say what is right about it ; and we will see our success in preserving the beauty of our land and country . <p> In addition , participants in the second group took another form of action entirely on their own when they invited a local environmental activist to speak at their school . This young man had previously spoken to the students at Cockscomb about environmental problems and about personal responsibility for taking action . Reflection and Revision : An Integrative and Interactive Model <p> The analysis of the learning opportunities and learning outcomes of the program suggests that the processes and outcomes of the program fit the model of positive environmental action . Both groups of students participated in and completed action projects as part of a program that also focused on an integration of learning in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also revealed its weaknesses . Although the model seemed to work , some of the outcomes did not appear to be significant as positive environmental action . The question remained as to whether the students would continue to seek out opportunities for action after the end of the program . There was no guarantee that long-term environmental participation would ensue . Moreover , the model did not seem to illustrate adequately the intentional and independent action of Group 2 students when they invited the activist to speak at their school , an action that occurred outside the boundaries of the program . The new information showed that the original model of positive environmental action did not represent adequately the types of long-term actions that would qualify as part of Fien 's ( 1993 ) education for the environment and its potential for contributing to social transformation . The critical reflection on the study and its results , as well as the questions raised by this reflection , eventually led to a rethinking of the original model and its methodology . The model was then revised to illustrate better the emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive environmental action ( see Figure 2 ) . <p> The outcomes of the second group of students in particular provided most of the new information for the model 's revision . For this reason , and as a result of space limitations , the illustration of the revised model contains only data from this group . The data serve to illustrate two important features of the revised model . One feature , the integration of the learning areas , was present in the original model , but could be illustrated in more detail with data from the program . The second feature , which is an interactive relationship between learning and action , was added after the analysis of the data was complete . Integrated Learning Areas <p> The revised model of positive environmental action shows that the learning areas interact to create a complex learning system . Program activities provided opportunities for integrated learning ( see Table 1 ) . For example , during the night walk activity , students were able to examine and discuss interesting elements of nature ( see Figure 3 ) . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could later use in the action project . Instruction in action skills and procedures helped students with the planning and decisions needed for writing the article . Without the project , students may not have had the opportunity for translating an activity like the night walk into verbal form . Interactive Relationship <p> The interactive relationship between environmental education learning areas and positive environmental action is an important feature of the revised model . There is a circularity or reciprocity to this relationship , with the suggestion that students grow and learn as they carry out an action . This interactive relationship may take place entirely within the field setting , or it may begin there and continue in other settings . <p> Data from the action project reflect learning in both the processes and outcomes of the activity . Thus , students ' participation in their project not only resulted in an action outcome , but also appeared to contribute directly to further learning . Data collected through participant observation suggest that the students were learning or refining action skills and procedures , such as planning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Table 2 ) . In their reflections on their completed work , students demonstrated realistic perspectives about what their article could actually achieve . They suggested , for example , that the article might help other students in their research . Each student 's contribution to the article reflected what she had learned during the program , and group cooperation resulted in the article 's completion . <p> An important aspect of the second program occurred when students took action entirely on their own by inviting an environmentalist to speak at their school and by asking their principal for permission . This action suggested that students had learned action skills and procedures ( such as planning and cooperation ) and had gained empowerment and ownership ( such as personal responsibility ) . Their action also took place outside the field setting , indicating that students made use of continued opportunities even after the program ended . The action might have been inspired by the program , but it was not directed by the instruction or bounded by program limits ( see Table 3 ) . However , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place outside of the field setting , some of the processes and outcomes remain speculative . Conclusion <p> The revised model of positive environmental action more adequately represents the continuous and dynamic processes that are believed possible when people in a particular social situation establish goals and procedures for their own actions . The participants within the setting begin to actively influence the processes of their growth and change , even when they may be encouraged initially by an environmental education program or some other event . When students are inspired to take action , follow-up activities that allow for continued cycles of growth and action appear to be important . Ideally , individuals and groups involved in environmental action make use of opportunities to reflect on and evaluate their initial action . They examine their growth and learning from past actions while they plan new ones . In this way , positive environmental action is a formative process as much as a final goal . At any point , the action goal may be achieved , hut the goals can adapt and grow as new information and skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutually created and changed by participants within their social situation . <p> Future ideas and information may provide additional material for revision of the positive environmental action model . The next step is to better document the relationships between learning and action , particularly continued cycles of action within and beyond the field setting . More case studies could reveal how environmental education programs involve students in positive environmental action . More important , such studies might serve to examine the greater issue of how participation in environmental education may bring about meaningful and long-term social transformation .

@@4012441 Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent ( Fig. 1 ) , painted by Francisco Goya ( 1746-1828 ) in 1788 , is one of the most astonishing works in an oeuvre replete with remarkable images . In the decade and a half since its inclusion in Robert Rosenblum 's survey of nineteenth-century art , this canvas has become widely known among scholars and their students . Rosenblum , following a line of interpretation that dates back to the middle of the nineteenth century , uses this painting to support a symptomatic reading of Goya 's art , which he describes as " the most sharply accurate mirror of the collapse of the great religious and monarchic traditions of the West . " ( n1 ) Goya scholars also have tended to view the work as marking a significant turning point , albeit within a more circumscribed frame of reference , for it is in this picture that the fantastic makes its initial appearance in the artist 's work. ( n2 ) Absent from both of these interpretive models is any suggestion of how the painting might have been understood at the time of its creation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little in the way of documentary evidence around which to construct a context . The one known document is an invoice dated October 16 , 1788 , in which the artist requests payment from the duke and duchess of Osuna for " two pictures that he has painted , representing passages in the life of Saint Francis Borgia for the new chapel that has been constructed at your expense in the Cathedral of Valencia . " ( n3 ) The paintings were intended for the side walls of a chapel honoring the sixteenth-century saint , who had served as third father general of the Society of Jesus and was a famous ancestor of the duchess of Osuna . The Osunas were among the artist 's most important patrons over the next fifteen years , commissioning a wide range of works , beginning with a pair of portraits of the duke and duchess in 1785 ( G-W 219 , 220 ) . ( n4 ) In 1787 Goya delivered a series of seven pictures depicting " rural themes " for their country house on the outskirts of Madrid ( G-W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family portrait ( G-W 278 ) and undertook the paintings depicting Saint Francis Borgia , after whom the Osuna heir had been named . In the late 1790s the Osunas commissioned a group of small-scale scenes of witchcraft for their country house ( G-W 659-64 ) , and they purchased four sets of the Caprichos in January 1799 . Around that time , Goya again painted the duke 's portrait ( G-W 674 ) , and in 1805 he executed a stunning portrait of their daughter , the marchioness of Santa Cruz , dressed in Empire fashion ( G-W 828 ) . <p> Although nothing is known of the terms of the Borgia chapel commission , the works by Goya would have been intended to complement the main altarpiece , painted by one of his artistic rivals , Mariano Salvador Maella ( 1739-1819 ) . ( n5 ) Dedicated on October 10 , 1788 , Maella 's canvas ( in situ and in poor condition ) portrays The Conversion of Francis Borgia , Duke of Gandia , an event that occurred when he saw the decayed corpse of the Empress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly realized the transitory nature of earthly pleasures . Goya 's picture for the left wall of the chapel , entitled Saint Francis Borgia Taking Leave of His Family ( G-W 240 ) , narrates the result of the religious awakening depicted in Maella 's altarpiece . The duke , having been widowed in middle age , bids farewell to his relatives as he departs to join the Jesuit order upon the maturity of his eldest son . The work is anecdotal and sentimental in character , with Francis and his heir embracing on the steps of the family palace at Gandia while other members of the family and household look on. ( n6 ) The emotional reactions of the assembled figures , enacted through individualized physiognomies , lend the canvas an air of pathos , while the richly painted brocades and draperies bring to mind the rich surfaces of Giambattista Tiepolo , who had worked in Spain as first court painter to Carlos III from 1762 until the former 's death in 1770. ( n7 ) <p> In contrast to this costume piece , Saint Francis Borgia at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , presents the viewer with a truly amazing mystical drama . The saint is dressed in a simple priest 's robe , his head encircled by a ring of divine light that echoes the form of the window behind him . Holding a crucifix in one hand , the other raised in a gesture of astonishment , he stares spellbound toward the figure laid out before him . The dying man 's agonies are inscribed unmistakably and with striking frankness in his naked body : the rigid limbs , heaving chest , sunken eyes , slightly open mouth , and grasping hand all suggest his suffering , and these torments are underscored by the agitated sheets that partially conceal his flesh . In addition to the two protagonists , four demonic creatures hover in a cluster behind the sinner , their infernal origin indicated by the flames surrounding them . Frank Heckes has pointed out that the subject depicted here is not an exorcism , as had been assumed previously , but rather a damnation that is narrated in vivid detail in an eighteenth-century account of the saint 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vida , virtudes , y milagros del grande S. Francisco de Borja . The text , which Goya 's painting closely matches , describes how the carved image of the crucified Christ held by Francis , having realized that the soul of a particular dying man could not be saved , <p> ... detached its the Crucifix 's nailed fight arm , and placing its hand in that profusely bleeding lacerated wound in its chest , withdrew a fist filled with blood , and hurled it with indignation at the frowning , denigrated face , saying " Since you scorn this blood , which was shed for your glory , let it serve for your eternal unhappiness . " Then that pitiful man , with an awful , blasphemous shout directed against Jesus Christ , gave up his soul , convulsed by a horrid moan , and it was turned over to the infamous ministers of fire and fright. ( n8 ) <p> Goya 's pictorialization of these " infamous ministers of fire and fright " emphasizes their fantastic character , and nothing in the artist 's work up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hardly surprising , then , that these creatures have been the focus of most modern scholarship on the painting . Usually they are viewed teleologically , as the ancestors of the imaginary beings who populate much of the work that Goya would execute during the second half of the 1790s , including the witchcraft paintings for the Osuna country house ( ca. 1797-98 ) and the print series the Caprichos , as well as the drawings leading up to it ( 1797-99 ) , and who would return periodically in the artist 's subsequent uncommissioned art. ( n9 ) In addition to regarding the demons in the Valencia painting as antecedents for the supernatural strain in Goya 's later career , efforts have been made to locate visual precedents for them , with the art of Hieronymus Bosch , Spanish medieval images of the Last Judgment , and Henry Fuseli 's Nightmare frequently cited by scholars as possible sources of inspiration. ( n10 ) Moreover , it is tempting to suggest that the Osunas ' taste for the supernatural in the 1790s dictated the presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Nigel Glendinning has pointed out , their taste was more conservative in the 1780s. ( n11 ) <p> In this essay , I wish to propose another means of approaching Goya 's painting , one that views it not as a harbinger of things to come , as based on specific artistic precedents , or as circumscribed by the conditions of patronage , but rather as deeply embedded in aesthetic developments taking place in Spain around the time of its creation . As a point of departure , I will examine the analysis of the picture offered by Pedro de Silva in the oration he wrote for the 1795 prize-giving ceremony of the Royal Academy of S. Carlos in Valencia. ( n12 ) Silva 's text is one of the few substantial contemporary commentaries on Goya 's art that has come down to us , and his reading of the image differs fundamentally from that proposed in recent scholarship . Rather than focusing on the demons , he centers his discussion on the dying man , as indicated in the title he uses to refer to the painting : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Seo ) . Only at the end of his analysis -- and in a single sentence -- does he mention the " zealous " attitude of the saint , and the " other figures los demas personajes " who react to the events before them with " admiration , surprise , and terror " ( 30 ) . Modern scholars have taken Silva 's ambiguous reading of the ontology of these monsters ( that is , as " personajes " ) to indicate that he did not understand their demonic nature . As a result , when his text is mentioned at all it is relegated to the footnotes and used to suggest that Goya 's contemporaries often failed to grasp the meaning of his art. ( n13 ) <p> I intend to argue that the significance of Silva 's analysis lies not in its validity as a " correct " or definitive interpretation , but rather in the conceptual tools that he brings to bear on the image . Written by a member of the artistic establishment during an important juncture in the development of aesthetic thought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " los inteligentes " would have had for such a painting , in terms of both the techniques employed by the artist to create it and the methods by which the viewer was imagined to decode its meaning. ( n14 ) In particular , two related issues that Silva addresses in examining the work -- the expressive character of the human figure and the nature of artistic imitation -- were widely discussed in the orations delivered at the prize-giving ceremonies of the royal academies in Madrid and Valencia , as well as in aesthetic treatises written during the final two decades of the eighteenth century . Silva 's attention to the semiotics of the body in Goya 's painting will provide a lens through which to consider important changes that took place in progressive aesthetic thought in Spain in the final years of the century . These developments , in which Silva played an important role , revolve around a shift from the classicizing idealism advocated by Anton Raphael Mengs and his Spanish followers toward a more naturalistic approach to the making of art . <p> Expression and imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a late twentieth-century art historian -- can bring to bear on this painting . Rather , these issues will be seen to have informed Goya 's practice as an artist during the 1780s and 1790s . His involvement in the affairs of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando in Madrid , which he served as assistant director of painting from 1785 until 1795 and then as director of painting until 1797 , suggest that he would have been familiar with the aesthetic developments and debates taking place within that institution. ( n15 ) Careful examination of the religious paintings and tapestry cartoons that Goya executed during this period will reveal a conscious and evolving engagement with the semantic potential of the human figure that reflects ideas being articulated by the advisers to the academies in Madrid and Valencia . Moreover , by examining Goya 's output of these years in terms of expression and imitation , I hope to indicate that his religious works and tapestry cartoons , two aspects of his production that have been treated separately in the literature , are animated by a common set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the figure should be considered in relation to recent analyses of the representation of the body in French painting of the same period . In particular , the art of Jacques-Louis David and his pupils has been the subject of several important studies that have centered on the depiction of the human figure. ( n16 ) Although the artistic ( not to mention the political ) circumstances are quite different in late eighteenth-century Spain , it is revealing to examine Goya 's painting as an important episode in the rethinking of Neoclassical attitudes toward human form that takes place in a variety of contexts at the end of the eighteenth century . Pedro de Silva and His Analysis of Goya 's Painting <p> As a son of the marquis of S. Cruz , Pedro de Silva ( 1742-1808 ) enjoyed an important career at the Bourbon court in Madrid . His activities included a keen and prolonged involvement in the affairs of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando , to which King Carlos III named him an honorary member ( academico de honor ) in 1766 and an adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claude Bedat as one of the few advisers with any aesthetic sense , he was part of a reforming faction that centered around Antonio Ponz , secretary of the academy from 1776 until 1790 , and also included Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos , among others. ( n17 ) Silva was primarily interested in architecture , having been accepted by the academy as an artist member ( academico de merito ) in that art form in 1768 . In 1772 he delivered the oration at the triennial prize-giving ceremony , in which he addressed the topic of artistic imitation , focusing on the role of imitation in architecture. ( n18 ) But beyond this particular interest , Silva was involved in every major decision made during these crucial decades , and he played an important role in the debates on educational reform that occupied much of the collective energy of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando from 1792 until 1798. ( n19 ) Like many important figures in this academy , Silva was named an honorary member of the Royal Academy of S. Carlos in Valencia , which was the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearly subordinate role to its parent institution in Madrid. ( n20 ) Silva was asked to write the oration for the 1795 prize-giving ceremony in Valencia , and it is within this context that his remarks on Goya 's painting occur . <p> As in his oration of 1772 in Madrid , Silva chose to speak on the imitation of nature. ( n21 ) After some general remarks describing imitation as always having been the object of the arts and insisting on truth as the artist 's only guide , Silva turns to Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent . He begins by picturing a viewer standing before it , a scenario that might seem surprising at first , given the audience of art students that his address was intended to instruct . Moreover , unlike the students , members , and advisers of the academy , the spectator that Silva delineates is not versed in the practice , theory , and history of art . Instead , he describes a simple mother who brings her disobedient son to look at Goya 's picture " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The focus of their attention is the dying sinner , whose body and facial expression reveal " a soul violently agitated by the cruel regrets of its crimes , and of the hopeless conviction of its approaching eternal damnation " ( 28 ) . Turning his attention to the artist for a moment , Silva employs the overblown rhetoric typical of these orations to suggest that the careful study of nature has permitted Goya to create a convincing depiction of the sinner 's afflictions : <p> You , beautiful nature , you , so varied in your productions , you taught the observant artist the violent convulsions that the desperation of the soul causes in the muscles of the body ; you recited to him the effects that the violent contraction of the muscles necessarily produces in the instantaneous deformation of all of the features ; you demonstrated to him that in this state the circulation of the fluids is suspended , and precisely how the color of the flesh changes .... ( 29 ) . <p> The artist 's naturalistic depiction of the sinner 's body , Silva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive faculties of those who view it . " Even if the spectator might be the most ignorant and common person as the mother clearly is intended to be a chain of thoughts occurs that persuades him convincingly of the extreme degree of desperation and fury that have come to this unhappy man " ( 30 ) . This involuntary mental process entails unconsciously comparing Goya 's representation of the dying man 's features and body to an archive of images of people agitated by violent passions , which the woman 's sense of sight has stored in her mind . Since the characteristics that she discovers in this figure are " stronger and more evident , livelier and more vehement " ( 29 ) than any she has witnessed previously in nature , she concludes that the passion animating his body must be more violent than any she has ever encountered . The other figures , whom she notices only secondarily , according to Silva , serve to reinforce the interpretation that the representation of the sinner 's body has led her to make . Thus , the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist 's exacting imitation of nature , through which he communicates to the beholder the physical and psychological agony of the scene . It is in this way that Goya 's painting provides an example for the students of the academy to follow . The Concept of Expression in Eighteenth-Century Spain <p> In his imagined scenario , Silva articulates a central tenet of Western aesthetic thought : the belief in the expressive character of the human body . This semiotic model presents the body as a visual text to be decoded by the viewer , with external physical signifiers such as pose , gesture , and facial expression encoding the passions , emotions , and inclinations that animate the figure . From this premise , it follows that the skillful practitioner of the art of painting or sculpture " does not simply portray the material aspect of the body ; he also manages to describe and express for us the invisible characteristics of the soul " ( 28 ) . Silva had advocated the same notion in his 1772 oration , in which he states , " The appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make known the passion possessed by the figure being represented " ( 56 ) . <p> These principles regarding expression had been established during the Italian Renaissance by Leon Battista Alberti ( 1404-1472 ) and Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452-1519 ) , and their writings were widely available in Spain at the end of the eighteenth century , thanks to translations by Diego Antonio Rejon de Silva that were published in a single volume in 1784 . In book 2 of On Painting ( 1435 ) , Alberti outlines the requirements for a successful composition and states , " In order that those looking at the picture will be most attentive , it is necessary that the inanimate figures it contains appear as if they are alive by expressing the passions of their souls .... These movements of the soul are made known by those of the body .... " ( n22 ) For his part , Leonardo insists that painted figures should be represented " so that on viewing them one knows immediately what they are thinking or what they wish to say , " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for guidance. ( n23 ) But in contrast to Alberti 's emphasis on decorum and selective imitation , Leonardo advocates a greater liveliness of expression , famously remarking that without the variety provided by the accidents of nature the depicted figures will appear " twice dead . " ( n24 ) In addition to translating the texts of these Renaissance authors , Rejon de Silva advocated their ideas in his own writings of the 1780s . In 1786 , for example , he published a lengthy poem , entitled La pintura , that put Neoclassical principles into verse . In it he refers to the human face as the " involuntary index / Of the heart , and no less constant " and mentions Alberti and Raphael among his sources. ( n25 ) These were ideas that Rejon would have advocated to his colleagues in the Madrid academy , to which he was named an honorary member in 1780 and an adviser in 1787 . <p> Another important formulation of the concept of expression was the method codified in the seventeenth century by the French painter , theorist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) His system for representing the passions , outlined in an illustrated lecture to the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1668 , was first published in 1698 as Conference de M. Le Brun sur l'expression generale et particuliere . The juxtaposition in this volume ( and countless others based on it ) of highly legible line drawings of the face with brief descriptions of the effects of various mental states on the human features proved to be an easily adaptable method that quickly became one of the cornerstones of academic doctrine throughout Europe . Le Brun 's text provided a means of depicting expression that is based not on an artist 's direct observation ( as had been encouraged by Alberti and Leonardo ) , but rather on his adherence to an established set of pictorial signs that often were followed prescriptively . Moreover , Le Brun privileges the face over the rest of the figure and views the effects of the passions as universal , giving no account of how their somatic manifestation might be conditioned by age , nationality , climate , or other particularizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct impact of Le Brun 's ideas in Spain , engravings after his Battles of Alexander , which are a veritable catalogue of the expressive possibilities of the human features , were owned by the Royal Academy of S. Fernando. ( n27 ) Moreover , a book entitled Ensayo sobre el origen y naturaleza de las pasiones , del gesto y de la accion teatral indicates that his approach to representing the passions was not unknown during the final decades of the eighteenth century. ( n28 ) The author of this volume , Fermin Eduardo Zeglirscosac , notes that he has relied on Le Brun 's Conference , ( n29 ) and the illustrations drawn by Francisco de Paula Marti Mora appear to derive from editions of Le Brun 's treatise . Although this text was published more than a decade after Goya 's paintings for the Borgia chapel , the similarity between the dying man 's features in the deathbed scene and the plate depicting " physical pain " ( Fig. 2 , above right ) -- particularly the open mouth and the flaring nostrils -- suggest Goya 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind Goya 's image , as it advises that in a figure who is experiencing physical suffering , an " affection of restlessness and activity will manifest itself by the tension of the muscles .... " ( n30 ) <p> A treatise with a much more direct impact on Spanish artists and theorists throughout the eighteenth century was El museo pictorico y escala optica ( 1715-24 ) by the artist and theorist Antonio Palomino ( 1655-1726 ) . ( n31 ) The index of terms at the end of the first volume of Palomino 's three-volume text offers a concise definition of " expresion " as the " action of expressing the passions and inclinations in a figure or narrative that is being painted . " ( n32 ) The second volume , entitled Practica de la pintura , includes a chapter dedicated to physiognomy that begins by establishing the indexical character of the body : " It is a steadfast principle of natural philosophy that the constitution of the human body , and the representation of the face , are infallible indices of the passions and inclinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brun 's emphasis on facial features , Palomino asserts that although the countenance plays the principal role in revealing internal mental states , the other parts of the figure also have a share , since their configuration depends on " the interior passions and propensities of the mind . " ( n34 ) He goes on to discuss the body as a signifier of both habitual and momentary attitudes , and furnishes descriptions of many of them ( although no illustrations ) , alluding to Leonardo 's Treatise on Painting in the process. ( n35 ) <p> Goya includes Palomino 's Practica de la pintura in his 1783 portrait of the count of Floridablanca ( G-W 203 ) , indicating its status as an emblem of academic thought during the second half of the eighteenth century . This treatise , its title visible on the spine of the binding , serves as an attribute of the sitter 's role as protector of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando . Leaning against the table are plans for the Imperial de Aragon , which , together with Palomino 's text , inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretical principles of art and their application to solving practical concerns , a pragmatic approach typical of the Spanish Enlightenment. ( n36 ) This duality is made flesh by the juxtaposition of Goya 's self-image , presenting a picture for the count 's inspection , with an unidentified engineer standing in the background . <p> By far the most influential source for late eighteenth-century Spanish ideas on the semiotics of the figure were the paintings and writings of the German Neoclassical artist Anton Raphael Mengs ( 1728-1779 ) . Shortly after completing his famous ceiling in the Villa Albani in Rome , Mengs was called to Madrid in the summer of 1761 to serve as first court painter to Carlos III , a post that he held until his death in 1779. ( n37 ) Mengs devoted most of his attention to the decoration of the Royal Palace in Madrid , but he also executed portraits and religious images . Although he only played a major role in the daily affairs of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando for a couple of years in the mid-1760s , Mengs cast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , particularly in the years following his death in 1779 . A Spanish edition of his writings , translated by his friend Jose Nicolas de Azara , was published in 1780. ( n38 ) In the Royal Academy of S. Fernando prize-giving oration of 1781 -- the first following Mengs 's death -- Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos describes his writings as " the catechism of good taste and the code of professors and lovers of the arts , " and he alludes to " the shadow of Mengs , of the son of Apollo and Minerva , of the philosopher painter , of the master , of the benefactor and the legislator of the arts . " ( n39 ) Bedat suggests that the impact of Mengs reached its apogee in 1784 and that his Neoplatonic outlook had a profound impact on the advisers to the academy , who mention him frequently in their orations. ( n40 ) But Mengs 's influence was not purely theoretical , as the professors of the academy were deeply affected by the example of his practice as an artist . Mariano Maella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Goya 's brother-in-law Francisco Bayeu ( 1734-1795 ) were among the German artist 's closest followers. ( n41 ) <p> A summary of Mengs 's aesthetic thought appeared in 1776 in the form of a lengthy letter written to Antonio Ponz , who became secretary of the Royal Academy of San Fernando that same year . Ponz included the letter in volume four of his Viaje de Espana ( 1772-94 ) , a monumentally important eighteen-volume undertaking in which he sought to catalogue and describe the cultural riches of Spain . Before discussing the paintings and frescoes in the Royal Palace in Madrid ( the topic of his letter ) , Mengs outlines a hierarchy of artistic styles that progresses from the ideal to the real . After describing the " sublime style , " the " beautiful style , " and the " graceful style , " he comes to the " significant or expressive style . " Mengs indicates his opinion of this mode by summarizing antique attitudes toward it : " The ancient Greeks favored the beautiful over the expressive , preferring not to disfigure forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n42 ) Thus , in focusing too much on the representation of the passions an artist runs the risk of introducing accidental elements into the composition that are at odds with the creation of ideal beauty , which Mengs had come to value in Rome under the influence of his friend , theorist and antiquarian Johann Joachim Winckelmann ( 1717-1768 ) . <p> Nevertheless , Mengs considered expression to be a fundamental aspect of the art of painting , and he held a deep admiration for the depiction of the passions in the art of Raphael , which he saw as paradigmatic of the expressive style . However , in praising Raphael , he criticizes other modern artists -- for whom we might imagine Le Brun and adherents to his method -- for the affectation that often enters into expression in their works . In discussing Raphael 's style of drawing , Mengs writes : <p> That which , above all else , causes amazement ... is that the character of the painted figures corresponds in such a way to the actions in which they are represented that one seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather by natural inclination , is engaged in the activity depicted by Raphael , and this is apparent not only in the physiognomy , which makes known the state of mind of men , but also in the complete form of his body and its parts. ( n43 ) <p> His esteem for the Italian artist is manifested in a series of drawings after the heads found in the School of Athens , which were engraved during the mid-1780s by the Italian printmaker Domenico Cunego and published in a folio entitled Cabezas de personages de la escuela de Atenas de Rafael. ( n44 ) <p> Through Mengs , Raphael exercised an important influence on Spanish thought and practice regarding expression . In La pintura ( 1786 ) , Rejon de Silva voices admiration for Raphael 's portrayal of the passions and singles out The Fall on the Road to Calvary , then hanging in the Royal Palace in Madrid , for special praise. ( n45 ) Moreover , the library of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando owned several volumes of reproductive prints after Raphael 's work , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raphael appears to have been the best-represented artist in the reproductive print holdings. ( n46 ) Into the 1790s artists in the Madrid academy continued to view Raphael 's art as the paradigm of expression . For example , during the debates of 1792 on reforming the academy 's educational program , the painter Luis Paret y Alcazar and Manuel Salvador Carmona , the director of engraving and Mengs 's son-in-law , both recommended in their reports that students be required to study the heads in the paintings of Raphael. ( n47 ) Expression in Goya 's Art , 1780-99 <p> Goya 's religious paintings of the 1780s , leading up to the Valencia commission , indicate his profound interest in the expressive potential of the human figure . The Christ on the Cross ( Fig. 3 ) of 1780 adheres closely to the Mengsian paradigm of idealizing expression . In fact , the disposition of the figure is closely related to a representation of the same subject by Mengs ( Fig. 4 ) , which hung in the bedroom of Carlos III in the Royal Palace at Aranjuez. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an upturned gaze that makes him accessible to the viewer and could plausibly be derived from handbooks on representing the passions . In each case the body is presented in a graceful contrapposto pose and with little evidence of physical suffering aside from a few discreet drops of blood around the crown of thorns , the nails in the feet , and on the cloth . This minimizing of the physical aspects of the Crucifixion is quite different from the concealed face and emphasis on the body in the Christ on the Cross by Diego Velazquez ( Fig. 5 ) , after whose works in the Spanish royal collection Goya had executed a series of prints in 1778. ( n49 ) Velazquez 's painting foregrounds the somatic nature of the subject , featuring a visible wound , blood-streaked hands and feet , and a sharp lighting that emphasizes Christ 's corporeality . <p> In Mengs 's letter of 1776 on the royal collection , Velazquez exemplifies the " naturalistic style , " which is discussed after the " expressive style " and just before Mengs turns to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , is informed by the principle of imitating selectively from nature , a classically inspired concept that Mengs emphasized in his writings , which were published in Spain the year that Goya executed this painting : " ... if a picture contains the most beautiful parts of nature , and each one shows the truth within it , it will be a work of good taste .... " ( n50 ) The artist 's goal is to create a figure of ideal beauty that surpasses nature by virtue of the perfection of its forms . Significantly , this painting served as Goya 's reception piece for entry into the Royal Academy of S. Fernando . In aligning himself with Mengs rather than Velazquez , Goya was attempting to gain admission into the academy by appealing to the current tastes of its members and advisers . His intention would have been to demonstrate his ability to paint religious subjects in the favored , idealizing manner at a time when he would have been known primarily as a painter of lower-class genre scenes of peasants and majos , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being called to Madrid by Mengs in the winter of 1774. ( n51 ) <p> In the wake of this demonstration piece , Goya 's religious paintings of the next several years reveal a more varied and pragmatic treatment of the human form as a carrier of meaning . In these works the artist is careful to take into account the specific demands of the subject , the commission , and the context in which the painting was to be seen . Nevertheless , Goya continues to operate , to varying degrees , within the framework for depicting the figure set forth by Mengs . The canvas portraying Saint Bernardine of Siena Preaching before Alfonso V of Aragon ( Fig. 6 ) is noteworthy for its varied treatment of face and gesture . Commissioned in 1781 for the church of S. Francisco el Grande in Madrid but not unveiled until 1784 , this work portrays the Franciscan saint addressing a deeply attentive audience . The wide range in age , physiognomy , and gesture conveys an individuality of response among the listeners . Goya includes his own likeness at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mengs 's self-portrait at the left of his Adoration of the Shepherds ( Fig. 7 ) , commissioned by Carlos III in 1770 and hanging in the Royal Palace in Madrid. ( n52 ) Although at the opposite end of the social hierarchy from Goya 's courtiers , the shepherds in Mengs 's painting also exhibit disparate reactions to the miracle before them , and they display the same combination of humility and nobility that characterizes the noblemen and their attendants in Goya 's painting . <p> Closer examination reveals that aside from the similar emphasis on expression , the two works exhibit important differences , in Mengs 's painting , the garments worn by the shepherds and Joseph suggest that these figures are intended to evoke classical statuary , while the Virgin is reminiscent of figures found in the art . of Raphael , and Mengs himself acts as the intercessor found in many Renaissance paintings . Goya , by contrast , infuses his image with a greater degree of naturalism , treating a religious subject as if it were a history painting . The elegant and colorful costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specificity of the image and to create an air of historical accuracy , although , in fact , they date from several centuries after the event depicted. ( n53 ) The sense of naturalism is intensified by the circumscription of supernatural allusions to the shaft of divine light and the star above the saint 's head , in contrast to the angels who occupy the upper third of Mengs 's image . The earthbound tenor of Goya 's picture is even more striking in the context of the works painted for the same church by his rivals , including Maella and Francisco Bayeu. ( n54 ) The profusion of clouds and angels in their productions are probably a direct response to similar elements in the unfinished Annunication by Mengs that Carlos III ordered to be installed in the council room of the Madrid Academy in 1780 as an example to the professors and their students. ( n55 ) <p> Following his modest success with the canvas for S. Francisco el Grande , Goya obtained a number of important religious commissions . Perhaps most significant among these was the royal commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side altars of the convent of S. Ana in Valladolid. ( n56 ) For this project , Goya utilized a more strictly classicizing artistic mode that has none of the specificity of detail found in the depiction of Saint Bernardine . Among the S. Ana paintings , The Death of Saint Joseph ( Fig. 8 ) is crucial for our understanding of the development of the Valencia deathbed scene , perhaps begun in the same year . Its precisely structured composition portrays Christ and Mary making restrained gestures of grief at the instant of Joseph 's death , which his gracefully clasped hands and heavy eyelids indicate to be a moment of peaceful surrender to his fate . The carefully painted , heavily draped figures have a generalized quality reflective of the principle of selective imitation , which was championed in the oration delivered at the prize-giving ceremony of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando held on July 14 , 1787 , a couple of months before the dedication of the convent . In that address , the duke of Almodovar invoked the " immortal Mengs " in stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect imitation of the most carefully chosen nature .... " ( n57 ) <p> Compositionally , however , The Death of Saint Joseph has a pared-down , geometric quality that is more austere than Mengs 's approach . Mary 's tilted pose and the broad swath of divine light ( an expansion of that which falls on Saint Bernardine ) create intersecting diagonals that are balanced by the right angle formed by Christ and Joseph . The result is an emphasis on order and decorum , in both execution and mood , that echoes the classically inspired austerity of the building , which had been designed by court architect Francisco Sabatini. ( n58 ) In a letter to Martin Zapater , Goya captures the tenor of the painting by alluding to the " architectonic style estilo arquitecttnico , " which he notes is in fashion at the moment. ( n59 ) <p> Although The Appearance of Saint Francis by Michel-Ange Houasse ( 1722 ) has been proposed as a source for the composition of Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent , ( n60 ) a preliminary drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death of Saint Joseph as a point of departure for the Valencia painting . The basic compositional structure of the drawing appears to derive from the relation between Christ and Joseph ; however , the upper body and head of the dying man are turned slightly toward the viewer . These subtle changes have significant ramifications for the observer 's relation to the image , as they break down the " fourth wall " and force the viewer into dialogue with the depicted figure . An even more direct engagement with the viewer had been present in an oil study for The Death of St. Joseph ( Fig. 10 ) , in which a foreshortened deathbed projects into the observer 's space and the anguished expression of the saint becomes the composition 's focal point . The emotionalism in the oil sketch for S. Ana is heightened by the emphasis on the relationship between father and son , enacted through their reciprocal gazes and Christ 's embracing gesture . Another important similarity between this sketch and the preliminary drawing for the Valencia Cathedral work is the presence of supernatural figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final version of The Death of Saint Joseph . In the drawing of Saint Francis Borgia and the dying man , several loosely outlined beings occupy the upper half of the image ; the one on the right , who seems to have horns , might represent a fleeing demon who has been exorcized . In spite of these common elements , the crucial difference between these two images is the exposure of the dying man 's body in the sketch for the Borgia painting . <p> By the time Goya made an oil sketch for the Osuna commission ( Fig. 11 ) , the subject had changed from exorcism ( or possibly extreme unction ) to damnation , with the demonic identity of the creatures now made plain by their monstrous forms ( not fully visible in the illustration ) . Moreover , the appeal to the viewer has been significantly increased by replacing the profile view of the saint in the preliminary drawing with a frontal pose and theatrical gestures that are mirrored in his wide-eyed , frowning expression. ( n61 ) In addition , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an intensified sense of suffering in his features , particularly apparent in the sunken eyes and open mouth . Taken as a whole , the order and generalization of the drawing have given way to a sense of frenzied antagonism and a specificity of forms , as the dying man 's restless agony contrasts dramatically with Saint Francis 's pious zeal . The distinct vertical line created by the edge of the curtain marks this opposition by firmly dividing the composition in two . At the same time , however , the exposed right foot of the condemned man just touches the saint 's robe , establishing a sense of interrelation between them . <p> The final painting includes alterations to the composition of the oil sketch designed to lend the work a more harmonious feeling . Goya reduced the number of demons and clarified their forms , softened the folds of the curtain , and introduced a greater degree of idealization into the figure of Saint Francis. ( n62 ) The saint 's more balanced pose echoes that of Saint Bernardine in the painting for S. Francisco el @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . But the unflinching naturalism of the sinner 's body , which so interests Pedro de Silva in his address to the Valencia academy , remains intact . In fact , it is deepened by exposure of more of his midsection and the introduction of the clenching gesture of his hand . Within the context of Goya 's religious paintings of the 1780s , the emotional extremes of the two principal figures in this work signify his ultimate rejection of the idealizing concept of expression advocated by Mengs and his Spanish followers . Indeed , the sharp contrast in expression around which Goya 's image is structured creates just the sort of affectation to which Mengs had objected in his letter on the paintings in the Royal Palace in Madrid . Moreover , the emphasis on face and gesture in Goya 's previous religious works has been replaced by a concept of expression that encompasses the entire figure. ( n63 ) <p> Although this lack of idealization is unique in the artist 's sacred works up to this point , parallels for the naturalism of the condemned man occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later 1780s for the Royal Tapestry Factory . One such example is the cartoon depicting Summer , or The Harvest ( Fig. 12 ) , commissioned in 1786 as part of a series of the four seasons for the dining room of the prince and princess of Asturias in the Pardo Palace. ( n64 ) This canvas , the largest of Goya 's tapestry cartoons , portrays a moment of repose from the work in the fields as figures laze in an idyllic , golden landscape . Goya provides a compendium of the expressive possibilities of the human face and figure , from the alarm of the women behind the hay cart to the complete rest of the man lying in front of her . The contrast between the crying baby and the smiling figures at the center of the groups around it brings to mind comments by both Alberti and Leonardo on the difficulty the painter confronts in differentiating these two facial expressions , a feat that Goya proves he is capable of accomplishing . The group standing at the left is particularly interesting in terms of its variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three companions , one of whom fills his glass while another holds his rake and the third steadies him . The central figure 's foolish grin and unfocused , cross-eyed gaze signify his inebriation . His disheveled clothes and spread-legged stance , which suggests a lack of balance , offer a sharp contrast to the graceful pose of the figure with the flask . The somatic disparity between these two figures , and the knowing glances of the other surrounding companions , lend the work a comic tone . <p> The particularity of expression in this composition characterizes several of the sketches and cartoons for tapestries that Goya executed during the later 1780s. ( n65 ) As a whole , these works represent a departure from the round-faced , idealized peasants found in his cartoons of the 1770s , whose formulaic physiognomies are holdovers from the late Baroque style popular during the artist 's youth. ( n66 ) Thus , the sinner in Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent is part of a general shift in Goya 's work toward a more naturalistic mode of imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These developments continue into the early 1790s and reach a critical stage -- it is tempting to call it a crisis -- in the Yard with Lunatics of 1793-94 ( Fig. 13 ) . This small-scale work was the last in the series of uncommissioned cabinet paintings that Goya executed during his long convalescence from the life-threatening illness that struck him late in 1792. ( n67 ) Through its violent extremes of facial expression and pose , chaotic jumble of bodies , lack of compositional structure , and inexplicable , frenetic action , this extraordinary painting images madness by subverting the Neoclassical celebration of the nude male form . Given this violation of accepted academic practices , it is not surprising that Goya requested the intervention of Bernardo de Iriarte , vice-protector of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando , in presenting the cabinet pictures to his fellow academicians . Whether the artist 's peers ever saw the Yard with Lunatics , which was still in Goya 's possession when the other works were shown on January 5 , 1794 , remains unknown . It is hard to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not shock them . The artist 's claim in one of his letters to Iriarte that the painting depicts a scene that he had actually witnessed might be read as an attempt to account for its transgression of academic standards by suggesting that it was created according to a set of artistic precepts founded on direct observation rather than idealized imitation. ( n68 ) Imitation and the Expressive Body <p> It is not unreasonable to imagine that an educated viewer -- one more learned than the mother described by Silva -- would have approached Goya 's impenitent man in relation to other depictions of suffering bodies . After all , the 1780s were a time of growing awareness in Spain regarding artistic tradition . In addition to Antonio Ponz 's Viaje de Espana , another important undertaking to make known the glories of Spanish art was the Compania para el Grabado de los Cuadros de los Reales Palacios , an organization established in 1789 to create and disseminate prints of important paintings in the royal collection. ( n69 ) The etchings that Goya made in 1778 after works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered part of this awakening of art historical consciousness , which is reflected in discussions of the art of the past in the orations delivered to the Royal Academy in Madrid. ( n70 ) Against this background , the body of the dying sinner might bring to mind the martyrs found in seventeenth-century Spanish painting , in which physical evidence of torture testifies to a saint 's faith . A work such as Jusepe de Ribera 's Martyrdom of Saint Philip of 1639 ( Fig. 14 ) provides a heuristically useful comparison -- in terms of both similarities and differences -- for the tormented body in Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent. ( n71 ) In both of these canvases , the nude male form provides a site on which to inscribe physical torment and , thus , through which to indicate the internal , mental anguish that it induces . <p> Eighteenth-century analyses of Ribera 's work emphasize the same kind of observational veracity and exacting naturalism that Silva admires in Goya 's picture , with Palomino setting the tone for subsequent authors in El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devout subjects as much as he liked expressing horrifying and harsh things , such as the bodies of old men : dry , wrinkled , and lean , with gaunt and withered faces , everything done accurately after the model with extraordinary skill , vigor , and elegant technique . " ( n72 ) Mengs provides a similar estimation in his letter to Ponz on the Spanish royal collection , describing Ribera as " admirable in the imitation of the natural , the force of his chiaroscuro and the handling of his brushes , as well as in demonstrating the accidents of the body , such as wrinkles , hair , etc. " ( n73 ) This evaluation conforms to the artistic mode that Mengs describes elsewhere in the text as the " naturalistic style , " and which was exemplified by Velazquez . Thus , from the standpoint of the selective imitation advocated by Mengs and his Spanish followers , Ribera 's painstaking representation of unimproved nature would be seen as indicative of a certain skill , but as pushing the limits of acceptability. ( n74 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1772 , one suspects that he would have agreed with Mengs 's assessment of Ribera . By contrast , the emphasis on naturalism in his 1795 analysis of Goya 's canvas indicates a dramatic change in outlook , revealing a shift in the theoretical underpinnings of his thought . In contrast to the idealist , Neoplatonic attitude , indebted to Mengs , that had animated Silva 's earlier text , the 1795 oration to the Valencia academy relies on a sensory-based epistemology to explore the issue of imitation . This transformation reflects the significant impact that sensationalism exercised on Spanish aesthetic thought ( as well as on many other fields of inquiry ) during the 1780s and 1790s. ( n75 ) Its influence is most evident in Esteban de Arteaga 's Investigaciones filosoficas sobre la belleza ideal , published in 1789 . In the course of his treatise Arteaga indicates the two most important sources for sensationalist concepts in the eighteenth century , as well as the important implications of this epistemology for the artist : <p> There is no idea or concept in the mind , however spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either directly or indirectly , have its origin in the senses , as Locke and Condillac , among others , have demonstrated ; and therefore there is no object that can not be invested with a corporeal image , and by consequence that is not capable of being imitated more or less perfectly. ( n76 ) <p> In his address of 1795 , de Silva alludes not to Locke and Condillac , but rather to the classical source of their ideas , stating that since the time of Aristotle it has been recognized that " the human understanding forms its concepts from no materials other than those that it has received through the senses " ( 26 ) . Thus , " the most original compositions ... are nothing more than ingenious combinations of particular ideas , each received through the doors of the senses .... " ( 27 ) . From this premise follows his assertion that the representation of internal mental states depends on the careful observation of nature : <p> In order to express the passions , the painter needs a reflexive understanding of all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the different modifications of these effects according to the complexion , age , climate , and other individual circumstances of the subject in which they reside ( 31 ) . <p> In this passage , the high degree of detail and the emphasis on the entire body differ from the generalized formulas of Le Brun and reflects the importance placed on the study of anatomy as a central component of artistic training in Spain at this time . Anatomy was viewed as one of the auxiliary sciences ( together with geometry and perspective ) on which artistic education should be founded . Under the influence of Mengs , Felipe de Castro , director of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando , called for the creation of chairs in these disciplines in 1763. ( n77 ) The reexamination of artistic training that took place in the academy during the 1790s reaffirmed the pedagogical value of anatomy . The engraver Juan Adan stressed the significance of its study in his report on education , pointing to the need for " a treatise on anatomy with an exact symmetry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetry and proportion of the body was also underscored in the report given by Manuel Salvador Carmona . Moreover , at a special meeting , held in August 1792 , vice-protector Bernardo de Iriarte had emphasized the importance of " a suitable number of good drawings of all parts of the human body and of academies or complete bodies . " ( n79 ) <p> Before the late 1780s , however , discussions of the painstaking study of the human body were balanced by invocations of classical statuary as a normative standard to guide artists away from the accidents of nature and toward the creation of ideal beauty . To this end , the Madrid Academy owned casts after the most famous antique works , and it should come as no surprise that in 1768 Mengs had been entrusted with the task of obtaining these objects . Eventually , at the suggestion of Pedro de Silva , the academy decided in 1773 to acquire Mengs 's own renowned collection of plaster casts. ( n80 ) Of course , travel to Italy offered another avenue by which the aspiring artist could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Goya 's notebook recording his experiences in Italy in the early 1770s reveals the importance of the classical in his own artistic formation. ( n81 ) But his report on education , delivered together with those of other professors and advisers at a special session of the Madrid academy on October 14 , 1792 , suggests a change in outlook , for it includes a vehement attack on artists who use antique prototypes as pedagogical tools : <p> What a scandal to hear nature deprecated in comparison to Greek statues by one who knows neither the one , nor the other , without acknowledging that the smallest part of Nature confounds and amazes those who know most ! What statue , or cast of it might there be , that is not copied from Divine Nature ? As excellent as the artist may be who copied it , can he not but proclaim that placed at its side , one is the work of God , and the other of our miserable hands ? He who wishes to distance himself , to correct nature without seeking the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and monotonous manner , of paintings , of plaster models , as has happened to all who have done this exactly ? ( n82 ) <p> Elsewhere in this text Goya speaks about the imitation of nature in terms that suggest the impact of sensationalism : " What a profound and impenetrable arcanum is encompassed in the imitation of divine nature , without which there is nothing good , not only in Painting ( that has no other task than its exact imitation ) but in the other sciences . " <p> Goya 's emphasis on visual observation at the expense of received models is echoed not by his fellow artists , who by and large remained under the spell of Mengsian classicism , but rather by the advisers to the Madrid academy . The latter group frequently expounded sensationalist views in the prize-giving orations presented during the 1790s . In 1796 , for example , the count of Teba asserts : <p> The Artist who adheres to the servile imitation of antique models , as many do as well as teach , will not be more than a miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copying , will have learned some form by heart . I say that the principal model of the Artist is nature , that if he studies it he could achieve invention and know the beauty that exists in it , and by this route he could come to be a master. ( n83 ) <p> Sensationalism had significant implications not just for the means by which the artist creates a work of art but also for the character of the viewer 's response to it . These ramifications are indicated by Silva 's insistence that the effect of Goya 's painting results from the involuntary workings of the beholder 's sensory and cognitive apparatus . It is the artist 's accurate transcription of nature , as we have seen , that activates the expressive potential of the figure through an appeal to the viewer 's sense of sight . Silva was not alone in suggesting that the powerful effect of visual art resulted from the indelible impact of sensory data on human perception . In the oration at the 1799 prize-giving ceremony of the Royal Academy in Madrid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The glorious deeds , represented by painting or sculpture move us , inflame us , raise the soul , sweep us toward virtue , make us indignant toward vice , and do so with the same violence as the most persuasive , most vehement , and most demonstrative lessons of philosophy .... The instruction that enters by the doors of the senses , aside from being the most durable , accommodates itself best to the common capacity of men . The people are better served by their eyes than their minds. ( n84 ) <p> In this passage , Cabrera puts a sensationalist spin on the Neoclassical principle of the exemplum virtutis : the work of art that in representing a morally didactic theme provides a model for the spectator to emulate. ( n85 ) The Andromache Mourning Hector ( Fig. 15 ) that Jacques-Louis David executed in 1783 as his reception piece , and to which Goya 's painting is frequently compared , epitomizes the idea of representing noble actions intended to serve as a paradigm for the viewer. ( n86 ) By structuring his analysis around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvas in Valencia Cathedral , Silva relies on the familiarity of his audience with this concept . However , Goya 's painting inverts the notion of the exemplum virtutis , providing an example to be avoided rather than one to be followed . This message is transmitted by the sinner 's body , its agony signifying not the moral virtue of a fallen Trojan warrior d la David , but rather the unspeakable punishments being enacted on an impenitent man. ( n87 ) Thus , although the forms and compositions of these two works bear some resemblance , the meanings they enact are diametrically opposed . Goya 's picture also differs from the Martyrdom of Saint Philip in this way , for although Ribera 's saint offers a precedent for the representation of physical anguish , he is a figure for the viewer to admire and follow -- at least in terms of the depth of his faith . <p> The comparison with Ribera 's scene of martyrdom helps to illuminate through difference another essential aspect of Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent . Although both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation to portray torments enacted on the human body , Goya 's style in this picture is not limited to a single artistic idiom . This is most apparent in the sharp dissimilarity between the figures of Saint Francis and the sinner . In contrast to the faithful imitation of the dying man 's flesh , the saint 's form is dematerialized , with only his hands and facial features revealed to the viewer . The rest of his body -- even his feet -- is denied to our gaze by the concealing , high-necked garment that he wears . In addition , his graceful , curving gestures are juxtaposed with the rigidity of the sinner 's limbs , and the strong effects of chiaroscuro around the anguished features of the condemned man contrast with the soft , even lighting that illuminates the saint 's face . Moreover , close inspection reveals that the application of paint differs between the two figures , with the face of the sinner having been handled more loosely . Thus , the painting operates through the juxtaposition of two types of imitation : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saint Francis Borgia. ( n88 ) This contrast enacts formally and stylistically the psychological and spiritual struggle between these figures , giving visual form to the conflict between body and spirit . <p> This line of analysis can be extended a step further , since the demonic creatures lurking in the background conform to yet a third imitative principle that is examined in contemporary aesthetic writing . Although Silva passes over these figures in his analysis of Goya 's painting , in the course of his remarks he touches briefly on the depiction of monsters , referring the audience to his discussion of them in his address before the Madrid academy in 1772 , from which we might surmise that his opinion on this topic has not changed . In the earlier text , Silva argues that the artist creates even monsters through the imitation of nature . Citing the strange beast described by the Roman poet Horace in the opening section of his Ars poetica , Silva argues that such creatures are absurd compilations of elements found in nature. ( n89 ) Thus , monsters result from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the artist takes forms that exist independently in nature and fuses them into anomalous combinations that are strange and unsettling rather than beautiful . As Silva states in his address of 1772 : " The same objects that delight us when they are copied are also .. , the origin of monsters .

More broadly ( and speculatively ) , one might argue that in bringing together these three competing conceptions of imitation , Goya 's image presents in microcosmic form a set of conflicts -- between classicism and realism , between realism and the imaginary -- that would play themselves out in European art over the course of the next century . <p> 
@@4000941 The expression " sent up the river " finds its roots in New York penal history . From the early 1800s on , convicted felons from New York City were literally " sent up the river " to Sing Sing , the gloomy penitentiary perched above the banks of the Hudson River at Ossining . <p> My arrival there was July 17 , 1985 , after receiving a fifteen years to life sentence under New York state 's Rockefeller drug laws . To my eyes , when the transport bus stopped in front of the gates , the view of the river was awesome , spreading out from the prison like a smooth , still carpet . The contrast of the natural beauty of the surroundings and the daunting facade of Sing Sing was mind-boggling . Then , once inside , as the bus inched past the giant concrete wall , I looked up and saw gun towers with armed guards . Seagulls circled high above , giving the prison the look of a medieval castle . <p> In the heart of the prison complex was the state shop , where new jacks ( prison speak for new inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me on the bus , were taken off and steered like cattle into a holding pen . Our cuffs and chains were removed and , one by one , we were called to another room where we were reunited with our property and given our cell assignments . <p> I was assigned to B Block . With some 660 prisoners , this is reputed to be the world 's largest cellblock . To get there we had to travel past other parts of the prison . Long , concrete corridors and tunnels connected Sing Sing 's many buildings , most of which were in horrendous condition . Slabs of peeling paint hung from the ceilings . A thin film of moisture , residue from the nearby river , covered the battleship-gray walls . The smell of mildew , disinfectant , and body odor from the 2,300 men who filled the prison made me nauseated . <p> At several checkpoints along the way we stopped while guards known as turnkeys opened the steel gates that were strategically placed throughout the facility . Prisoners could n't travel beyond these checkpoints without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 yards and countless steel gates later a door swung open and I took my first steps into B Block . <p> The noise hit me like a freight train . Rap music from radios hanging on cell bars blasted throughout the tiers . Prisoners shouted at one another from across the rows of cages stacked one on top of another , four stories high . The voices of hundreds of convicts ricocheted off the steel bars , creating a thunderous din . The block resembled a giant airplane hangar full of human cargo . <p> While I stood there , stunned , another set of gates opened . A guard led us to a cell that had been converted into an office for the officer in charge . This OIC ran the daffy activities of the block and attended to the custodial upkeep of the prisoners who lived there . I was astonished by the enormity of his task . As I gazed out over the tiers , I saw prisoners running buck wild up and down the corridors , hanging out in each other 's cells , shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy , raucous , and crowded . <p> The cell I was assigned was a windowless , fifty-four square foot solid metal cube , number W-429 . It contained a small bed with steel springs and a torn , piss-stained mattress . A toilet with an old , porcelain bowl squatted in the corner next to a small metal locker . A portable lamp with a built-in electrical outlet was clamped over the bed . Graffiti covered the walls . I threw my property sack on the floor , sat on the bed , which was more like a cot , and held my head in my hands to drown out the noise . <p> Shortly after , a guard cracked the cell gates , signaling it was time for lunch . I followed a group of prisoners to the mess hall and took my position in line . This place was as loud and confusing as the cellblock . Hundreds of prisoners , some eating , some leaving , some standing in line , filled the massive , high-ceilinged room . At one point I made the mistake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , motherfucker ! " he screamed in my face . " What 's wrong with you ? Do n't ever reach over my food again or I 'll kill you . " <p> I backed away and apologized . I learned quickly that this gesture , like so many others in prison , was a sign of disrespect . The subculture there carried its own set of rules , known as the " convict code , " which prisoners lived and died by . The best that a new jack could do was to learn the code as quickly as possible and pray that in the meantime his rookie mistakes would n't get him murdered . <p> One of the worst parts about life as a new jack was being checked out by all the other prisoners . Not having a crew was dangerous . The prison was infested with predators and scam artists searching for men who had n't hooked up with a gang for protection . B Block was more dangerous than the other blocks because it was a transit-housing unit . Prisoners were constantly coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be moving out so they lived for the moment , not caring about anything or anyone . <p> The way for a new jack to protect himself was to join a crew and find safety in numbers . Some inmates joined racial gangs for protection , but you could find just about any kind of group to hang with to show that you were n't doing time solo . You 'd start by playing basketball or handball with someone , then meeting his friends . If they liked you , you became " one of the crew . " <p> I found a crew by pumping iron with two older Puerto Ricans . After we 'd worked out together a couple of times , Roberto , who was doing twenty-five years for murder , took me under his wing and showed me the ropes . He told me that it was important to always have a weapon handy in case something went down . I said I was n't looking for trouble . " It does n't matter , " he said . " Trouble has a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later that day , we were hanging out in my cell when Roberto opened his green army jacket . From the inside pocket he removed a shank -- a six-inch sharpened piece of metal with the end wrapped in black electrical tape . He offered it to me . <p> " No , Roberto , I do n't want that . " <p> " Do n't be stupid , Tony . You got ta have something . " He looked at my locker and reached for a small box full of batteries . He snatched my laundry bag and pulled out a sweat sock . " Perfect , " he said , loading the sock with a handful of batteries and knotting the end . It became an instant blackjack . " You can use socks for a lot of different things , " he said , " from brewing coffee to smashing someone 's skull . " He placed a boot on my bed and demonstrated , raising the lethal sock over his shoulder and smashing it down on the boot . " One good crack and that motherfucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many heads like this , and cracked many nuts , too , " he laughed . <p> " Nuts ? " <p> " Not the kind you eat . The kind you get when you 're backed up . " <p> " Backed up ? " His explanations were starting to confuse me . <p> " Yeah , backed up because you got no pussy . " He reached for the jar of Vaseline in my locker . Instinctively my fists clenched and I looked around for a guard . Roberto grabbed another sock from my bag and filled the inside with a scoop of Vaseline . " Here , " he said , handing me the sock . " When you get lonely , all you got to do is stick your dick inside and you 'll be all right . " <p> I looked at the sock and tried to imagine fucking it . " I do n't think so , " I said shaking my head in disbelief . <p> " Look , " he said angrily . " You 'll do a lot of things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a decade and have fifteen more to go ! " He was yelling now ; the veins in his neck bulged . " I did shit even I could n't believe but I had to in order to survive . Doing time will change you -- face it . " He calmed down when he saw the look on my face . He could tell his sermon rattled me . " Just keep an open mind , Tony . It 's the only way to beat all this time you got ta do . " <p> I 'd never thought about time and its consequences . In the street , " time " was a relative concept , flowing in and out like the tide . Sometimes you had more , sometimes less . Here , it controlled you , grabbed you by the throat and made you hyperaware of your existence . Roberto spent many hours educating me about doing time . His lessons probably saved my life . <p> One day , he asked me if I 'd do his laundry for him . " Sure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waved a finger in my face . " You never do nobody 's laundry . " Doing someone 's laundry was the first step toward becoming his punk , he said . <p> I remained on good terms with Roberto and his Latino crew but , despite having a crew , danger still existed . Much of the danger was brought on by drugs . Sing Sing was awash in them . And where there are drugs , there 's violence . Different crews would fight each other over distribution turf . I tried to keep a low profile but learned that what Roberto had said was true : trouble has a way of finding you in prison , whether you 're looking for it or not . To survive in this environment I had to become comfortable with violence . I was n't a violent person on the outside , but I learned that violence was deeply imbedded in the prison culture , where the strong preyed on the weak . Either you defended yourself or you were victimized , plain and simple . It could start innocently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young blond-headed guy complimented me on my sunglasses . I made the mistake of letting him try them on . A week later I was walking through the block when I ran into the same guy .

He took a broken , rusty razor blade out of his pocket and waved it in front of my face . " I want those sunglasses , motherfucker , " he said . Because I 'd let him try on my sunglasses , he figured I was easy prey and now he was testing me . <p> My friend Roberto had taught me to look at the size of the weapon before reacting . As a rule of thumb , if the weapon was n't deadly , you should fight back at all costs . If you did n't , word spread that you were a coward , which meant that your ass would be on the line with others . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run but always return with an equal-sized weapon . <p> I looked at the razor blade . It was less than an inch long . It could n't kill me , I figured . I made my choice and looked square into the guy 's face . I was ready to fight because I knew that my survival at Sing Sing depended on it . If I let him take my glasses , I 'd be pegged a pussy . The predators would find out and make my life more hellish than it already was . " Use that , " I growled , " and I 'll kill you . " I stared him down with pure hatred in my eyes , thinking about how I 'd fucked up my entire life , lost my family , and now I 'd be spending my best fifteen years in this rat hole . The piece-of-crap con must have seen the fire in my eyes and everything that was behind it . He quickly put away the blade and tried to make a joke out of it . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that I could get out of most situations simply by feigning toughness , or " fronting , " as prisoners say , putting on a certain face or using certain words and speaking with absolute conviction . There were times , however , when violence was unavoidable . Often it boiled down to being in the wrong place at the wrong time . <p> One day I was walking the flats , the ground-level area of the block , when I saw this guy Nicky whom I knew from the weight room . At 6 ' 2 ? and 240 pounds of solid muscle , Nicky was a monster . The week before , he 'd noticed my sneakers and asked me what size they were . " Ten , " I said . Funny , he wore the same size , too . Since I 'd once seen Nicky whack a guy over the head with a forty-pound dumbbell just for looking at him the wrong way , I figured it 'd be a good idea to get on his good side . I told him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair . He 'd nodded and thanked me . <p> The next day , Nicky spotted me at the rear of the cellblock and motioned me over to him . As I got closer I noticed that his face wore a strange expression and his eyes were bloodshot . From his breath I could tell he was drunk on jailhouse wine . " Give me your sneakers , " he demanded . <p> " I did n't get my new ones yet , " I said . <p> " You think I give a shift ? " Before I could answer , he unleashed a powerful upper cut that caught me square under my chin . I sailed backwards to the floor -- and my sneakers came off ! He hit me so hard I literally flew out of my sneakers . To this day , I do n't know whether they 'd been untied and flew off from the impact or if he 'd knocked me unconscious long enough to yank them off my feet . Whatever the case , shortly after hitting the floor , I popped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to forget about it . No one wanted to start trouble with a guy like Nicky . Besides , people said he went crazy every so often , usually when he was high or drunk . If I left it alone , Nicky would be fine with me , they said . It was good prison politics . <p> Sure enough , the advice was sound . The next day in the weight room Nicky acted like nothing had happened . " Hey Tony , what 's going on ? " he said , slapping me on the back and flashing a smile . " Thanks for the sneakers , " he said . I noticed that he was wearing them . <p> " Hey , all right , " I replied . " They fit okay ? " <p> " Sure do , man , thanks again . " <p> It was good to have guys like Nicky on your side . <p> About six months into my stay I tried to get a job as an electrician in the prison . Getting assigned to certain jobs could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facility needed . And this would get me transferred to A Block , the main housing area . After that , I would n't have to worry about being shipped out to a possibly worse facility elsewhere in the state . <p> I went to the chapel where the administration had set up a committee to assign qualified prisoners to work assignments . I approached a counselor and said I 'd like to work as an electrician . I said I had skills to offer Sing Sing and that I wanted to spend my time doing something constructive , something that could get me a job in the real world once I got out . <p> " Look everyone , " the counselor called out . " This man wants to be rehabilitated ! " He doubled over in laughter . <p> I looked at his pudgy face , red with glee , and I thought of everything I 'd gone through to get to this sorry place , how I was standing there like a fool , begging for a job that paid pennies . This time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what about it ? " I shot back , not bothering to disguise the hostility in my voice . " I know lots of guys in here who want to improve themselves .

" You mean to tell me that your job amounts to nothing more than locking people up ? You do n't believe in giving prisoners a chance to do something constructive with their time ? " <p> He did n't respond . I knew I should 've kept my mouth shut , but I was sick of the crap . All the prison was good for was warehousing men , infantilizing them , and then churning them out like so many widgets on the day of their release . I stepped closer to read his nametag . " Mr. Cody , " it said . He was a civilian employee , not a cop . Fuck it , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know , Mr. Cody , " I said , enunciating both syllables in his name .

I got a family to support . I could really use a job . " <p> " I do n't have a job for you , " he said , his voice rising . " Now get out ! " <p> As I left , a counselor sitting in the rear of the chapel got up and walked out with me . He introduced himself as Dennis Manwaring , the Special Subjects Supervisor .

@@4080241 Gender-based violence ( GBV ) affects women across race , ethnicity , age , socioeconomic status , religion , sexual orientation , and geographic boundaries . No segments of society are immune from the vestiges of this problem . Yet GBV has been particularly harmful within communities of African ancestry African American communities suffer with greater lethality and more severe injuries than other racial and ethnic groups as a result of GBV . Despite this , there are limited culturally based services available to assist this population . The black experience-based social work ( BEBSW ) perspective , developed by Elmer and Joanne Martin , offers a framework that can be applied with black communities to address GBV . The central themes of BEBSW , which are separation and loss , are applied to considering strategies to address GBV within the African American community .

GBV includes childhood sexual abuse , " prenatal sex selection in favor of boys , female infanticide , dowry deaths , honour killings , female genital mutilation , trafficking and forced prostitution , forced early marriage , sexual assault and intimate partner violence " ( Renzetti , 2005 , p. 1009 ) . Although GBV is a critical problem within communities of color , limited culturally competent interventions are available to address this issue . The black experience-based social work ( BEBSW ) perspective , as discussed by Martin and Martin ( 1995 ) , offers a culturally based framework that can be applied within black communities . The central themes of BEBSW are separation and loss and are explained by using the three concepts : moaning , mourning , and morning . The purpose of this article is to explore how BEBSW can be applied to finding solutions for GBV among African American women . SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM Although this article discusses GBV solutions for African American women , it is important to contextualize the problem of GBV . It is estimated that one out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellsberg , 2006 ; Stevens , 2001 ) . In a World Health Organization study on women 's health and domestic violence within 10 countries , physical violence , sexual violence , or both existed among 15 percent to 71 percent of the women ( Garcia-Moreno , Jasen , Ellsberg , Helse , &; Watts , 2005 ) . In another multicountry study on domestic violence , between 21 percent and 58 percent of the women surveyed experienced physical and sexual violence in their lifetime , and between 17 percent and 48 percent of these women experienced the same type of violence at the hands of an intimate partner ( Kishor &; Kiersten , 2004 ) . Intimate partner violence ( IPV ) is the most common of these types of violence . In a review of 70 population-based studies , the rate of IPV among women was between 10 percent and 60 percent ( Ellsberg , 2006 ) . In country after country , the statistics are staggering : Nearly 50 percent of women in Bangladesh have experienced IPV from a male partner ; 80 percent of women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 83 seconds , a woman is raped in South Africa , with only 20 percent of these women reporting the case to police annually ( Family Violence Prevention Fund , 2007 ; Pan American Health Organization , 2005 ) . The United States is not exempt from these forms of violence . More than 30 percent of U.S. women have reported experiencing physical or sexual abuse by a husband or boyfriend each year ( Commonwealth Fund , 1999 ) , with estimates as high as 5 million U.S. women experiencing domestic violence each year ( National Center for Injury Prevention and Control , 2003 ) . African American women have been particularly vulnerable to more lethal forms of violence and greater severity of violence than other groups of women ( Bent-Goodley , 2001 ; T. West , 1999 ) . Women of color face increased barriers to treatment and are less likely to obtain services that are culturally responsive and , hence , more targeted at the social and cultural contexts in which they live ( Bent-Goodley , 2005b ; Sokoloff &; Pratt , 2005 ) . African American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the home and become incarcerated under mandatory arrest laws compared with women from other ethnic groups ( Bent-Goodley , 2005b ) . African American women are more likely to be resistant to receiving services for fear of being treated poorly or misunderstood by the practitioner ( Bent-Goodley , 2004 ; T. West , 1999 ) . They have also experienced discriminatory treatment ; for example , African American women have been turned away from services , arrested , and prosecuted because of negative stereotypes ( Bent-Goodley , 2005b ; T. West , 1999 ) . Increasingly , GBV has been acknowledged as a serious reproductive , sexual , psychosocial , and public health issue for women . Women who have experienced GBV have been more likely to experience poorer health , chronic pain , memory loss , spontaneous and induced abortion , and greater abuse during pregnancy ( Campbell , 2002 ; Women 's International Network News , 2003 ) . The connection between GBV and HIV has also received increasing attention as the rates of HIV are soaring in communities of African ancestry around the world ( Bent-Goodley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate condom usage , can interfere with her ability to obtain needed medical or drug treatment , and can place her at risk of violence if it is determined that she has HIV/AIDS ( Decker , Silverman &; Raj , 2005 ; Garcia-Moreno &; Watts , 2000 ; Go et al. , 2003 ; Maman , Campbell , Sweat , &; Gielen , 2000 ) . Having a history of forced sex places women and girls at an even greater risk of contracting HIV/ AIDS ( Andersson et al. , 2004 ; Dunkle et al. , 2004 ; Fullilove et al. , 1993 ; Wyatt et al. , 2002 ) . Finding solutions to this problem must include a culturally based approach . Cultural Responses to GBV Because GBV touches the lives of people from such diverse cultures , it requires a culturally based approach . The different social and cultural contexts are critical to developing responses that are effective and make sense to the particular population ( Duffy , 2005 ; Jones et al. , 2001 ) . Women of color have acknowledged the importance of looking not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also at how they intersect to make women even more vulnerable to violence and other forms of oppression ( Bent-Goodley , 2005b ; Guedes , Bott , &; Cuca , 2002 ; Sokoloff &; Pratt , 2005 ; van der Hoogte &; Kingma , 2004 ) . As such , stereotypes of women of color , lack of trust of outsiders and public officials , and fear of reporting due to the potential for discriminatory treatment and further violence are all reasons that women of color have given for why services should be culturally grounded and based on the recommendations of women in the community . Interventions should be holistic and should not just focus on the individual ; they should include an emphasis on the pervasive social ills , formidable health challenges , social and economic inequities , community perceptions , and social hierarchies that perpetuate these issues . Those in the international community , particularly women of color , have already begun the process of developing initiatives targeting GBV ( Guedes , 2004 ; Melendez , Hoffman , Exner , Leu , &; Ehrhardt , 2003 ; O'Hara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2001 ) . However , similar initiatives within the United States have been limited . This article offers one conceptualization of how to use a culturally based approach to address domestic violence in the African American community . BLACK EXPERIENCE-BASED SOCIAL WORK ( BEBSW ) There are strengths among African Americans that can be used to respond to domestic violence . The BEBSW approach builds on these strengths ( Bent-Goodley , 2005a ; Carlton-LaNey , 2001 ; Graham , 2000 ; Harvey , 2001 ; Martin &; Martin , 2002 ; Myers , 1988 ; Schiele , 2000 ) . BEBSW stands out as one way of addressing this complex issue through a culturally based approach . Using this approach does not dishonor the great variation and diversity of historical and contemporary experiences within the African American community , but , instead , builds on the notion of connectedness that still exists within this rich culture . BEBSW " drawls from a social work emphasis on black experiences , black values , black perspectives , and black methods of problem solving " ( Martin &; Martin , 1995 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Africa , slavery , and rural life after emancipation ... had their own ways of identifying problems and their own tools of intervention " ( p. 12 ) . African Americans have developed effective mechanisms to address social and community problems . BEBSW allows providers to build on that tradition . Martin and Martin ( 1995 ) argued that at the heart of many social problems in the black community is the struggle to deal with being separated from and losing family and friends . As a result , the three major concepts of BEBSW are moaning , mourning , and morning : " a linear progression from suffering ( moaning ) to collective healing and support ( mourning ) and finally toward an ideal state of health , happiness , and transformation ( morning ) " ( pp. 15-16 ) . Each concept is centered on the problem of separation and loss and the associated historical and contemporary trauma . Concept One : Moaning Moaning " refers to black pain , suffering and grief . Through moanin ' , or crying or shouting out , black people sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its reality " ( Martin &; Martin , 1995 , p. 15 ) . Social workers are encouraged to focus on the problem of separation and loss and its associated trauma during this point of engagement in the helping relationship . Assessment is a part of this phase , as the social worker is required to assess the presenting issues and determine the nature of the problem . Essential to this concept is understanding that the survival of black people has largely rested on the ability to mask the problem . Building from historical and contemporary examples , Martin and Martin ( 1995 ) suggested that three major challenges to problem definition and assessment are ( 1 ) being able to see beyond the mask , ( 2 ) developing a trusting helping relationship , and ( 3 ) continuing use of inadequate assessment tools that do not consider cultural influences and strengths that can aid in the assessment process . In application , Martin and Martin ( 1995 ) emphasized the importance of using different assessment tools to ascertain what has happened and what is happening and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for diverse tools of assessment that not only identify what is happening now , but also assess cultural history and how it applies to the current dilemma . The assessment process should not be limited to the individual and the present situation , but should also include an examination of the larger collective and historical context that could ' shape the individual 's experiences , circumstances , interpretations , and perceptions of the situation ( Carlton-LaNey , 2001 ; Franklin , 2000 ; Hill , 1999 ) . Using a BEBSW approach to assess GBV , its presence and severity , one must consider the nature of the helping relationship and how GBV is identified . A practitioner must work to develop trust with a woman before expecting the woman to divulge personal information that may , in her mind , have implications for herself , her family , and her community ( Bent-Goodley , 2005a ; Boyd-Franklin , 2006 ) . It is also critical to recognize that , as part of surviving the situation , past experiences , and the contemporary reality of her situation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin &; Martin , 1995 ) . Without understanding the need to use the mask , the practitioner could incorrectly assess the problem or become unwilling to work with the woman because she is being perceived as resistant , defiant , or unpleasant to engage . In addition , some black women may not be perceived as needing help because their masks may not demonstrate a high risk to the worker . It is critical to identify the use of the mask and then figure out how it can be used to address the situation at hand . Finally , assessment tools and protocols are often ill-prepared to deal with these complex issues and realities . Current assessment tools and protocols often require that women share " the problem " within a specified timeline ( Boyd-Franklin , 2006 ) . Without respect for the sensitivity of the information being sought and the need to develop trust and a working relationship to ask the question , the process can then fuel the woman 's sense of mistrust because it could appear that the system is ill-equipped to deal with the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2005a ) . In addition , the assessment could be faulty , incomplete , or both , diminishing the effectiveness of the assessment . Tools that include a focus on cultural influences and strengths are needed to create more informed and more accurate assessments ( Boyd-Franklin , 2006 ; Hill , 1999 ) . However , there are other issues of assessment to consider . How and when questions are asked is worthy of greater attention . It is insufficient to expect that a woman of color will divulge GBV within the context of living in a racist , sexist , and oppressive environment without considering the potential risks ( Bent-Goodley , 2004 ) . Assessment must take place within this context . There should be more time to develop the relationship ( Boyd-Franklin , 2006 ) . Other assessment strategies should include an honest discussion of issues of race and discrimination and their impact on the helping relationship and the perception of the situation ( C. West , 2003 ) . Assessment should also include an acknowledgment of stereotypes that affect a woman 's experiences and her perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The practitioner may find that the woman may not say how she truly feels to be socially acceptable or to not offend the practitioner . This decision can affect the flow and accuracy of communication and inhibit obtaining critical information . Finally , issues of separation and loss should also be discussed to not just include individuals lost through death , but also individuals lost through other means , such as abandonment ( Brice , 1999 ; Rosenblatt &; Wallace , 2005 ) . Concept Two : Mourning Mourning " pertains to a collective effort to overcome grief and involves a collective process of identification , empathy , and catharsis " ( Martin &; Martin , 1995 , p. 15 ) . The mourning concept encompasses the problem-solving process and focuses on collective healing in the black community . The mourning process addresses the problem of hopelessness by providing relief and instilling hope among individuals and the larger community . Part of diminishing the secrecy and shame associated with GBV is helping those within the community to understand the concept of vulnerability , which is the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and oppression ( Hill , 1999 ; Martin &; Martin , 1995 ; Schiele , 2000 ) . Finally , there is the idea that there are hidden injuries of race that often are not apparent but are present in each human interaction . Consequently , the color-blind approach counters effectively meeting the needs of the individual and the community ( Bent-Goodley , 2005b ; Gondolf &; Williams , 2001 ) . The hidden injuries of race result in many African Americans feeling suspicion when working with formal service providers . The client may be reserved about sharing personal experiences and pain because of fear of being further isolated or viewed negatively by the practitioner ( Boyd-Franklin , 2006 ) . These types of issues can become so challenging that many African American clients try to ignore racial issues for fear of rejection , lack of validation , and further alienation . The cumulative effect of these components is the inability to mourn . Mourning is critical , as it represents a time when the person can be reaffirmed , where the problem can be reexamined and redefined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , address the problem , and eventually heal ( Martin &; Martin , 1995 ) . Without the ability to mourn , the person might feel a profound and staggering sense of hopelessness and emotional vulnerability . In application , Martin and Martin ( 2005 ) stressed that the goal of the mourning process is cultural versatility , not social adaptation . The social worker is encouraged to examine the problem of loss , separation and trauma , and the historical and economic nature of the individual 's problems ( Brice , 1999 ; Rosenblatt &; Wallace , 2005 ) , with an emphasis on a collective approach , to include informal networks and mutual aid groups . The social worker is encouraged to help the client recognize barriers , to facilitate a collective approach , and to bring individual pain to the surface so that there can be a collective reaffirmation , reexamination of the problem , and redefining of the issues . Ultimately , the social worker is helping to instill hope by earning the client 's trust and showing evidence of an emotional commitment to the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The social worker is called to ensure that the intervention is culturally relevant , addresses issues of separation and loss , and helps to instill hope within the individual and the community ( Martin &; Martin , 1995 ) . The mourning process reminds us that there can not be a color-blind approach to addressing GBV . It is insufficient to think that all black women experience GBV in the same way . Instead , the approach must respect the diversity among black women both as an ethnic group and as individuals , acknowledging that there may be central experiences and strengths within the black experience that lend themselves to intervention ( Bent-Goodley , 2005b ; T. West , 1999 ) . Cultural relevance , in this context , would incorporate the use of mutual aid groups and informal systems into the intervention . Social workers can work with community- and faith-based organizations to develop creative solutions and mechanisms to address GBV ( Bent-Goodley &; Fowler , 2006 ) . They can also support indigenous practices and help to validate those practices that have been developed in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being culturally relevant is bigger than having pictures of African Americans on the walls or having frontline African American staff . Cultural relevance includes furthering the advancement of people of color who understand culturally specific practice and the cultural context , in senior administrative and board roles , and creating administrative policies that respect the culture . In short , people of color should be represented within the full spectrum of decision making , with policies and programs to foster an environment open to diversity and change ( Bent-Goodley , 2005b ) . Having people of color in leadership roles does not mean that they are the only ones capable of providing such services . All practitioners , regardless of race , ethnicity , or role in an agency , should be held accountable for providing services that are culturally relevant to the population being served . Because separation and loss are central to understanding BEBSW , grief therapy is an essential component that can be used to address the problem . Grief therapy and the mourning process must acknowledge and incorporate cultural influences , reflect an understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build on cultural strengths ( Rosenblatt &; Wallace , 2005 ) . The woman could be grieving the loss of a relationship , companionship , or having another person to help with parenting . Although the woman wants the violence to stop , she could also feel a loss , nonetheless , from an emotional and economic standpoint . It is important to acknowledge this separation and loss within the context of the cultural and historical experience . In addition , many black women choose not to talk about the violence they have experienced for fear of bringing shame to the family and community , because they do not want " everyone in their business , " or to protect the man ( Bent-Goodley , 2001 ; C. West , 2003 ; T. West , 1999 ) . It should be understood and relayed that there are cultural dynamics associated with grief and mourning ( Brice , 1999 ; Moore &; Bryant , 2003 ; Rosenblatt &; Wallace , 2005 ) . There are also cultural strengths and tools associated with addressing issues of separation and loss that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that she can heal in the future . Culturally based grief therapy must address all types of separation and loss , including non-death loss , from a cultural perspective . There is a cultural perspective to addressing separation and loss that is unique for African Americans and " often entangled with issues of racism and discrimination " ( Rosenblatt &; Wallace , 2005 , p. 168 ) . This cultural perspective " refers to distinctively African American music , religious institutions , community life , values , culturally meaningful historical events and processes , foods , historically important and contemporary leaders , writings and much else " ( Rosenblatt &; Wallace , 2005 , p. 168 ) . It is vital to find ways to instill hope . Although a practitioner does not want to instill false hope , it is difficult for him or her to help people believe in the possibility of change if they do not see a part of the practitioner 's role as instilling hope . To instill hope , it is necessary to influence those systems that stifle hope . It is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To instill hope , one must have a vision , something to work toward that transcends the situation and points to a brighter future . To instill hope , one must be prepared to engage those systems that challenge the growth and potential of those who are oppressed . The social worker 's role is to instill hope for the individual and the community . Instilling hope does not mean that the worker should make promises or break professional boundaries ; instead , the worker should recognize the possibilities in a given situation . The worker then must convey this information to the client and create similar communications to the community . In addition , the practitioner is required to understand that the client empowers herself and that through the practitioner 's knowledge , skill , and enthusiasm , he or she can help the client connect or reconnect to her sense of power and potential ( Bent-Goodley , 2005a ) . Instilling hope is an important emphasis of the morning phase , and it is accomplished when the individual and collective empowerment of the group is targeted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that addressing the problem is worthy of all of us . Concept Three : Morning " Mornin ' ... represents a significant breakthrough , the arrival of a brighter day , a new beginning , a transformation , or a change " ( Martin &; Martin , 1995 , p. 15 ) . The goal of the morning concept is to strengthen the capacity of black people to face their problems and take action toward collective social , economic , and political empowerment that leads to social change . In application , the focus of the morning process is to foster the healing and growth of the community through collective empowerment . The role of the social worker is to help the client strengthen his or her sense of identity and connectedness to the community and historical legacy ( Carlton-LaNey , 2001 ; Hill , 1999 ; Schiele , 2000 ) . In addition , advocacy targeted toward social and economic change is emphasized as a means to foster the empowerment of the black community . The morning phase emphasizes the need for practitioners to invest in the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help her find ways to heal from violence . Indeed , the BEBSW approach stresses that knowledge of historical and contemporary events must translate into applied approaches to address the vestiges of generational oppression ( Bent-Goodley , 2005b ) . It is critical to include the community , as the woman defines it , through community education and organizing . This helps the community to not relegate violence against women and girls as a problem rooted in gender alone , but to also acknowledge the far-reaching impact of GBV so that it is not considered a woman 's issue only , but also a community issue ( Bent-Goodley , 2005a ; T. West , 1999 ) . The safety and protection of women and girls must be paramount , but its connection to the survival and strength of communities and nations must also be highlighted . The social worker must go beyond the individual and also serve as an advocate for policy and programmatic change on multilevels . Social workers are needed to strengthen advocacy efforts in this area and to broaden the discussion to include the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finding ways to address the intersections of oppression ( Davis &; Bent-Goodley , 2004 ) . Social workers are uniquely positioned to foster greater dialogue and efforts to address GBV as the social work profession has a focus on social and economic justice . Understanding the direct service needs of this population , social workers are intimately aware of the broad spectrum of systemic needs and challenges experienced by this population ; consequently , they can serve as optimal advocates who can illuminate issues unknown to others , more efficiently mobilize those within the population , and intently influence necessary systems to better serve this population . It is critical that the community education process take place on multiple levels . The immediate community must be engaged . If a woman is being served in a community , then community education should ensue to facilitate collective affirmation . The communal approach has been acknowledged as a key cultural strength and an opportunity for social workers to better engage and respond to issues within African American communities ( Carlton-LaNey , 2001 ; Harvey , 2001 ; Hill , 1999 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows social workers to develop sustainable responses to stopping violence within these communities . It further creates opportunities for community accountability regarding this issue . Culturally specific community education approaches are necessary to more effectively educate communities about this issue and to ensure their support in stopping the violence . These approaches must be specific to the community and recognize the residents ' diverse cultural thoughts and experiences . Community education provides a viable opportunity for social workers to fortify their response to GBV and create lasting solutions in response to this issue . CONCLUSION BEBSW provides a means of examining GBV from a culturally specific perspective and offers ways of responding to GBV . Using a black perspective , BEBSW roots the assessment , interventions , and healing from within a culturally responsive framework that posits change on multiple levels , including the individual , family , community , and societal levels . The BEBSW approach offers a framework to better understand how GBV is unique within the black experience . The approach reinforces the importance of instilling hope and addressing issues of separation and loss , both through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus on culturally specific grief and community education approaches that evidence respect and awareness of the diversity , strengths , and challenges within this population . Social workers are uniquely and irreplaceably prepared to address the problem of GBV by offering new culturally specific strategies , enhanced advocacy , and greater awareness of this issue .

@@4011041 Section : Early Entrance to College <p> This article reviews research about how students who enter college early perform academically and socially . Research results suggest that early entrants continue to achieve at high levels in college . Also , most students make the adjustment to the social scene on campus easily and have friendships with typically aged college students . Research suggests that early entrants students tend to continue on to graduate school and use the time gained from early entrance for further academic opportunities . Future research should focus on studying underachievers and the early career productivity of early entrants . The decision to enter college early is one of matching a students needs and abilities to the appropriate environment . <p> Among the options for gifted students to obtain appropriately challenging instruction is early entrance to college . Entering college before the usual age has long been used by individual students to accommodate their learning needs . ( See Brody &; Stanley , 1991 for more history on early entrance to college . ) At present , most universities and colleges ( 87% ) will accept exceptionally promising young students without a high school diploma ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Callahan , Bassin &; Ramsay , 1991 ) and some ( 16% ) will admit students of pre-high school age . But only a few universities have instituted special early entrance programs to attract and support young talent . <p> There is a need for early entrance programs . The growth of programs for gifted elementary and high school students such as the regional talent searches have resulted in many gifted students taking advanced classes early and completing the high school curriculum prior to the twelfth grade . These gifted students need and desire early access to college level work . <p> The advanced courses that are available in high school may not be appropriate in level for very gifted students . In a study done at Northwestern University on talent search participants , it was found that projected high school SAT scores for students who had the lowest scores when they took the test in the seventh or eighth grade , would meet or exceed the average scores of high school students who completed AP courses in high school ( Olszewski-Kubilius , Mockros &; Wiley , 1990 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 on the SAT at seventh or eighth grade may be ready for AP courses earlier than their junior or senior year of high school , when students typically take them . <p> Cox , Daniel and Boston ( 1985 ) found that 28% of the school districts in their nation wide study of practices in gifted education allow students to graduate from high school early . In addition , some states ( i.e. Indiana , Wisconsin , Michigan , Ohio , see Talent Development , Spring , 1993 ) have or are preparing legislation to allow high school students to simultaneously enroll in college , i.e. dual enrollment . However , most put severe restrictions on the number of college courses a student can take and/or limit this option to primarily juniors and seniors . And many , students are not able to take advantage of these options because their families often have to pay part of the college tuition and they are not eligible for financial aid . Thus , the options that are available to very bright high school aged students for early access to college courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . <p> Along with the increase in special early entrance programs and the number of early entrance students , is a body of research about the effects of early entrance . Many educators and parents are still leery of this practice as they are of other accelerative strategies ( Jones &; Southern , 1991 ) . The purpose of this article is to address some basic questions and issues about early entrance to college and to relate the research evidence regarding them . Early Entrance Programs <p> Early entrance programs are typically set up as special programs within an existing college or university . One exception to this is the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science which is structured so that Texas students concurrently complete the last two years of high school and the first two years of college . Another is Simon 's Rock which is administratively tied to Bard College but is a separate community . Students earn an Associate of Arts degree after two years and elect either to continue at the college or transfer to another institution . <p> Early entrance programs vary on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years early while others admit students after completion of the seventh or eighth grade or after one year of high school . One program is exclusively for females . Some programs are residential while others , particularly those that admit students after elementary school , require students to commute . Usually early entrance programs have special support services available for students as part of the program . But the degree of support varies , with more support provided in programs that admit younger students . Support includes special residence halls , an assigned counselor , a designated student lounge , and special social events . <p> The programs that offer the most radical acceleration provide a transition program that prepares students academically for college and during which they take some college classes . Transition programs vary in duration from several months to a year . And , there are universities that have a reputation for accepting younger students and may have substantial numbers of them , but do not have special support services for them . <p> Entrance requirements for early entrance programs vary but generally include SAT or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students ' maturity , independence , general readiness for the college environment , and family support for the program . Typically , acceptance decisions are made after a substantial amount of information has been collected on the student and his/her family . <p> Early entrance programs have been in existence for varying amounts of time . The oldest and most established has been operating for 26 years , another for 16 years , and several have developed within the past eight to ten years . The age of the program will affect the degree to which selection procedures have been refined and the available evidence about the program . These and other program characteristics can affect research findings and will be pointed out as necessary in the review of the literature . Some Caveats <p> The students who enter college early are a highly selective group . They have exceptional intellectual abilities . In addition , the fact that students are aware of the possibility of early entrance and enter these programs suggests that they have unusually interested and supportive families or teachers . Early entrants may be outstanding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confidence and maturity . Researchers may eschew the research findings reported below because of the selectivity of the samples studied . It is probably true that if a random group of academically qualified high school students were put into an early entrance program , the results of these investigations would be different . But , as Benbow ( 1991 ) points out , accelerative strategies are not for every gifted child and it is appropriate that students self select themselves into these opportunities . Self selection really entails matching a child 's needs , personality and abilities to the characteristics of a program ( Benbow , 1991 ) . Early entrance programs , especially those that offer radical acceleration ( i.e. four years or more ) , have continuously refined their selection procedures based on experiences with students to ensure that participants can do college level work and adjust socially . They try to choose students who will succeed . As Southern and Jones ( 1991 ) point out , most accelerative options , including early admission , are administrative arrangements to accommodate students who have mastered material at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually very obviously different from other students and both positive and negative findings regarding early entrants are as likely attributable to these differences as to the early entrance experience itself ( Southern &; Jones , 1991 ) . This said , the research supports that early entrance to college is an appropriate option for some gifted students . How Do Early Entrance Students Perform Academically ? <p> Under the broad question of how early entrants to college perform academically are many secondary questions including the following : Do students admitted early live up to their potential or do they earn passing but mediocre grades ? Does their academic performance suffer due to skill gaps as a result of skipping years of high school ? Do students graduate and " on time " ? Do early entrants attend less selective colleges than they would if they did not go early ? There are research findings available on each of these issues . <p> In general , the academic performance of early entrants is impressive . Early entrants earn higher grade point averages than regular freshman ( Eisenberg &; George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noble , Robinson &; Gunderson , 1993 ) , typically in the B+ to A- range ( Stanley &; McGill , 1986 ; Swiatek &; Benbow , 1991 ) , and equal to those of a group of National Merit Scholars at the same university ( Janos , et al , 1986 ) . Compared to typical college students , they are more likely to complete college ( Pressy , 1967 ) , to complete college on time ( Brody , Assouline &; Stanley , 1990 ; Stanley &; McGill , 1986 ) , to earn general and departmental honors ( Stanley &; McGill , 1986 ; Brody et al , 1990 ) , to make the dean 's list ( Eisenberg &; George , 1979 ) , to have plans to enter graduate school ( Noble , Robinson &; Gunderson , 1993 ) , and to complete concurrent master 's degrees ( Brody , et al , 1990 ) . The majority of these results are based on students who entered a private , selective , academically prestigious university which did not have a special early entrance program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a large state institution that admitted students immediately after the seventh or eighth grade into a year long transition program at the university . Thus , the demands of these experiences , either because of the academic reputation of the institution or the age of the student , were great , yet the early entrants were very successful . <p> Another early entrance program evaluated the progress of female students who entered college after completing at least one year of high school by administering the Iowa Tests of Educational Development subsequent to the students ' college freshman year . Most students earned scores above the 80th percentile and many above the 95th percentile , compared to 12th grade norms , on tests covering math , literature , social studies and the natural sciences ( Callahan , Cornell &; Lloyd , 1992 ) . Thus , the early entrants achievement was on par with that of typically aged college freshman as assessed by standardized achievement tests . <p> While the results regarding the academic performance of early entrants are overwhelmingly positive , it must be remembered that students who perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in research studies . And , while the average performance level of early entrants is high , there is a range of performance among those who continue in the program . The number of underachieving students in programs is generally not reported . Janos et al . ( 1986 ) did study less successful students and specifically investigated the reasons for underachievement among a group of very young early entrants . These students entered college after the seventh or eighth grade and were part of a program that offers comprehensive support including counseling and a special year long transition program . Janos et al . ( 1986 ) identified 12 students out of 56 ( 21% ) who earned grade point averages that were more than 1.5 standard deviations below those of other early entrance students . Most of the underachievers had dropped out of college for at least one semester , but only two had returned to high school . They had twice as many withdrawals from courses and had received twice as many incompletes as other early entrants . The underachievers tended to alternate between successful and dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to succeed in college despite their age . Their dismal terms were attributed to their general immaturity . Underachieving males in the study were often preoccupied with fantasy games . Underachieving females had quite organized social lives but spent too much of their time involved in these social activities . The underachieving females eventually were able to juggle their social and academic lives and exhibit a consistent pattern of high achievement in the later years of college ( N. Robinson , personal communication , September 12th , 1993 ) . These underachieving students came from one of the earliest years of this program and the percentage of unsuccessful or less successful students is now considerably lower . <p> Another program that admits students two years early classified students as successful on the basis of GPA ( unsuccessful students had a GPA below 2.5 ) and behavior or adjustment problems ( Saylor , 1993 ) . The unsuccessful group also included students who dropped out of program . Forty five percent of the students admitted in the first three years of the program were judged unsuccessful , but many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not serious . Lower ratings based on ' teachers ' recommendations solicited at the time of application best discriminated successful from unsuccessful males . The best discriminator of unsuccessful from successful females was SAT-M ; successful females had SAT-M scores that were an average of 24 points higher than unsuccessful females . Success was also associated with being from a larger family and participation in activities during high school although this varied by sex . Academic activities benefitted females while church and social ones did not ; Social and church activities benefitted males . For males , participation in social activities may have facilitated general maturity and ability to adjust to residential life . For females participation in high school academic activities may indicate seriousness of academic and educational pursuits . These results are interesting in light of Janos et al ( 1986 ) findings regarding factors associated with underachievement for males and females in a radical acceleration program . <p> Saylor ( 1993 ) also reported that of the students admitted in the first three years of the program , 9% of males had adjustment problems , 28% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females the percentages were , 18% adjustment , 23% academic , and 7% behavior . The actual attrition rate for students in the program was not reported but had declined significantly since the first year and was zero as of the fall semester of the fifth year . The percentage of students with academic problems was also cut by 50% ( Saylor , 1993 ) . These changes were attributed to the hiring of counseling staff and better training for residential staff and students . <p> Few other programs have reported their rates for under-achievement or attrition in published articles . An early entrance program for gifted females reported an attrition rate of 30% in the first year of the program . However , this was quickly reduced to 13% when selection procedures were modified and made more stringent . And , Noble , Robinson and Gunderson ( 1993 ) report that 5 to 10% of students who entered college after the seventh or eighth grade dropped out of the program or do poorly . These rates are quite low . <p> One study ( Brody et al , 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early entrants to a private , selective eastern university . The only significant predictor was the number of Advanced Placement courses . It accounted for 16% of the variance in freshman GPA , 12% of the variance in cumulative GPA , 14% of the variance in making the Dean 's list , and 6% of the variance in honors earned by graduation . The authors reasoned that AP courses provided needed exposure to college level work , and helped students to learn advanced course content , gain confidence in their learning abilities , and develop study skills needed for success in college courses . While AP classes may help prepare students who enter one or two years early , students who enter three or four years early typically enter special transition programs to ease them into the college curriculum . Even with such programs , some of these students still report being unprepared for science study at the college level ( Janos , Robinson , &; Lunnenborg , 1989 ) . <p> One of the concerns about entering college early is that the student , because of a desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an institution that is not regarded as academically selective or prestigious . Early entrance students are likely to pursue graduate studies and so the reputation of their undergraduate institution is an important concern . In a longitudinal study of talent search participants , students who entered college early by at least one year were compared to students who entered at the usual time . Accelerants and non accelerants were matched on gender and ability as measured by SAT scores . Results showed that both groups entered academically prestigious colleges and universities ( Benbow &; Swiatek , 1991 ) . However , students who qualified to enter an early entrance program at a public university after the seventh or eighth grade but chose not to , eventually entered more academically selective institutions than those students who entered early ( Janos et al , 1989 ) . <p> At present , the number of colleges or universities with special early entrance programs is small and most of these are not selective institutions . However , almost all of these programs offer important support services to early entrants and may be the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately after completion of elementary school . Students and parents need to weigh the value of a degree from a very academically selective institution versus a degree earned at a more appropriate time in a gifted student 's life from a less prestigious institution . How Do Early Entrants Fare Socially and Emotionally ? <p> Probably the major concern of students who are considering early entrance to college is whether they will fit into the college social life . Will they make friends ? Will they make the adjustment to increased responsibility for oneself and self management ? In comparison to the body of research evidence that exists on the academic performance of early entrants , relatively little exists regarding these issues . One study investigated the friendship patterns of 68 early entrance students who entered a large state university immediately after the seventh or eighth grade ( Janos and Robinson , 1985 ; Janos , et al , 1988 ) . This university had a special support program for early entrants and students spend their entire first year in the transition school with other early entrants The students were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in college for at least 2 years . Almost all of the students , 92% , reported having a best friend and 68% reported having at least five good friends . During the first year , the early entrants spent most of their time with other early entrants , but by their junior year , most of their companions were other typical age college juniors , i.e. two years older than the accelerants on average . Female early entrants acquired older friends more quickly than males . It is possible that the switch to primarily college student friends would have occurred earlier if the early entrants had not been in the transition school . It is also possible that the transition school may be a necessary precursor to friendships with older students , allowing students to mature and gain confidence . <p> Another study of students in this same program solicited comments about their early entrance experience . Results showed that most students perceived the other early entrants as a useful support group during their first few college years ( Noble &; Drummond , 1992 ) . With time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrants and were generally treated well by other college students . The early entrants felt less socially adept at times compared to typically aged college students and less experienced sexually . Physical maturation helped them to blend in better by their sophomore year . Their age did hamper them in some ways -- they could not drive nor reside in the dormitories . But generally , students felt positive about their peer relationships in college . <p> Some research speaks to the issue of general adjustment to college for early entrance students . Cornell , Callahan and Lloyd ( 1991 ) studied the adjustment of 44 females who had left high school after at least one year of study and were enrolled in a residential program at a small liberal arts college . The students had a program of support including special counselors and lived together with other early entrants . On general adjustment measures such as the Jackson Personality Profile , early entrants were found to be better adjusted than high school and even college students . <p> Residential counselors who lived with the early entrants kept logs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any problems they were having . On the basis of these measures , more than half of the females showed signs of depression during their first year , 11% gave indications of suicidal thoughts , and 50% were referred for counseling . Thirty percent of the students left the program after the first year due to what the staff termed " stress-related " factors ( Cornell , Callahan , &; Lloyd , 1991 ) . Girls who made a better adjustment to the program were those who were found to be more responsible , had greater interpersonal interests , had more harmonious family relationships , especially with their mothers , and had structured family environments that emphasized active recreational activities and independence ( Callahan , Cornell &; Lloyd , 1992 ) . <p> Some of these findings may be disturbing but they may also be misleading and not generalizeable ( Stanley , 1991 ) . The study did not compare the early entrants to typical college freshman women . Without data on a comparison group , it is not clear if the percentage of early entrants in distress is unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the earliest groups of early entrants in this program , before selection procedures were well defined and studied . In fact , many of these girls had low IQ 's compared to students typically admitted into gifted programs and given the challenging nature of the program . It appears that many of the earliest participants were simply not prepared to do college level work . In fact , when selection procedures were refined , attrition declined by almost two thirds . It is not known whether the incidence of depression was similarly affected by these changes . <p> Robinson and Janos ( 1985 ) found that students who entered college four to five years early were more independent and unconventional , and less conforming as assessed by measures of personality , compared to students who were equally bright but opted to go to high school and a group of National Merit Scholarship finalists . The authors note that these characteristics may have accounted for these students ' unconventional choice to enter college early . <p> Some early entrants may experience a decrease in self-esteem during the first semester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but these changes are so small as to have no practical significance . Callahan et al . ( 1992 ) reported no changes in Self esteem for participants in an all girls early entrance program over the first year of the program . A decrement in self esteem or self confidence when gifted students enroll in a challenging academic program has been noted before and is usually small in magnitude and temporary in duration ( Olszewski-Kubilius , Kulieke &; Krasney , 1988 ) . <p> Noble and Drummond ( 1992 ) found that early entrants who went through a year long transition program at their university before starting college classes with typical college students , felt that they had matured intellectually and socially during this time and would not have done so if they had stayed in high school . They felt that their early entrance experience had many positive effects including enhancement of their emotional stability ( Noble , Robinson &; Gunderson , 1993 ) . Regrets About Entering Early ? <p> From the available evidence , it appears that few early entrants express regrets about their decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Ford Foundation program mentioned earlier were bored in high school and preferred the college environment despite some adjustment difficulties . However , the respondents in this study represent only a small subsample of the early entrants in this nationwide program . <p> Noble and Drummond ( 1992 ) found that 11 of the 24 students they surveyed who had entered college four to five years early , had no regrets about not attending high school . A few students felt some unhappiness about missing some of the social events and extra-curricular activities of high school and some thought that they might have been eligible for more scholarships if they had gone to high school . But these students also reported that they had been bored in high school and longed for the challenging college environment . <p> In a longitudinal followup of participants in this same early entrance program , Noble , Robinson and Gunderson ( 1993 ) asked three groups of students to indicate their feeling about their decision to accelerate ( or not accelerate ) their education . The three groups included early entrants , students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a group of National Merit Scholarship finalists who entered college at the typical age . Most of the students within each group were satisfied with the degree of acceleration they experienced and chose . Only 18% of 109 early entrants said that they wished they had accelerated less , citing social isolation and family stress primarily as reasons . However , among this small number of students with regrets , most were in the program prior to the creation of the year long transition school . The authors note that these students did not have the special support of adults connected with the program nor other early entrance students and this may have contributed to their feelings . <p> It is really not very surprising that few students regret leaving high school early . Most students who enter college early do so as a last resort . They have exhausted all the opportunities available to them for advanced coursework in high school , and , they do not perceive the social environment to be especially supportive . They view the college environment as more accepting ( Noble &; Drummond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel out of place at college this is not very different than the way they feel in high school . And , at least their academic environment is more suitable . <p> The students most vulnerable for having regrets are those involved in varsity sports . Southern and Jones ( 1992 ) and Stanley ( 1992 ) caution that student athletes considering early entrance must weigh the possibility of not being able to play their sport . But students who enter college early or otherwise accelerate themselves tend not to participate in sports ( Brody &; Benbow , 1986 ) . What Happens After College ? <p> Questions of concern to parents and educators about students who enter college early include what happens to them after college . Are they too young to begin a career or enter some professional schools ? Do they burn out and opt out of further study ? Again the available research evidence is overwhelmingly positive . Much of this evidence is anecdotal reports about individual early entrants . These reports are largely provided by Dr. Julian Stanley ( Stanley , 1985 ) , founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues ( Stanley &; Benbow ; 1983 ) , through which many eventual early entrants to college were initially identified . <p> Typically , these students finished college in less than four years and went on to graduate school . Many are pursuing doctorates and preparing for academic research careers . Some students studied abroad , accepted fellowships or pursued other educational opportunities . Most used the extra time they garnered by entering college early in very productive ways . Generally , the pattern among the early entrants was to continue quickly on with graduate study or in some educational program and not to pause or take time out for other pursuits . <p> There is little published evidence about the career productivity of early entrants ( although Stanley continues to track the lives of many of the early entrants he nurtured through the SMPY program ) nor about any discrimination experienced in graduate school or work due to being so young . However , one study ( Janos et al , 1989 ) found that students who had entered college early did experience frustration due to having to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early career counseling . Despite this difficulty , these same students said they would not have wanted to return to high school . <p> Noble , et al , ( 1993 ) , in their longitudinal follow up of students who had entered college four to five years early , found few differences between the early entrants and same aged students who chose not to enter the program and typically aged college students on measures of attitudes , beliefs , interests , and values . The authors suggest that this indicates that a program of radical acceleration was not harmful to students who were carefully selected for the program and chose to attend . One finding of this study was that the early entrants , as young adults , tended to describe themselves as more restrained , cautious , and introverted than students who chose to go to high school . This is interesting because students in this same program were found to be less conventional in similar comparisons at the start of the program . It can not be concluded that the early entrance experience accounted for the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and the pre and post program measures were not identical . However , it does raise the broader issue of how these experiences affect students ' personalities . Limitations of the Research <p> There are some general limitations to the research reviewed above although these are not specific to studies of early entrants alone . Generally , analyses do not include students who are unsuccessful in the program or can not adjust and drop out . Some results , therefore , may be biased in the positive direction . Also , sample sizes are sometimes small because programs only admit a few students at any one time and some of the research is on single , early cohorts of students , before sample sizes could appreciate . A finding of no difference may thus , be a result of lack of statistical power . And , follow up surveys often have response rates of less than 100% and it is likely that students ' with stronger feelings about the program were more willing to respond . <p> Researchers need to continue to study early entrance students and programs need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful if research reports would include attrition rates and rates of underachieving students . More research about the factors associated with underachievement could improve programs and selection procedures and might assist replication at other sites . Also , more research is needed to determine if early entrance affects students ' motivations , interests , and personalities in significant ways . Group studies of long term outcomes , for both early entrants and students who decide to stay in high school , regarding career and life choices and early career productivity are also needed . Conclusions <p> In summary , parents of students who are considering early entrance to college should be relieved as the available research evidence suggest little cause for worry . The decision about whether to enter college early comes down to whether it is a good match between an educational setting and a student 's needs and characteristics . Issues such as fitting into the college scene , and skill gaps as a result of missing high school course-work and missed high school activities can be exacerbated by the degree of acceleration . These are more problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students entering one or two years early . Southern and Jones ( 1992 ) and Brody and Stanley ( 1992 ) offer some useful guidelines for parents and students to use when making the decision about early entrance . These include making sure a student has had some college level work either through AP courses or college course prior to enrollment as a full time college student . Also , students scores on college entrance exams should equal those of typically aged college freshman despite their younger age . And , students and parents need to consider the ramifications of entering a less selective college if that is all that 's available , missing high school activities or sports and leaving friends . <p> Students can also prepare for the experience by obtaining early career counseling and by developing interests that will be the basis of new friendships . Most important , the decision to enter college early should be primarily the students but once made , families need to be supportive and to recognize that despite their child 's extreme ability , there will be challenges and disappointments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 An earlier version of this article appears in Talent Development , Spring , 1993 , 19-22 , Northwestern University . <p> 
@@4001541 In April 1990 , I was in Japan for a United Nations conference , held in the industrial city of Sendai , on the relationship of science and technology to international peace and security . on the night before returning to the United States , while sleeping in a typical old-style Japanese inn in Kyoto , I had a dream on Earth Day ( April 22 ) that reflected my experience of coming back to a country that had been changed drastically from the place that I had once known . Thirty years ago , my wife and infant first son and I had lived for two years in Japan , a country of exquisite beauty , near Tokyo , in an old house with shoji screens and tatami mats . I returned to a polluted land desecrated by the mindless excesses of industrialization . on every small hill was a tower for power lines , which draped themselves ungracefully across the countryside , dominating the landscape of miniature rises and subtle contours . <p> In my dream , I am on a hillside just across the Hudson River , perhaps in New Jersey , which I had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the seashore . Someone is lecturing to a group of us , as if we were at the United Nations conference from which I have come to Kyoto , that there is still much beauty in the New York City environs . Then , with others from the conference , I take a kind of quick aerial and ground tour of these hills but see no beauty , for on each field of straw-colored New Jersey swamp grass there is at least one rectangular industrial or commercial building . Furthermore , there is an unmistakable chemical stench that pervades the scene , which is only partially acknowledged by the group . <p> The scene shifts to a meeting around a conference table where people are sharing their experiences and what bothers them . I say that what troubles me most , beyond what we have witnessed , is when someone , or a policy , or some enterprise , contradicts , or denies , or pretends that reality is different from that which my own experience tells me it is , that is , invalidates my direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me -- a kind of combination of an energetic representative of the British scientific establishment who was at the conference and of the younger people more eager for change-reacts with positive intensity to my sentiment , and I feel very much support . I will return shortly to certain of the dream 's meanings . A NEW PSYCHoLoGY oF THE ENVIRoNMENT <p> We sense now a need for a new psychology of the environment in order to understand what we have done , and continue to do , individually and collectively , to the Earth that is our home , so that we may change our behavior , locally and globally , in order to save its life . But how is this to be done ? How do we invent a new psychology of our relationship to the Earth ? use the word invent , because of its implication of creating something new , an entity , a combination that had not been put together before . <p> Without a human problem , there is no psychology , or at least not a clinical or dynamic one , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have existed before but which has gained preeminence as a result of new historical and cultural circumstances . Freud and his followers , to a degree , invented psychoanalysis in response to the fact that the extreme , deceitful ordering of men 's and women 's sexual lives by a rigidified bourgeois society was becoming emotionally intolerable and producing behavioral and physiological manifestations that could not be understood or treated by the medicine or neuropsychiatry of their day . We confront now a new kind of problem , global in scope , namely the agonizing murder of the life systems of the Earth , the home on which we depend for everything , which affects each of us in profound personal ways , no matter how intensely we may deny it . <p> This new psychology must include not only the development of a body of theory that would understand or interpret our relationship to the environment , but also ways of working with clients and patients that will bring forth direct or disguised thoughts and feelings in relation to the environment and empower constructive initiatives . At the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distress about pollution or other forms of environmental destruction in dreams and other communications , that we not hear or interpret these simply as displacements from some other , inner source . For example , a young woman in a human growth workshop that I co-led in Manhattan complained that she could not do all of the work , which involved exercises using rapid deep breathing , because the air was too foul . " I ca n't breathe , " she said repeatedly . " It 's just too toxic . Are there chemicals stored here ? " ( There were not . The room we used was a dance hall on the lower West Side. ) others in the workshop resonated with this woman 's complaint and acknowledged the foulness of the city 's air , but they were able to complete this part of the workshop . Although her complaints could have been connected to early childhood experiences of disgust or intrauterine distress , there was no opportunity to explore this possibility . Yet the acknowledgment of the validity of her complaint enhanced postively her further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of psychology is relevant to a problem of this scope ? What would a psychology of the Earth be like ? It would need to be comprehensive , holistic , systemic -- I am not sure what the correct terms would be , except that they must convey the fact of wholeness , connection , interrelatedness , and complexity . It would have to be a dynamic psychology , in the sense that it would need to explore profound , largely ignored conscious and unconscious feelings , impulses , and desires in relation to the physical world , rather than one of the variations of neurophysiology or biochemistry that now dominate the American psychiatric establishment . In addition to recognizing the systemic nature of the problem , the practitioners of this dynamic psychology of the environment would need to tell unpleasant or unwelcome truths about ourselves -- here is one of the meanings of the dream -- as we have learned to do from psychoanalysis but now in an altogether new arena . We would need to explore our relationship with the Earth and understand how and why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in Freud 's time , dynamic psychology was relational , initially describing the forces connecting the agencies of the psyche ( id , ego , and superego ) , and between and among individuals in dyadic relationships , families , and small groups . But a relational psychology of the Earth would be much broader , including our connectedness to peoples and other creatures all over the planet and with the earth itself as a living entity . <p> Actually we ( by " we " I mean , by and large , citizens of Western and other industrialized nations because many native cultures experience and avow a very different relationship to their enviroment ) do have a psychology or at least a prevailing attitude , conscious and unconscious , toward the Earth . We regard it as a thing , a big thing , an object to be owned , mined , fenced , guarded , stripped , built upon , dammed , ploughed , burned , blasted , bulldozed , and melted to serve the material needs and desires of the human species at the expense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel at liberty to kill , paralyze , or domesticate for our own use . Among the many forms of egoism that have come to be the focus of psychodynamically oriented psychologists in an age of self-criticism about our narcissism , this form of species arrogance has received little scrutiny . This attitude contrasts dramatically with the pragmatic , live-and-let-live , and reverential relationship with nature that is reflected in the words of native American leaders such as Chief Seattle ( 1988 ) and Sioux Medicine Man John ( Fire ) Lame Deer ( 1972 ) , who recognized our complete interdependence with the Earth and the need to live in balance and harmony with nature . " This we know , " Chief Seattle told a Pacific Northwest Assembly in 1854 , <p> The earth does not belong to man ; man belongs to the earth . This we know . All things are connected like the blood which unites one family . All things are connected . Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth . Man does not weave the web of life , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the web , he does to himself . ( P. 71 ) <p> More than a century later Lame Deer wrote , <p> To come to nature , feel its power , let it help you , one needs time and patience for that . Time to think , to figure it all out . You have so little time for contemplation . it 's always rush , rush , rush with you . It lessens a person 's life , all that grind , that hurrying and scurrying about . ( P. 2 ) <p> The seemingly mindless destruction of the natural landscape by the Japanese , a people who have been known for their delicate appreciation of nature , attests to the degree to which industrialization and accretion of wealth can overwhelm such sensitivities and separate us from the Earth itself . This cutting off consciousness from a connection with nature and the spirit that most peoples throughout human history have experienced as inherent in it ( and in us , of course , as part of nature ) , is one of the supreme negative achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully demonstrated in modern Japan and is reflected in my dream . one must wonder how or why we have done it , how we have so overdeveloped the use of reason at the expense of feeling in the service of a fear-driven need to conquer other peoples and the material world on a planet with a growing population that is perceived as yielding finite , diminishing resources . Chief Seattle shared this bewilderment . " In your perishing you will shine brightly , " he warned , " fired by the strength of the God who brought you to this land for some special purpose and gave you dominion over this land and over the red man . That destiny is a mystery for us ( Chief Seattle , p. 72 ) . <p> So a psychology of the environment would be an expanded psychology of relationship , a conversation of experiencing in the deepest parts of our being , of our connection with the Earth as sacred . I say sacred because I do not believe that a mere threat to survival will be sufficient to create this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our being . THE INCLUSION OF SPIRITUAL ELEMENTS <p> But here we encounter a problem in developing the new psychology , for it must by virtue of the very nature of the task be a psychology which includes a powerful spiritual element . This will mean , for example , a reanimation of the forests and of nature , which we have so systematically and proudly denuded of their spiritual meaning . As a recent article in the newsletter of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies ( Nichibunken ) entitled " Animism Renaissance , " which acknowledges Japan 's " responsibility for a great deal of destruction of tropical rain forests " ( p. 2 ) , points out , " severe natural destruction started at a point parallel with that of the disappearance of Animism " ( p. 4 ) . <p> Here then is the problem . By and large , we in the West have rejected the language and experience of the sacred , the divine , and the animation of nature . our psychology is predominantly a psychology of mechanisms , parts and linear relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how powerful , that can not be quantified , and we distrust the language of reverence , spirit , and mystical connection , recalling perhaps with fear the superstitiousness and holy wars of earlier periods . Academic psychology , now embodying a reverence for numbers , tight reasoning , and linear thinking in opposition to intuition , direct knowing , and subjective experience is likely to look askance at efforts to reinfuse its body with the imprecise notions of spirituality and philosophy , from which it has so vigorously and proudly struggled to free itself in an effort to be granted scientific status in our universities , laboratories , and consulting rooms . <p> This can not be helped , for the route to a new psychology of the environment , which might contribute to our protecting it , probably can not be achieved by measuring our reactions or talking about the problem . only experiences that profoundly alter our view of nature and reconnect us with the divinity in ourselves and in the environment can empower people to commit themselves to the prodigious task before them . The therapeutic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our being so that we experience the Earth in its living reality . This is why people like Walter and Ellen Christie ( 1984,1985 ) , Joanna Macy ( 1988 ) , and Stanislav and Christina Grof ( 1988 ) , who have been pioneers in creating methods of reconnecting us with the Earth and with ourselves in nature , rely on experiential , imaginal , and consciousness altering or opening approaches . Interestingly , people who open themselves to this connection , discovering their " ecological selves , " seem often now to encounter disturbing images , bad smells , and other psychological experiences of the earth 's desecration in their dreams , fantasies , and deeper consciousness . This can become intolerably painful but also seems to empower people , impelling them to take action on behalf of the deteriorating environment . I have been struck by the fact that powerful images of the Earth 's polluted landscape are appearing with increasing frequency on the covers of leading magazines and in a proliferation of articles in newspapers , magazines , and books , as well as in television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . It is also possible that these images are now significantly penetrating our cultural consciousness and may contribute to fundamental changes in behavior and policy . INSTITUTIONAL , STRUCTURAL , AND SYSTEMIC REALITIES <p> What I have described so far is , in a sense , the easy part of the problem . Deepening our conscious awareness , reanimating our connection with the Earth , is important and can lead to responsible initiatives by individuals . But the stench of my condensed Japanese-New Jersey dream landscape , the pollution of our world , and the destruction of its resources by the Earth 's expanding population are the problems of mankind as a whole , acting collectively through institutions , especially business corporations , often with direct or indirect governmental support . A psychology of the environment to be meaningful must address these powerful institutional , structural , or systemic realities . Social institutions are , in a sense , the expressions of our collective psyches . But we come so much to take their existence and modes of operating for granted that to consider openly that we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inevitably , encounter intense resistance because of the political , economic , and psychological vested interests with which they are associated . To bring about structural changes of this kind , psychologists will need to work closely with policy makers , corporate leaders , economists , and many people representing other related disciplines and groups committed to social change . <p> The political and personal resistance to environmental transformation can be flagrant . When I was in Japan , I read that industrial pollution in Korea had become so severe that , among other things , the water in the public water system in Seoul was condemned as unsafe to drink . A professor at Seoul University who documented the severity of the industrial pollution problem was fired from his position , and people who supported environmental change were accused by the government of being communist sympathisers . I had a similar experience in Paris in 1988 upon returning from a conference in Findhorn , Scotland , on " Politics as If the Whole Earth Mattered . " Fresh from hearing moving talks about the pollution problem and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared my experience and concern with a French psychologist , who dismissed these environmental concerns as communist propaganda , despite the fact that her own senses -- just breathing the air in Paris -- could confirm their truth . <p> Resistance to facing the costs of environmental transformation may extend beyond top management to the shareholders themselves . Initiatives proposed by shareholders from various environmental groups were overwhelmingly rejected by the vastly greater numbers of the company 's supporters at Exxon 's annual shareholders ' meeting in April 1990 . Pleas of wildlife destruction , poisoning of children by toxic chemicals , and other dangers from hazardous waste were ignored , presumably because reparative or healing actions might reduce shareholders ' profit margins and dividends . one Exxon spokesperson suggested to the environmentalists that they should " store your car , stop flying airplanes , and walk or ride a horse in the winter snow or summer heat " ( Hayes 1990 ) . over and above the speaker 's insensitivity , the remark is interesting for its implication , which is not so far off the mark , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a developed society and the fact or extent of industrialization itself . <p> It is not realistic to expect that the environmental crisis will be solved simply by deindustrialization . But the unwelcome news that the new psychology for the environment will need to communicate is that the unbridled license given in the West to free makes forces and the irresponsible overbuilding of heavy industries in the socialist systems have both led to the same disastrous result -- a planet dying in the excesses of human waste . As my barber put it , " Johnny , we are drowning in our industrial feces . " The greatest challenge that we now face in this rapidly changing world is to create political institutions that use the resources of power and responsibility in conjunction with economic structures that are accountable to future generations of human beings , to other species , and to the Earth itself . Psychologists of the environment , while enabling increasing numbers of people to connect with the Earth and its transcendent meaning , must also participate with committed citizens and with community and corporate groups in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformation of our political and economic institutions . Ultimately , this means joining with others in a search for alternatives to the material values that now dominate the spirit in the United States and much of the world . AN INTERNATIONAL AND CROSS-CULTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT <p> An environmental movement on the scale necessary to bring about the changes that are essential for protecting the earth , a process to which psychology has a useful contribution to make , must be authentically international and cross-cultural in two senses . First , we in the West or developed countries must be aware of how powerfully precedent setting is our example . When we destroy our own forests , pollute our air , and poison our streams with our industrial and personal garbage , it little avails us to admonish developing countries for unhygienic industrialization . often heard arguments , such as the fact that we cut down our timber in a more orderly manner than the developing countries destroy their rain forests , become trivial in relation to the psychological and economic forces involved . Second , we need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples of developing countries . Campaigns to save natural resources , such as trees and animals , upon which impoverished peoples depend for their livelihoods , without addressing the material needs of those societies , can not be effective . CONCLUSION <p> In sum , a psychology of the environment to be comprehensive must include at least the following elements : An appreciation that we do in fact , have a relationship with the Earth itself , and the degree to which that relationship has become inimicable to the sustaining of the life of human beings and countless other species . An analysis of traditional attitudes toward the Earth in our own and other cultures that may facilitate or interfere with the maintenance of life . The dominant attitude to the Earth in the industrially developed countries has been one of unchecked exploitation . The application of methods of exploring and changing our relationship to the Earth 's environment that can reanimate our connection with it . These approaches must be emotionally powerful , experiential , and consciousness expanding , opening us to ourselves in relation to nature . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political and economic systems , institutions , and forces embody collective attitudes toward the Earth and its living forms but have a compelling life of their own . Psychologists committed to environmental change must , therefore , work with professional environmentalists , policy makers , population experts , corporate leaders , economists , and representatives of relevant other disciplines to make these structures compatible with an environment that can support the continuation of human life and well being . This will mean , even more than in the case of the nuclear threat , that to be effective psychologists will need to become professionally and personally committed and involved outside of their offices and laboratories . We must discover new forms of personal empowerment for ourselves and our clients that integrate exploration and activism , becoming , men and women together , archetypal warriors in the battle to protect our planet . <p> Kurt Vonnegut ( 1990 ) has recently captured the monumental seriousness of the environmental problem . It is too serious , he says , to be dealt with through humor . " Jokesters , " he writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about challenges so real and immediate and appalling to their listeners that no amount of laughter can make the listeners feel safe and perfectly well again . I found myself doing that on a speaking tour of campuses in the spring of 1989 , and canceled all future engagements .... I said that the whole world faced a problem far worse than the rise of another Hitler , which was our destruction of the planet as a life-supporting apparatus of delicate and beautiful complexity . <p> I said that one day fairly soon we would all go belly up like guppies in a neglected fishbowl . I suggested an epitaph for the whole planet , which was : " We could have saved it , but we were too darn cheap and lazy . " ( P. 14 ) <p>

The rationale was that the harassment was beyond anything related to a business purpose and was personally motivated . <p> In Faragher , Justice David Souter wrote for the majority that " an employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate ( or successively higher ) authority over the employee .

@@4158941 Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp. , which are associated with community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) , are difficult to propagate , and can cause clinically indistinguishable disease patterns . During 2011-2012 , we used molecular methods to test adult patients in Germany with confirmed CAP for infection with these 2 pathogens . Overall , 12.3% ( 96/783 ) of samples were positive for M. pneumoniae and 3.9% ( 31/794 ) were positive for Chlamydia spp. ; C. psittaci ( 2.1% ) was detected more frequently than C. pneumoniae ( 1.4% ) . M. pneumoniae P1 type 1 predominated , and levels of macrolide resistance were low ( 3.1% ) . Quarterly rates of M. pneumoniae-positive samples ranged from 1.5% to 27.3% , showing a strong epidemic peak for these infections , but of Chlamydia spp. detection was consistent throughout the year . M. pneumoniae--positive patients were younger and more frequently female , had fewer co-occurring conditions , and experienced milder disease than did patients who tested negative . Clinicians should be aware of the epidemiology of these pathogens in CAP . # RESEARCH # Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) is associated with high rates of illness and hospitalization ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5 to 1.7 per 1,000 population ( 1 ) . Studies have shown that that a broad range of pathogens can cause CAP ( 2 ) . Among these is Mycoplasma pneumoniae , a common agent of respiratory tract infections that is transmitted from person to person through aerosolization . The infection occurs in all age groups , but older children and young adults are affected at a higher frequency than other age groups . Clinical manifestations range from mild cases of tracheobronchitis to severe atypical pneumonia and can be followed by a broad spectrum of extrapulmonary complications . # The epidemiology of M. pneumoniae infection is characterized by incidence peaks every 4-7 years ; during these periods , M. pneumoniae is responsible for up to 25% of all cases of CAP ( 3 ) . Between epidemic periods , proportions of 1%-8% are more typical ( 4 ) . Reports from Europe and Asia have shown a notable increase in the frequency of infections caused by M. pneumoniae during 2011-2012 ( 5-12 ) . # For clarification of the epidemiology of M. pneumoniae infection and identification of the relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strains can be an efficient tool . M. pneumoniae strains can be divided into subtypes and variants according to sequence differences in the gene coding for the immunodominant main adhesin P1 . It has been hypothesized that the specific antibody level in the host population can influence further infections and lead to a change of the dominating P1 type ( 13 ) . The recently developed multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat ( VNTR ) analysis ( MLVA ) enables differentiation of strains with higher discriminatory power ( 14 ) . Further studies are necessary to determine associations between P1 and MLVA typing . However , knowledge of the strain 's genotype identity currently has no therapeutic consequences . Because mycoplasmas , which do not have cell walls , are not susceptible to ? -lactam antimicrobial drugs , macrolides are generally accepted as first-choice agents for treatment , especially in children . However , mutations in the 23S rRNA locus of M. pneumoniae have been shown to result in complete macrolide resistance ( 15 ) . Resistance rates range from &gt;90% in China ( 16 ) to &lt;10% in Europe ( 15 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance or resistant strains . # Chlamydia pneumoniae is another agent associated with CAP that can also be involved in pharyngitis , bronchitis , and sinusitis . Reports have attributed 6%-20% of CAP cases to this bacterium ( 17 ) , and its role in chronic respiratory illness ( 18 ) and exacerbation of asthma ( 19 ) has also been studied . C. pneumoniae infection is regarded as widely distributed , if not ubiquitous , with antibody prevalence rates &gt;50% ( 19 ) . The clinical course of infection varies from subclinical to mild and , more rarely , to severe manifestations of pneumonia . The outcome of infection is often dependent on the patient 's immune competence , but co-infection by other bacteria has been suggested to be relevant in 30% of adult cases of CAP ( 20 ) . However , a discrepancy exists between the elevated serologic prevalence and the low figures obtained through DNA-based detection methods ( 21 ) ; a recent publication from Germany reported a prevalence &lt;1% ( 22 ) . # Other Chlamydia spp. have not usually been included in epidemiologic studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causative agent of human psittacosis ( or ornithosis ) , has not been investigated except in severe clinical pneumonia cases . As is the case for infections caused by by other chlamydiae , an asymptomatic or mild clinical course of C. psittaci is far more frequent than a fulminant outbreak of disease . Nevertheless , infections that do not result in overt illness may have long-term implications for the patient 's health , as was shown in cattle that were carriers of Chlamydia spp. but did not show signs of disease ( 23 ) . # In this study , we used molecular diagnostic approaches to investigate the occurrence of M. pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp. in adult patients in Germany who had confirmed CAP . The use of molecular typing methods for M. pneumoniae in combination with the determination of macrolide resistance was intended to obtain a nationwide overview of circulating strains in a period of high incidence of infections .

The decision on timing and type of treatment for each patient is left to the discretion of the attending physician . No attempt is made to implement standardized criteria or rules for the assessment of pneumonia severity or for the decision to hospitalize. # For this study , we prospectively recorded all consecutive and nonselected patients who sought treatment for signs and symptoms of CAP during March 2011-December 2012 . Eligible participants were adult patients ( ? 18 years of age ) who had CAP confirmed by a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph and ? 1 sign or symptom of lower respiratory tract infection ( i.e. , fever , cough , purulent sputum , focal chest signs ) .

Positive samples were further examined by using a C. psittaci-specific real-time PCR ( 26 ) and a DNA microarray assay in ArrayStrip format that covered all Chlamydia spp. , Waddlia chondrophila , and Simkania negevensis ( 27 , 28 ) . # Testing for M. pneumoniae # Aliquots of the DNA extracts were examined by using a previously described real-time PCR assay targeting copies of the repetitive element RepMP1 ( 29 ) . Positive samples were further tested for macrolide resistance by methods previously reported ( 15 ) .

Patients who had M. pneumoniae infection were significantly younger and more frequently female , had fewer co-occurring conditions , and experienced significantly milder disease that did those who did not have M. pneumoniae infection ( Table 1 ) . M. pneumoniae-positive patients were more frequently pretreated with antimicrobial drugs ; however , we found no significant differences in the classes of antimicrobial drugs administered , particularly not in the use of macrolides. # Using real-time PCR targeting the RepMP1 copies in the M. pneumoniae genome , we calculated a median of 7.8 x 10 copies ( range 4.1 x 10 to 1.5 x 106 ) in the M. pneumoniae-positive samples . M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? 4% was found at the beginning and the end of the investigation period , but high positivity was found during October 2011-December 2011 . Quarterly incidence ranged from 1.5% ( quarter 3 , 2012 ) to 27.3% ( quarter 4 , 2011 ) ( Figure 1 ) . # The percentage of M. pneumoniae-positive patients from each age group ranged from 28.1% for the 18- to 29-year age group to 13.5% for the &gt;60-year age group ( Figure 2 ) . The prevalence of M. pneumoniae decreased by age group : 18-29 years , 38% ; 30-39 years , 31% ; 40-49 years , 17% ; 50-59 years , 13% ; ? 60 years , 3% . More than half ( 55% ) of M. pneumoniae-positive patients were female ; only the 18- to 29-year age group had more M. pneumoniae-positive men than women . # Regarding the P1 genotype , all strains in the 96 M. pneumoniae-positive samples could be typed culture independently . Subtype 1 strains dominated ( 60.4% ; Figure 1 , panel B ) , followed by variant 2a ( 19.8% ) , variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subtype 2 strains ( 2.1% ) . A high proportion of subtype 1 strains were found during the entire 22-month investigation period , and all P1 types detected during the period were found at nearly the same proportion during the high-incidence period of October-December 2011. # Highly discriminatory MLVA was carried out on all positive samples using nested PCR . For 87 of the 96 samples , the complete recommended panel of 5 tandem-repeat regions could be amplified and sequenced successfully . Overall , 23 MLVA types were identified . The most common MLVA types were 4/4/5/7/2 ( n = 12 , 13.8% ) and 5/4/5/7/2 ( n = 11 , 12.6% ) . During the high-incidence period ( quarter 4 of 2011 ) , the 42 M. pneumoniae strains that showed valid MLVA results belonged to 16 MLVA types . No clear correlation was found between P1 and MLVA typing . The 51 classifiable subtype 1 strains can be assigned to 16 MLVA types ( Table 2 ) . Five of these MLVA types can also be found in subtype 2 and the related variant 2 strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance can be assumed in 3 of the 96 M. pneumoniae-positive specimens ( 3.1% ) . All strains showed an A.G mutation at position 2063 of the 23S rRNA . The macrolide-resistant strains belonged to the predominant subtype 1 in P1 typing but differed in MLVA type ( 2/3/6/6/2 , 2/4/5/7/2 , and 5/4/5/7/2 ) . The specimens containing resistant strains were sampled at different points of the study : December 2011 , April 2012 , and August 2012 . All affected patients were female ( ages 31 , 42 , and 42 years ) . For 2 of these patients , treatment with macrolides during the month before sampling was reported . # We further tested 794 patients for Chlamydia spp . ( Table 3 ) ; 31 ( 3.9% ) patients tested positive , 6 with dual infections ( Table 4 ) . In contrast to the M. pneumoniae findings , we found no significant differences in clinical characteristics between Chlamydia-positive and -negative patients ( Table 3 ) . Notably , no Chlamydia-positive patients received macrolides , whereas 8.3% of Chlamydia-negative patients did . # Test results identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , followed by C. pneumoniae ( 1.4% ) . In addition , C. trachomatis , Simkania negevensis , and the animal pathogens C. suis , C. abortus and Waddlia chondrophila were identified in individual samples . The use of a DNA microarray assay combined with real-time PCR assays enabled us to detect multiple chlamydial infections ; all 6 dual chlamydial infections ( representing 19.3% of Chlamydia-positive patients ) involved C. psittaci , 3 in conjunction with C. pneumoniae and 1 each with C. abortus , S. negevensis , and W. chondrophila . Co-infections with M. pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp. were detected in 3 samples ( 3.1% of M. pneumonia-positive and 8.1% of Chlamydia-positive specimens ) : 1 M. pneumoniae + C. psittaci , 1 M. pneumoniae + C. pneumoniae , and 1 M. pneumoniae + C. psittaci + C. pneumoniae. # Discussion # Many studies have described the strictly time-dependent epidemiology of infections caused by M. pneumoniae ( 3 ) . Although we did not include serologic testing to provide further information for the differentiation of colonization of patient from infection , the results of our study confirm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients with suspected CAP in Germany during 2011-2012 . The incidence of infections temporarily rose to ? 27% during the fourth quarter of 2011 , a level that is in accordance with other reports ( 5-12 ) . Despite limited comparability ( e.g. , target used ) , the number of RepMP1 copies measured with real-time PCR ( median 7.8 x 10 ) is in the range of results of other studies ( 32 , 33 ) . Because of the short duration of the epidemic peak and known deficiencies in testing routines for symptomatic M. pneumoniae patients , an increase in incidence could easily escape the notice of public health authorities . Moreover , because patients with M. pneumoniae infection were significantly younger than those without infection , it is possible that the true incidence might even be higher , given the fact that younger persons visit physicians less frequently and are admitted to hospitals less often than older patients . In addition , ? -lactams are often used as the first-line antimicrobial drugs for CAP but are known to be inefficient in treatment of Mycoplasma infections ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathogen . In light of these results , revision of recent guidelines for management of CAP with antimicrobial drugs should be considered . # Typing of strains can help clarify the dynamics of epidemic peaks . There is no evidence that the incidence peak we registered was related to the genotype of circulating strains . M. pneumoniae is a genetically conserved organism , which implies limits to potential typing targets ; most frequently used is P1 , the main adhesin and most immunogenic protein , where sequence variation occurs mainly in the 2 copies of repetitive elements RepMP2/3 and RepMP4 of the P1-encoding locus mpn141 . The epidemiologic importance of P1 genotypes is based on their ability to generate a specific host immune response ( 13 ) . Therefore , P1 genotyping of circulating mycoplasma strains is helpful for understanding host pathogen interactions and the infections ensuing . The current dominance of subtype 1 strains in combination with a rare occurrence of subtype 2 was also described in Europe and Asia ( 11 , 34 ) . Subtype 2 strains have been replaced with the phylogenetically related variant 2 strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The variant 2c of this group was described in 2011 in several isolates from China ( 34 ) ; our detection of variant 2c strains in Germany confirms the parallel circulation of most variant 2 strains described this far . # In this study , only particular regions of the P1 gene were selected for analysis , and the occurrence of additional P1 types showing further sequence variations can not be ruled out . The recently characterized variant 2d ( 35 ) shares an identical 3 ' part of the RepMP2/3 with variant 2a but differs in the 5 ' region of the repetitive element ; on the basis of those results , we retested all variant 2a strains , but we could not confirm the occurrence of variant 2d. # For epidemiologic reasons , it is important that the period with a high proportion of M. pneumoniae-positive samples ( October-December 2011 ) was not associated with a change of the dominating genotype nor with the presence of a particular P1 type . Previous reports have hypothesized that the circulation of genotype-specific antibodies in the human population can influence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but our data do not support this hypothesis . # In recent years , MLVA was introduced for typing of M. pneumoniae isolates ( 14 ) and extended to culture-independent typing from clinical samples ( 31 ) . The determination of the number of 5 VNTR markers ( Mpn1 , 13-16 ) enables characterization of strains with a higher discriminatory power in comparison with P1 typing . Whereas the genomic regions used for MLVA are located mainly between genes and within genes of unknown function , the P1 protein plays a critical role in host-pathogen interaction . The most common MLVA types ( 4/4/5/7/2 and 5/4/5/7/2 ) we detected were also found in high abundance in strains recently identified in France , China , and the United States ( 11 , 16 , 36 ) , thus indicating a worldwide dissemination of particular MLVA types . # Regarding the strains included in our study , the assignment of P1 types to MLVA types confirmed that no clear relationship between the typing methods exists ( Table 2 ) . In agreement with the results of other reports ( 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P1 subtype 1 strains belong to MLVA types that are typical for subtype 2 or variant strains ( e.g. , 5/3/5/6/2 ) and vice versa . In our opinion , both typing approaches are of practical importance and complement each other ; the circulating P1 types reflect a more host-dependent pattern , whereas MLVA can differentiate strains with higher discriminatory power , enabling a better understanding of epidemiologic relationships . # Instability of VNTR marker 1 has been reported ( 36 ) , and the removal of Mpn1 from the current MLVA scheme has been suggested ( 16 ) . For our data , the removal of Mpn1 would reduce the number of MLVA genotypes to 9 , with &gt;80% of strains belonging to 2 types , 3/5/6/2 and 4/5/7/2 . This change would result in a substantial decrease of the discriminatory power of the MLVA typing method and would require efforts to include further VNTR markers showing a stable number of repeats within a given strain . # The data from our study confirm that a nationwide peak of infections caused by M. pneumoniae is polyclonal , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In contrast , the clonal spread of M. pneumoniae can only be expected for small-scale endemic outbreaks with person-to-person transmission in close communities , such as families ( 37 ) . # Since 2000 , an increase of the worldwide occurrence of macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae strains to 90% and higher has reported . Compared with data from Asia ( 16 ) , the proportion of 3.1% of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains we detected is low . Results of studies from Germany in recent years have showed results in the same range ( 15 ) , thus indicating a nearly constant prevalence of resistance . Nevertheless , resistant strains are circulating in the population we investigated , which requires further monitoring of strains to provide an updated overview of drug resistance . Several reports have confirmed that resistant strains were selected during antimicrobial drug treatment ( 38 ) . However , in our study , increased prescription of macrolide antimicrobial drugs , which can be expected during a period of high CAP incidence , did not result in a measurable increase of resistant strains . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results of this study are of general interest because we report on adult patients . # Although further sequence differences of the 23S rRNA locus of M. pneumoniae have been described , the A ? G mutation at position 2063 is most common ( 15 , 16 ) . Comparison of sequencing results with antimicrobial susceptibility testing confirmed that the mutation at positions 2063/2064 led to a high level of macrolide resistance ( 15 ) . Thus , with the mutation detected , resistance of these strains can be assumed . We did not find macrolide resistance to be associated with a certain MLVA type , which confirms the findings of other reports ( 16 ) , but the low number of resistant strains in our study is insufficient for us to draw a final conclusion . # The results of Chlamydia testing are remarkable for the comprehensive methodologic approach . In the past , the choice of diagnostic tests was usually limited : that is , either only C. pneumoniae was analyzed or all Chlamydia spp. identified were thought to be C. pneumoniae . Although the positivity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous data from Germany ( 22 ) , the proportions of positive samples of 2.1% for C. psittaci and 4.7% for all Chlamydiae spp. considered here deserve specific attention ( Table 4 ) . Chlamydial co-infection involving &gt;2 Chlamydia spp. has been shown to be frequent in trachoma patients ( 39 ) , but data from pneumonia patients remain scarce . Our finding that 19.3% of Chlamydia-positive patients harbored ? 2 Chlamydia spp. is in the same range as the 24% found in a recent trachoma study ( 40 ) . # One unexpected finding in our study was that C. psittaci positivity could not be correlated with the patients having regular contact with birds at home or at work . Moreover , no seasonal patterns were identified . Nevertheless , our findings indicate that chlamydial species other than C. pneumoniae should be included in testing of CAP patients ; in particular , C. psittaci should be included but also C. trachomatis . The relatively high prevalence of C. psittaci we found raises questions about its epidemiologic and etiologic importance , which should be addressed in future studies . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. pneumoniae-positive respiratory samples among adult patients with confirmed CAP in Germany during 2011-2012 . During the fourth quarter of 2011 , the incidence of infections temporarily rose to ? 27% of all patients investigated . Chlamydia spp. were found in 3.9% of samples , without epidemic peaks . Throughout the study period , the dominant M. pneumoniae P1 type was subtype 1 ; only 3.1% of M. pneumoniae strains were macrolide resistant . Both bacteria represent relevant pathogens in CAP , and awareness of their epidemiology , particularly among clinicians , is clearly warranted . # Members of the CAPNETZ Study Group : M. Dreher , C.

@@4016641 The tarnished plant bug does n't have anything else to blame for its notorious reputation . This pest has been causing farmers trouble for a long time and does n't seem likely to clear its name . In fact , like its " partners in crime " -- tobacco budworm and cotton bollworm -- it was recently added to the list of cotton pests that are showing resistance to insecticides . This is n't good news for cotton growers . <p> " Cotton is a major cash crop in the Mississippi Delta region , and farmers simply ca n't afford to add another damaging pest to the list , " says entomologist Gordon L. Snodgrass . He is in ARS ' Southern Insect Management Research Unit at Stoneville , Mississippi . <p> In August 1993 , Snodgrass discovered that tarnished plant bugs , Lygus lineolaris , had become resistant to pyrethroids , a class of insecticides commonly used to control them . <p> Plant bugs are a particular problem , because there are more than 100 different weed species on which they can feed and reproduce , Snodgrass says . In winter , the bugs lie dormant in weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they emerge and begin laying eggs in the weeds . In late spring , when the weeds mature , the bugs move to cotton crops . <p> " This is a weak point in their life cycle , " Snodgrass says . " We want to stop population buildups by breaking their cycle early in the season , before they move into cotton . " <p> Not to be confused with the western tarnished plant bug -- a widespread pest west of the Rockies -- the eastern tarnished plant bug feeds on many vegetable , fruit , and ornamental crops throughout the United States and Canada . <p> Snodgrass says the pest could reverse the trend in areas where a boll weevil eradication program is in full swing . Farmers have been able to cut down on sprayings for boll weevils , but they would have to continue or resume spraying for plant bugs . <p> Concern about this cotton pest -- which cost $75 million last year in control measures alone -- has led to the ARS areawide tarnished plant bug project . <p> A 3- to 4-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four 9-square-mile areas in the Mississippi Delta , with a possibility of future expansion . <p> The goal is to find if controlling weeds early in the season can prevent damaging numbers of plant bugs from invading cotton later on . Enlisting Grower Support <p> In the first test last summer , Snodgrass and entomologists William P. Scott and D.D . Hardee , who heads the insect management research unit , mowed or applied certain herbicides to control weeds . They reduced weed density in the treated areas , causing a sharp reduction in tarnished plant bugs compared to untreated areas . <p> " This project involves a major cooperative effort between ARS and Mississippi State University Delta Branch and Extension Center , " says Scott , who is also in the Stoneville unit . " Through USDA 's Farm Service Agency , we identified about 60 growers in the test areas and asked them to participate in the project . They were very cooperative , allowing us to spray herbicides and survey their fields . Farmers realize tarnished plant bugs are a serious pest , and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another approach to helping growers protect their cotton from the bugs is integrated biological control , says biological control specialist Livy H. Williams , also in the Stoneville unit . His research focuses on improving the physiology and behavior of beneficial insects to make them more effective against pests . Strategies include developing better ways to rear and release beneficials and providing food sources and shelter to help them survive in the field . <p> Williams says applying pesticides makes it difficult to use natural enemies of pests , since " good guy " insects succumb to the same insecticides that kill bad ones . " Finding ways to manipulate a suitable environment for natural enemies to persist and survive is a major challenge , " says Williams . " One way of doing this is targeting our efforts when the tarnished plant bugs are on their spring weed hosts , before they move into cotton . " Parasitic Wasps and Other Insect Allies <p> Williams says they 've identified a tiny wasp parasitoid , Anaphes iole , which is widespread in North America and has been used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarnished plant bug eggs and lays its own egg inside -- killing the plant bug and regenerating its own population . It does n't bother other insects or animals . <p> " For the wasps to be abundant in the spring , " Williams says , " we need an alternate host for them in winter , when plant bugs are in the adult stage . The wasps attack only the eggs , and plant bug eggs are scarce until spring . Ideally , wasps should emerge in the spring before pesticides are sprayed . " <p> Williams and others at Stoneville have identified several plant bug predators , including minute pirate bugs , green lacewings , and big eyed bugs . With the help of ARS ' Biological Control and Mass Rearing Research Unit in Starkville , Mississippi , Williams is evaluating the effectiveness of the wasps and several plant bug predators . The unit is headed by entomologist Donald A. Nordlund . <p> Starkville scientists are working on artificial diets for the tarnished plant bug and some of its predators . <p> In another control strategy tried last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female attraction to sticky traps baited with either live males or females .

@@4015041 Section : Articles Summary <p> Background Compulsory urine testing of prisoners for drugs , a control initiative , was introduced in eight prisons in England and Wales early in 1995 .

Major cost-generating events were the punishment of refusals -- over one third of cost a ) -- and testing positive for cannabis -- over 50% of cost a ) . In Scotland , around 5% of injecting drug users ( IDUs ) are incarcerated at any time : 5% of Lothian 's drugs care , treatment and prevention costs and 2.5% of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget in 1993-94 amounted to UK101300 per annum -- or UK7770 per 28 days ( $US11970 ) -- and about 35% of monthly MDT costs . <p> Interpretation We suggest that 5% of current resources for drugs prevention and treatment and for IDU-targetted HIV/AIDS prevention should be directed towards the prisons because in the prisons , where 5% of the clients are at any time , injectors have less access to harm reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 348 : 1124-27 Introduction <p> Compulsory urine testing for drugs in prisoners was introduced in eight prisons in England and Wales -- including Holloway ( a women 's prison ) -- early in 1995 . Neither ethical and scientific arguments against compulsory tests as a means of gathering information ' ( 1 ) nor operational objections ( 2 ) dissuaded the Prison Service from extending its war on drugs ' to all prison establishments in England and Wales by March 1996 . <p> The 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act permits both random and on suspicion ' selection of prisoners from whom a urine sample can be required and tested for drugs . During the pilot phase of mandatory testing , random sampling has been organised from Prison Service headquarters . Refusal to provide the required urine sample breaches prison rules and is punishable by 28 days ' loss of remission . Prisoners whose urine sample tests positive for cannabis only are liable to punishment of 14 days ' loss of remission , and 21 days if their sample is positive for class A drugs such as heroin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory ) drugs testing ( MDT ) to the healthcare budget for a prison and to the cost of putting in place a prisons ' drugs reduction programme . We compare average , not marginal , costs . The former will tend to the latter in the medium term , however , as additional prison places and staff are eventually required to avoid disorder in the prisons occasioned by overcrowding and undermanning . <p> We use data from Scotland to put in context the extent of the injecting drug use problem prisons face . Methods <p> Table 1 shows cost-generating events for MDT , unit costs , and applicable percentages from the MDT pilot study. ( 3 ) We assume that 10% of prisoners are required to provide a urine sample , as in the pilot study . Refusal rate of between 0 and 10% is assumed , and was quoted as 8% in a personal communication in May , 1995 from the then Director-General of the Prison Service . We estimated the cost of loss of remission from the Prison Service Annual Report and Accounts ( 4 ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are assumed to be positive on SYVA testing ( 5 ) and to remain positive on confirmation by gas chromatography -- mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) . 20% urine samples negative on SYVA testing are assumed to be rechecked and confirmed as negative by GC-MS ( this simplification ignores false positive and false negative SYVA test results . ) <p> Cross-sectional Willing Anonymous Salivary HIV ( WASH ) surveillance studies and risk-factor elicitation in Scottish prisons6 and at Bullindon Prison near Oxford have shown that 20% or more ( 6 ) prisoners have injected drugs ; that 50% of injectors have injected in prison , probably currently7 as well as ever. ( 6 ) We therefore assume that 10% of all inmates inject class A drugs inside prison currently but the proportion who inject regularly , for example twice a week , has not been documented . A class A drug such as heroin remains detectable in urine for 3 days . <p> Answers to parliamentary questons in May 1995 , concerning the outcome since February 1995 , of MDT in pilot prisons , ( 8 ) revealed that 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three for heroin/benzodiazepines . Our assumptions were based on these figures . Results <p> In accordance with the assumptions in table 1 , tables 2a and b give estimates of the cost per 28 days of the random mandatory drugs testing control initiative in an establishment for 500 inmates where the refusal rate is 10% ( table 2a ) or 0% ( table 2b ) ; and 35% of urine samples test positive , one tenth of these for class A drugs as reported in Parliament in May 1995. ( 8 ) Costs are estimated at between UK22 800 ( $US35 100 ) and UK16 000 ( $US24 600 ) per 28 days . Major cost-generating events are the punishment of refusals ( more than 33% of cost in table 2a ) and of testing positive for cannabis ( over 50% of cost in table 2a and over 80% of cost in table 2b ) . Costs decrease roughly in proportion to any decrease in penalty days , because the cost of testing is relatively minor in terms of overall cost . <p> The 1993-94 Report of the Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure from April , 1993 , to March , 1994 , as UK58.215 million pounds ( at 1993-94 prices ) ; equivalent to UK4.4658 million per 28 days ( $US6.877 million ) . Since the average prison occupancy for the same period was 53020 , healthcare expenditure for an establishment with 500 prisoners averaged UK42114 per 28 days ( $US64860 ) . The cost of random MDT per 28 days is thus equivalent to about half the healthcare budget of such a prison . <p> Experts in treatment of drug abuse estimate that it costs UK100 000 per annum ( $US154 000 ) to run a drugs reduction and rehabilitation programme in a prison with 500 inmates ( personal communication , Mr Tony O'Regan , Co-ordinator of Drugs and Alcohol Services , Huntingdon , UK ) ; less than half the cost of random MDT . <p> Table 3 shows regional data on estimated number of injecting drug users by capture-recapture methods. ( 10-12 ) HIV prevalence in injectors from community HIV surveillance studies , ( 13-15 ) together with number of injector-inmates derived from cross-sectional WASH surveillance studies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HIV-infected injector-inmates . Data on the size of populations ( 20 ) were also required . The prevalence of injecting drug use varies geographically and prevalence in men may be almost twice that for women . HIV prevalence in current injecting drug users also varies geographically . It is , for example , much higher for injectors from Scotland 's east coast -- Lothian and Tayside regions -- than those from Greater Glasgow or Liverpool . Despite geographical variation in the prevalence of injecting drug use , consistently across the regions about 7% of male injectors are in prison at any time . The proportion is lower for women ; only 1% of Greater Glasgow 's female injectors were in Cornton Vale , Scotland 's only prison for female offenders. ( 6 , 19 ) We thus estimate that 5.4% ( table 3 , 469/8700 ) of Greater Glasgow 's injectors are in prison at any time ( this is the only region in the UK with all necessary data available for both sexes ) . <p> Corroboration comes from another source . The Scottish Affairs Committee , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) estimated that there were 20 000 injecting drug users in Scotland , or some 11 300 outside Greater Glasgow . Two thirds of these , around 7500 , would be expected to be male . Cross-sectional WASH surveillance in 1991-95 covered some 40% of the Scottish male prison population and included 150 male drug injectors from outside Greater Glasgow ( table 3 ) . This leads to an estimate of 375 ( 150/0.4 ) non-Glasgow injectors in all prisons for men , or 5% of male injectors outside of Greater Glasgow being in prison at any time . <p> Thus , since 5% of a region 's injectors are incarcerated at any time , it would appear reasonable that around 5% of the region 's drugs prevention and treatment budget and an apportionment of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget should be assigned to its prisons . Lothian 's 1993-94 Drug Abuse Services cost UK138 473 for care and treatment , and UK1052 029 for prevention ; and the AIDS/HIV projects cost UK5079171 for care and treatment and 1670277 for prevention ( totals of UK1190 552 and 6749 488 , respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half Lothian 's HIV diagnoses have been in injecting drug users , ( 20 ) we assume that half the region 's HIV/AIDS prevention budget has targeted injectors . Five percent of Lothian 's drugs care , treatment and prevention costs and 2.5% of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget amounts to UK101 300 -- or UK7770 per 28 days ( $US11 970 ) -- and about 35% of monthly MDT costs . <p> After the parliamentary questions in May 1995 , further questions elicited the information that from February to May , 1995 , there were 1089 random MDT tests , of which 362 ( 33.2% ) were positive for cannabis and 44 ( 4.1% ) positive for opiates or benzodiazepines : but from June to December 1995 , when there were 2282 random tests , 663 ( 29.1% ) were positive for cannabis and 168 ( 7.4% ) for opiates or benzodiazepines . This is an 80% increase in the percentage of inmates testing positive for opiates or benzodiazepines . Since provisional assault figures for 1995 for the pilot prisons also show a 20% increase in assaults over 1993-94 figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at best , MDT has zero effectiveness in countering addiction and disorder ; we do so implicitly hereafter . Discussion <p> Research has shown that starting to inject drugs inside prison is associated with longer sentences as well as with local and individual prison-related factors. ( 23 ) Certainly , the issue of drug use in prison can not be tackled in isolation . The World Health Organization ( 24 ) and the 1994/95 Report of the Director of Prison Healthcare ( 25 ) recommend that healthcare in prisons should , wherever possible , be equivalent to that outside . Because most injecting drug users enter the prison system ( 26 ) after remand for a drugs-related offence or for theft or prostitution to fund their habit , prisons provide a unique opportunity to target educational and drugs rehabilitation programmes towards them at a time of potential receptivity but also vulnerability from loss of self-esteem and inevitable stress . <p> A major part of the Prison Service 's strategy to reduce drug misuse in prison is the introduction of MDT to identify drug users , punish them and offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently unresourced , ( 27 ) to Scotland from February , 1996 . Our analysis of average costs raises questions about a policy which apparently is ineffective in terms of reducing addiction and assaults. ( 3 ) <p> We estimate that at any one time about 5% of the UK 's injecting drug users are in prison . This would suggest that a similar proportion of education , rehabilitation , and support resources should be available to the prisons , a far larger figure than is identifiable in current budgets . However , this investment would represent only between 35% and 50% of the costs of MDT , over half of which is incurred as extra days in prison for cannabis takers . The control initiative of MDT has not produced anticipated benefits. ( 3 ) A supportive drug substitution and rehabilitation programme would introduce immediate and longer-term benefits both for the prison and for the outside community in reduced recidivism . It is possible that loss of remission as the result of positive urine tests or refusal may reinforce the very reason for taking drugs -- escape from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place. ( 28 , 29 ) <p> Our costing of MDT does not include the hidden human cost of acquiring HIV or Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection by using contaminated injection equipment . We welcome , however , the recent availability of disinfection tablets in UK prisons . Existing drug rehabilitation schemes in prison are under-resourced , resulting in waiting lists in prisons with large numbers of injecting drug users , such as Saughton and Glenochil Prisons in Scotland. ( 30 ) Investment in , and priority for , MDT in England and Wales is unlikely to be matched immediately by parallel investment in drug rehabilitation programmes , despite the exhortation of a Parliamentary Select Committee . We argue that resources which are already available in the community outside should be redistributed on a direct apportionment basis to the prison medical services as part of a long-term initiative on prison healthcare , and we suggest a figure of 5% .

There is no lack of willingness on part of prisons to tackle this issue sympathetically and professionally. ( 30 ) The strong geographical correlation between deprivation and injection drug use ( 11 ) can not be resolved by the prisons alone but concerns all society . <p>

Research last year by Alcohol Concern and the Children 's Society estimated that 2.6 million children in the UK live with a parent whose drinking could lead to neglect or abuse . </p> For social workers it is notoriously difficult to know whether a parent who claims to have kicked their habit is being truthful and whether their new , reformed lifestyle can survive temptation . As a result , social workers are becoming more reliant on hair strand-testing to profile patterns of drug and alcohol use . </p> " It 's difficult to give numbers , but a significant proportion of care cases now use these tests , " says Jacqui Gilliatt , a family law barrister .

They are also lobbying the government for the UK 's 35,000 or so foster carers to undergo drug and alcohol tests . </p> But are the tests reliable and accurate ? For drugs , hair analysis can profile usage going back as long as the hair sample allows - as much as 12 months if it is long enough , says Graham Sievers , director of Trichotech , another leading hair testing company . </p> " It 's a very good way of analysing people who are still having a problem with drugs and those who have got over any problem and beaten the addiction .

We can show where heroin was occurring in the sample 10-11 months ago and where over the last six months the drug has declined to zero . " </p> TESTS FOR ALCOHOL USE Tests for alcohol are not so conclusive . Hair strand tests for alcohol can look at one or both of two different chemical markers that indicate whether or not a person has been drinking . But because these markers can be deposited in the body through certain foods or be washed out through shampooing , hair strand tests revealing low levels of these chemicals are not conclusive . </p> " Hair alcohol tests are less definitive and can only really determine chronic excessive alcohol use , " says Sievers . " If they show elevated levels of the markers above a certain amount , that is a helpful indicator of someone who might have an excessive alcohol problem . But hair alcohol tests can not be used for sobriety testing . So if a test is negative - ie below a cut off point - it does n't mean a person has not been drinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court case at the end of 2010 ( see box ) .

" This case showed that it 's very important to acknowledge these tests are part of a picture , but if everything else points in another direction , you should n't just look at the numbers on one test . </p> " These procedures have come to be looked at almost like they 're a pregnancy test , showing a ' yes ' or ' no .

" Back in 2006 , all social services had to go on was how many empty bottles were in a person 's house , whether the house looked healthy , and so on .

@@4009341 The supervisor of interns in the public schools needs to be a caring person who has excellent human relations skills . He/she needs to have carefully chosen objectives to implement in providing the best of experiences for interns . The intern of today needs to be a professional who will soon be a teacher of America 's most precious heritage -- our children . <p> Interns and cooperating teachers , working as a team , need assistance from the university supervisor so that the former develops into becoming a professional teacher . I have supervised interns for approximately thirty years and find that there are something like ten principles of learning that are very worthwhile for supervisory purposes . Interns do need to be given guidance and guidelines to perform at the highest level possible . These guidelines might well be called principles of learning , devised from the psychology of education ( Ediger , 1994 ) . Principles of Learning and the Intern <p> First , the intern needs to be given assistance to provide meaningful learning opportunities for pupils in the public schools . To possess meaning , pupils should be able to say in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils indicate that they understand what has been learned . Perhaps , the indicator here should also stress other than verbal ways to reveal what has been learned . Howard Gardner ( 1993 ) has identified nine intelligences , also called Multiple Intelligences ( MI ) . Thus there are the following ways that interns should realize that pupils may indicate learning that have been acquired . These intelligences are : verbal/linguistic , logical/mathematical , visual/spatial , musical , bodily/kinesthetic , nature and the natural world , the human condition , interpersonal , and intrapersonal . For example , pupils taught might reveal learnings through any of these nine intelligences . Thus instead of showing learnings through interpersonal means ( committee work ) , the pupil may wish to work alone ( intrapersonal approaches ) . Or , instead of indicating what has been learned through oral approaches ( verbal/linguistic ) , the learner might wish to reveal what has been learned through an art project ( visual , spatial ) . The method chosen by pupils to reveal learnings acquired might well depend upon a preferred intelligence , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a meaningful way for a pupil to show what has been achieved . <p> Second , the intern needs to provide interesting learning opportunities to pupils . These learning opportunities capture the interests of students . Attention is then given to the activity/experience provided by the intern . Interest in learning is a powerful factor in having pupils achieve as well as possible . With careful planning , the intern might well capture pupil attention through interesting activities being presented , the pupil and the curriculum have then become one , not separate entities . With interest in learning , the pupil can better concentrate on the presentations being offered by the intern . A variety of learning opportunities has a better chance of obtaining learner interests as compared to a single or a few activities ( Ediger , Elementary Education , 1996 ) . <p> Third , the intern needs to guide pupils to perceive purpose in learning . With purpose , reasons are accepted by the pupil for participating in ongoing activities . The accepted reasons for participating in the curriculum make for active involvement in learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the middle , and the end of each unit of study . If pupils are not attending to the lesson and unit being taught , they should be reminded of the purposes involved in learning at different intervals in the unit of study . <p> Fourth , quality sequence should be in the offing for pupils in ongoing lessons and units of study . With good sequence , previously acquired knowledge and skills provide readiness for new goals to be achieved . The sequence experienced by pupils makes for new goals to be achieved . The sequence experienced by pupils makes for increasingly more complex learnings for each pupil . Learners individually should experience optimum growth and achievement . In a logical sequence , the intern/cooperating teacher determine the order of objectives for pupil attainment . In a psychological sequence , the pupil orders his/her own experiences such as in individualized reading . Usually , there will be both logical as well as psychological experiences for pupils in the classroom setting . <p> If the new objective is excessively difficult to attain , frustration on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequential objective is too easy to achieve , boredom might well set in on the part of the learner . By observing and learning as much as possible about each learner in the classroom , the intern might well provide better sequence in learning . <p> Fifth , problem solving skills need to be developed by pupils . Problem solving is important presently in school as well as in society . With problem solving stressed in all curriculum areas , the intern must set the stage for this type of learning . Thus , pupils perceive a need for problem identification . A problem is then developed by the learner individually or within a collaborative setting . The problem needs to possess clarity so solutions can be found . After the problem is clear to learners , information should be found in terms of securing answers . A variety of reading and audiovisual aids needs to be used as information sources . Also , it is vital for pupils to use modern technology in information gathering . The answer to the problem is tentative , not final , The tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Problem solving certainly emphasizes higher levels of cognition as a skill . This is a challenging kind of learning experience for which pupils put forth mush effort since they identified the problem and went through the flexible steps with intern/cooperating teacher assistance . Generally with interest and purpose in a problem area identified , pupils will carry out the tasks to completion , even though difficulties are involved ( Smith , 1996 ) . <p> Sixth , critical thinking is important to emphasize in ongoing lessons and units of study . With critical thought , pupils are encouraged to make comparisons and contrasts in information obtained . Pupils should also analyze fact from opinion , accurate from inaccurate statements as well as reality from fantasy . Critical thinking is important for learners in many ways . Here , the pupil sorts out what is good , true , and beautiful from that which tends to be the opposite , such as drug abuse , alcoholism , physical abuse among other forms of abuse , and unwholesome sexual relations . Worthy contributions to the self without self destructive behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of all . <p> Seventh , pupils need assistance by the intern/cooperating teacher to stress pupils engaging in creative thinking . With creative thought , pupils come up with novel ideas , unique to the self . These ideas are attempts to close gaps in knowledge and skills possessed . Improvements certainly do come about due to creative minds and endeavors . When changes are made from what is to what should be , someone or some group has been creative in thinking to close gaps . Originality of thought , not conformity , emphasizes creativity . <p> Eighth , The intern not only should develop interests of learners in a new unit of study , but also maintain involved interests . Many interns find it difficult to assist pupils to maintain interests in the learning opportunities provided . The best bet here is for the intern to provide a variety of learning activities for pupils . There are many opportunities for pupils to learn from . These include incorporating diverse reading materials , computers , internet , E-mail , videotapes , filmstrips , slides , cassettes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With a variety of learning opportunities used in each unit of study taught , pupils may find those which assist in providing for individual talents , interests , and abilities . Each pupil should be assisted to achieve as optimally as possible . Interpersonal and intrapersonal development are equally important . Pupils individually should achieve well in the academic , social , emotional , and physical arenas . These area of growth need to be reflected in the different learning opportunities provided for pupils . <p> Ninth , the intern should assist pupils to use the community in learning . There are excellent learning opportunities in using excursions to link the school and the community . School and community should not be isolated from each other . Pupils are in school presently and later on will be working in a work place . It is good presently to stress pupils being an integral part of society . Pupils also need to become worthy members of and contribute in the societal arenas . Organizations such as 4H , Girls Scouts , Boy Scouts , Campfire Girls , among other wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increasingly so , as they progress through the sequential levels of schooling ( Ediger , Journal of Instructional Psychology , 1996 . <p> Tenth , pupils need to become responsible individuals . The home and school need to work together for the good of the pupil to achieve more optimally . Which are selected areas of responsibility for pupils to achieve in ? Homework assignments made by the intern/cooperating teacher need to be completed by pupils . If pupils do not understand what to do in homework assignments , they should ask questions so that responsible behavior is in evidence . An appropriate place to study should be in the offing . The home and the school should have conferences frequently so that the pupil may build on past experiences and attain relevant objectives . In the home setting , there are numerous responsibilities for pupils to be involved in such as keeping their own rooms neat , clean and tidy . Conclusion <p> It is important for interns to use desired principles of learning from the psychology of education . These guidelines provide direction and guidance in selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should achieve more optimally as a result . <p> Interns/cooperating teachers who are well prepared for each lesson and unit taught should fare well in the instructional arena . Pupils who do not do well should have their work diagnosed to determine the cause(s) for a lack of progress . Specific reasons for a lack of pupil progress are then noticed . A new strategy of instruction should be in the offing . Learners need to be challenged to attain as much as individual abilities permit ( See Ediger , 1997 ) . <p> 
@@4007841 The relationship between the Supreme Court and the press has been but a footnote in scholarly analysis of political institutions and the press . Some explanations for that neglect are obvious . Press coverage of the Court is meager , particularly compared to that of Congress or the president. ( n1 ) Moreover , the limited coverage that the Court receives is often criticized as inadequate and superficial. ( n2 ) News coverage tends to be driven by journalistic values rather than legal salience. ( n3 ) Given the scant and often superficial coverage , the lack of scholarly interest is understandable . <p> Yet such elementary explanations fail to address the important question of whether the Court seeks a relationship with the press . The obvious answer would be negative . But is that the correct answer ? <p> It is widely assumed that the Court has little interest in the press and public opinion because its only constituency is the legal profession . Such a view implies that the Court has no need or desire to communicate with the press . But Larry Berkson has identified two separate constituencies of the Supreme Court : the legal profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but more important portion of the general public. ( n4 ) This second , more subtle constituency is the base of power for the Court . <p> In Federalist 78 , Alexander Hamilton argued that because the Court lacks the power of either sword or purse , it is the branch of government least likely to injure : " It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL , but merely judgment . " ( n5 ) Without formal constitutional powers , the Court is potentially weak . It should rightly fear that the president , Congress , and the states will not comply with its decisions unless it can assert some authority that they will respect . " The only power that the Court can assert is the power of public opinion. ( n6 ) To succeed , the Court must have the support of the general public . The Court has even acknowledged that need . In carefully formulating its decision in the controversial abortion case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the Court 's legitimacy is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n7 ) <p> To promote public respect for itself and its decisions , the Supreme Court attempts to project images of expertise , unanimity , and independence . <p> The image of expertise appears in the mystical trappings of the Court , with its robes and rituals , and in the backgrounds of its justices , which suggest the distance of an intellectual , if not social , aristocracy . Unlike other politicians , justices are expected to occupy a social and educational level above that of most citizens. ( n8 ) <p> The image of unanimity is cultivated particularly when the Court 's power is under attack from other institutions . Examples of the Court 's tendency to close ranks when its power is threatened can be seen in the unanimous decisions in the civil rights cases Brown v. Board of Education and Cooper v. Aaron , wherein state governments challenged the authority of the Court , and in U.S. v. Nixon , wherein the president threatened to ignore the Court 's ruling . The intent of the Court to encourage public compliance through its united opinion is hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other justices , urging that the Brown opinion be " short , readable by the lay public , nonrhetorical , unemotional , and , above all , not accusatory. " ( n9 ) <p> The image of the Court 's independence is acquired by creating the perception of distance from , and immunity to , the political process . The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is made possible by its nonelective status . However , the image requires cultivation . As the Court itself admitted in a well-known opinion , its " authority -- possessed of neither the purse nor sword -- ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction . Such feeling must be nourished by the Court 's complete detachment , in fact and in appearance , from political entanglements. " ( n10 ) <p> Thus the Court must interact with the public to sense what it must do to maintain public confidence and transmit appropriate messages to its most important constituency . But it lacks the mechanisms that enable other political actors to hear from and speak to their publics , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town meetings . The Court needs an information conduit , and that conduit is the press . In this model , the role of the press -- based on the Court 's need to maintain its power by maintaining public deference to its decisions -- is to cultivate a positive image of the Court . <p> The potential effect of the press in promoting the needs of the Court is enormous because the public generally knows little about the Court or its actions . Though a few major decisions may penetrate mass awareness through saturation media coverage , most do not . Sometimes even the groups most affected by decisions of the Court are unaware of them . For example , a mid-1970s survey of Florida high school teachers showed that only 17 percent were aware of the Engel v. Vitale decision , which disallowed school prayer. ( n11 ) One prominent political researcher concluded : " Citizens , as individuals , evince little or no knowledge of or concern for the Court ; to the extent that they express sensible opinions , they base judgments on the vaguest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The justices recognize the importance of the press in disseminating the views of the Court to the public . Earl Warren acknowledged the relationship when he wrote that the issues handled by the Court should be " well understood and intelligently appraised by the public . Since the public can not be expected to read the opinions themselves , it must depend on newspapers , periodicals , radio , and television for its information . " ( n13 ) In 1956 , referring to a news clipping , Justice Harold H. Burton wrote to Warren , " This shows that the opinion is being understood and taken as it was intended to be taken -- at least by the writer of this editorial . " ( n14 ) And in 1966 Earl Warren wrote to a reporter that he was " pleased beyond words " with the reporter 's coverage of the Miranda decision. ( n15 ) <p> There is ample evidence that the justices pay close attention to the press not just when important decisions are at stake but on a regular basis -- with particular concern for how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC News , related a conversation with Justice Scalia in which Scalia made specific comments about his stories . Stuart Taylor , of American Lawyer magazine , received congratulatory personal notes from Justices Brennan , Powell , and O'Connor after writing profiles of them. ( n16 ) <p> The justices also take an interest in negative stories . Chief Justice Burger once called news correspondent Fred Graham to his chambers to complain about a story Graham had done for the CBS Evening News. ( n17 ) And Justice William O. Douglas wrote a scathing letter in response to a Washington Post story about the Court ; though he decided not to send it , it can be found in his papers . It reads in part : " It is amazing how little the press knows about Supreme Court procedures . A country paper that we read at Goose Prairie can be excused , but not the Washington Post , whose editors could find someone to give them a seminar on judicial procedure any time they choose . " ( n18 ) Later , in his autobiography , Douglas called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their editorial pages as " a club by the publisher against the Court . " ( n19 ) Douglas and Burger were not alone in their anger . A biographer of Justice Abe Fortas wrote that Fortas held a " hatred of the press , " and that he called reporters " dirty " and " crooked . " ( n20 ) The attitudes of Burger , Fortas , and Douglas show that justices are quite concerned about how their efforts are covered . <p> Despite recognizing the press as a conveyer of their views and images to the public , the justices rarely acknowledge that the influence flows both ways . When asked in an interview what influence public opinion has on justices ' opinions , Justice William Brennan replied emphatically , " None . " ( n21 ) Yet the justices at least notice the political world around them . Justice Scalia wrote in his concurring opinion in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services : <p> We can now look forward to at least another Term with carts full of mail from the public , and streets full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been awarded those extraordinary , undemocratic characteristics precisely in order that we might follow the law despite the popular will -- to follow the popular will. ( n22 ) <p> Whereas Scalia admitted to noticing expressions of public opinion , Chief Justice William Rehnquist more explicitly acknowledged its possible effect in a 1986 speech , before his elevation to chief justice : <p> Judges , so long as they are relatively normal human beings can no more escape being influenced by public opinion in the long run than can people working at other jobs . And if a judge on coming to the bench were to decide to hermetically seal himself off from all manifestations of public opinion , he would accomplish very little ; he would not be influenced by current public opinion , but instead by the state of public opinion at the time that he came onto the bench. ( n23 ) <p> And one justice admitted in a background interview that public opinion may at least influence the Court 's agenda : " People just demand that the Supreme Court resolve an issue whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us sometimes . " ( n24 ) <p> Though justices may deny acting with the press or the public in mind , their conduct suggests otherwise . The Court released its initial decision on the constitutional protection of flag burning during the week of Flag Day . Conveniently , the Court scheduled the oral arguments for , and delivered its decisions on , both the Webster and Casey abortion cases on the last days of their respective terms , thus minimizing the impact on the Court of public demonstrations and press reactions while it was still in session . <p> These anecdotal observations are bolstered by a systematic study by David G. Barnum , who concluded that the major Court actions of the 1960s on minority rights were prompted by public opinion and that the Court was unwilling to act in areas such as busing and legalization of homosexuality where their decisions would be antimajoritarian. ( n25 ) <p> Though the Court must be responsive to public will to achieve deference to its decisions and maintain its power , it must not appear to be responsive to public opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaken its power . Thus a paradox exists for the justices ' conduct -- they must engage in image making while denying that they do so . They resolve the paradox by actively cultivating an image of aloofness . <p> An example of that self-conscious aloofness was related by Tony Mauro , a reporter for USA Today : <p> We had a reception at the press room for Justice Souter .... When a justice comes onto the court ... we invite all the justices down for wine and cheese .... At the very end of it , Souter turned to us and said , " Well , thank you for this . I enjoyed it . Let 's do it again when I retire . " We realized as he walked away that you just do n't see them much . Once they get life tenure , they tend to get inaccessible -- until they 're old and they want to adjust their obituaries. ( n26 ) <p> Other justices may not find such brush-offs so easy , but they too work on the image . Stuart Taylor made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most interesting of the justices because he is a ball of energy . He writes very forceful opinions . He does the same in oral argument . On the other hand , he does n't want to be a public figure , he 's very conscious of that . When he 's giving a speech , he does n't want to be televised . He does n't want anyone from the press to cover it . When he 's making a speech somewhere if he sees a television camera , he 'll go off stage and say " I 'm not going back on until that camera is gone . " The explanation he gives is that he does n't think Supreme Court justices should be public figures , out on the hustings making arguments . He ca n't resist doing it ; he just does n't want the image of what he 's doing widely disseminated . I think there was an element that some of the other justices felt he was getting a lot of attention , he was hotdogging too much and so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a certain tension between his urge to assert himself and his desire not to be perceived as asserting himself in certain ways . ( 111 ) <p> In addition to cultivating respect through an image of aloofness , justices sometimes actively engage the press to accomplish other ends , such as protecting their personal images . Justices Harry Blackmun and William Rehnquist have granted interviews specifically to correct what they considered mistaken views of their personalities ( 106 ) . Other justices , for example William Brennan and Byron White , have punished the press by cutting off reporters when they felt they were treated unfairly ; however , after years of silence Brennan embraced the press near the end of his tenure , when his power on the Court was waning ( 106-7 ) . <p> A second reason that justices engage the press is to acquire external assistance in internal disputes . Justices sometimes use press interactions and public speeches to express their views to sympathetic audiences and criticize colleagues or other officials ( 106-9 ) . But the more common avenue for such expressions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which serve no authoritative function within the legal system , are designed to gain attention for a particular justice 's view outside the Court . Dissents are much more likely to be reported than concurrences , probably because of the inherent drama of conflict. ( n27 ) The number of such individual expressions by justices has increased over time . The Burger Court produced four times as many dissents and ten times as many concurrences as did the Hughes Court in the same amount of time . The extreme number of individual opinions in recent years caused David O'Brien to conclude that " individual opinions are more highly prized than the opinions of the Court . " ( n28 ) <p> A third motive of the justices in press interactions is to affect the larger political environment as it touches the Court . They sometimes even participate in the public debate on nominees . Justice Stevens publicly endorsed the nomination of Robert Bork to the Court , and Justice Thurgood Marshall publicly questioned the nomination of David Souter because he had never heard of him. ( n29 ) In 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press concerning original intent and judicial activism. ( n30 ) <p> Thus the Court has an active but often subtle or hidden relationship with the press . That relationship is essential for individual justices in reaching personal objectives and for the Court as a whole in maintaining its power . To more fully understand the relationship it is helpful to examine the mechanics of reporting on the Supreme Court beat . COVERING THE COURT <p> Approximately fifty reporters are assigned to the Supreme Court . Twelve to fifteen work full time on the Court ; the rest cover other subjects as well . The Court beat is high in prestige because of its proximity to power but low in satisfaction because of the need to rely on documents and the paucity of interviews with sources. ( n31 ) <p> Many journalists are general assignment reporters and move from beat to beat ; Supreme Court reporters are unique in their stability . In a survey of Court reporters half said they had been on the beat for more than six years. ( n32 ) Longevity is an advantage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accumulate expertise . <p> Another distinguishing characteristic of the Court beat is the legal background of many reporters . Some legal training is the norm among Court regulars , several of whom have law degrees . Legal training helps reporters to understand Court processes and communicate with legal experts as sources . <p> The sporadic nature of press coverage of the Court often relegates its reporters to the fringes of the journalistic community . " Face time " -- time on the air -- tends to be lower for broadcast reporters covering the Court than for other broadcast reporters . However , a few Court regulars , such as Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio , Tony Mauro of USA Today , Lyle Denniston of the Baltimore Sun , and Tim O'Brien of ABC News , have become media personalities , who deliver speeches about the Court and are even interviewed as experts on the Court . <p> At the beginning of each term reporters select from the Court 's " Order List " ( cases accepted for oral argument in that term ) a small number of newsworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters also read through the many requests for hearing , called certiorari petitions , to target key cases as early as possible . One reporter commented that " an increasing portion of my effort went into sifting through the Supreme Court docket in search of whiz-bang fact situations that might make it on the Court 's agenda . " ( n33 ) <p> Television imposes additional limits on story choice and coverage . Tim O'Brien explained : " One of my stories , if it runs a minute-forty ... that might be one column in a newspaper . Barely a column .... We ca n't be as comprehensive as you can in a newspaper simply because we do not have the time . " ( n34 ) <p> Broadcast journalists present Court stories as human dramas . In covering a case about victim impact statements , Tim O'Brien traveled to Memphis to interview the family of a woman and her daughter who were stabbed to death . The late Toni House , public information officer for the Court , observed that " what television is able to do is put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . They go out and put the people who were involved on camera . " ( n35 ) <p> Wire service reporters work under even greater constraints because in most cases they file their stories first . One estimated that he spent three minutes reviewing a decision before filing the lead and thirty minutes before filing the whole story. ( n36 ) Early wire stories shape the framing of stories by other reporters . Those cues become particularly important when a Court decision is complex and its implications may be unclear . <p> Reporters can cover a Supreme Court case at three stages : when the certiorari petition is submitted , when oral arguments are made , and when the decision is handed down . Oral arguments often provide the best opportunity to show conflict and introduce an issue , but as they lack finality and tend to be technical and dry , they can easily be neglected in anticipation of the decision . One reporter lamented : " Sometimes I come out of an oral argument with hardly a quotable quote . " ( n37 ) Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments can help the reporter to understand the issues and may reveal the attitudes of justices , hinting at the coming decision . <p> When a decision is announced the Court 's public information office immediately distributes the opinions in printed form. ( n38 ) At that point , reporters must read and begin to interpret the decision . <p> Interpretation is facilitated by extensive preparation . Court reporters spend the bulk of their time reading documents related to cases . Frank Aukofer of the Milwaukee Journal explained : <p> Most of the stuff that you need is right there at the Court-you have read the briefs , the amicus briefs . There is n't much need to go out and interview anybody . Sometimes to personalize it , to make a better story out of it , I will go out and talk to the people involved or talk to their lawyers . On a big case , when you have 20-30 amicus briefs , you pretty much get the gist of what 's going on from the documentation at the Court . It 's a nice , comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there right in front of you. ( n39 ) <p> Because primary sources such as certiorari petitions and briefs are readily available to reporters , the decisions and the reasoning behind them are not usually a surprise for those who cover the Court. ( n40 ) <p> Even with months of preparation , however , decision reading can be difficult . Carl Stern observed , " They 've got too many clerks , so they write these horrendously long law review articles for decisions .... The plain fact is that Supreme Court decisions today look like the periodic tables in chemistry . " ( n41 ) New York Times reporter Linda Greenhouse wrote : " I see myself as a kind of translator . " ( n42 ) In filling that role reporters need help , and they often rely on each other . <p> Supreme Court reporters operate in a competitive but collegial atmosphere . They compare notes after oral arguments and decisions. ( n43 ) As Carl Stern explained : <p> You can not go to the principal actors and ask them what they meant . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put our heads together and kind of ask each other , " What do you think it means ? " ... I ca n't think of any press operation that I 've experienced or did experience in almost thirty-four years of journalism that was as collegial as the Supreme Court press room . ( 19,42 ) <p> One part-time Court reporter observed that the regulars are important to reporters like him because " once in a while you get a complex decision with no clear majority . Then I would talk it over with some of my colleagues who would have covered the case more closely . " ( n44 ) <p> Another solution to the problem of interpretation , as the justices themselves refuse to clarify their written opinions , is to consult outside sources . Many interest groups happily volunteer to interpret decisions and their implications . Some , such as the ACLU , keep offices near the Court building for easy access to news conferences immediately after decisions . Others , such as the National Organization for Women , the Legal Defense Fund , and the Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , area to inform reporters of their positions on upcoming cases . <p> Competition to serve as sources for Court stories is intense among interest groups . Their representatives mill about the Supreme Court plaza after decisions , hoping to share their spin with reporters . Elite reporters avoid the plaza and let the groups chase them . One reporter related that " people are falling all over themselves to offer you information , offering stories , offering access to major players . " Linda Greenhouse commented : " I do n't make too many phone calls . People call me " ( 87 ) . The most sought-after sources are more likely to return a call to an elite reporter . <p> Reporters also turn to academic experts . The Court reporters surveyed said legal experts were their most frequent source ( 86 ) . Pundits such as Lawrence Tribe and Arthur Miller , of Harvard Law School , are famous as sources , not only because they are experts but because they are quick to return calls and good at translating Court decisions into lay terms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true particularly when one party is an interest group or the U.S. government . Another source is counsel in the case , who usually are willing to speak to the press . <p> Reporters keep lists of willing sources , categorized by issue . The choice of sources is often influenced by accessibility . One reporter admitted that his sources were " people you can get through to " ( 86 ) . Reporters often solicit strong rhetoric in an attempt to get a good quote . One news magazine reporter said , " I try to get a key quote to illuminate the issue -- a quote that is funny , or sexy , or unusual , or in a slightly offbeat way illuminates the case " ( 90 ) . Experts who best meet the sound bite imperative are the most likely to be used again . Thus stories about the Court often focus more on reactions to decisions than on the decisions themselves. ( n45 ) <p> Two-thirds of the Court journalists surveyed said that their editor 's influence was important in their work. ( n46 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories out first , they affect the approach of editors to their reporters ' stories. ( n47 ) Editors rely on those reports to monitor their reporters ' story choices and use information from the wire in negotiating the length and angle of stories . If the approach of a non-elite reporter differs from that on the wire it is likely to be challenged by the editor , and the reporter will bear the burden of proof . <p> Editors exert control over the content of Court stories . Two-thirds of the reporters surveyed said that their editors want stories changed to better explain technical points . " ( n48 ) Under editorial influence , many reporters omit much of the reasoning behind decisions because they consider it beyond their audience . Carl Stern found that approach frustrating : <p> Any words I used to describe the Court 's reasoning were rejected as beyond the understanding of the average Joe . Analogies were usually substituted from sports or warfare .... There 's many a time ... that I took ... if not a verbatim quote at least the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer to change this or that . And I would say , " But that 's not what he said " and they would say , " well that 's what he really meant . " And I would say , " No , that 's not what he meant , and that 's not correct . " And then it came down to , " Do you want to get on the air tonight or do n't you want to get on the air tonight ? " ( n49 ) THE CONTENT OF COURT COVERAGE <p> Another wrinkle in the reporter 's job is the decreasing space and time devoted to Court stories . News organizations are forcing reporters to explain the Court with more brevity . Lyle Denniston , a long-time Supreme Court reporter for the Baltimore Sun , observed that in the mid-1980s he was given 28 to 30 inches of column space for a story , but by the mid-1990s he was receiving only 16 inches . The shrinkage of coverage has affected not only newspapers but television as well . Using data from the Vanderbilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time devoted to the Court had dropped from 3.9 percent to 2.4 percent over a five-year period . The Court received an average of 26 minutes per month in 1990-91 but only 8 minutes in 1994-95. ( n50 ) <p> The decline in attention to the Court reflects the media 's emphasis on newsworthiness . Decisions that survive the filtering process must reflect news values. ( n51 ) Only those that involve drama and conflict and seem proximate to the lives of viewers are covered . In Lyle Denniston 's words , a story is newsworthy if it is " an object of contemporary fascination . " ( n52 ) Media critic James Fallows observed : " Get the ratings and you 're forgiven all else . The sin there is not being inaccurate . The sin is being boring . " ( n53 ) Indeed , it can be argued that Court " proceedings are so dull that it is a public service to keep them off the tube . " ( n54 ) <p> The Court itself may have contributed to the decline in interest . The Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desegregation , obscenity , and abortion , but the Rehnquist Court has been more restrained . Its restraint may be as much a matter of subject opportunity as of judicial choice . Lyle Denniston explained : <p> There is no such thing anymore ... as a landmark precedent-setting decision like Brown or ... Roe v. Wade . The salami is sliced thinner and thinner and thinner . In trying to cover a First Amendment case now you almost have to be a Talmudic scholar to slice the difference between the dogmatic principles the Court is going to follow. ( n55 ) <p> Another factor that discourages press coverage is the justices ' aversion to personal stories . Stories about the Court are rarely about personalities , scandals , or the institution -- they are about the cases . In 1989-90 , 74 percent of network Court stories were about cases on the current docket . By 1994 the figure had risen to 84 percent ( 167 ) . Exceptions to docket-centered coverage are resignations and confirmations of justices ( 167-68 ) . <p> The quest for newsworthiness produces a distorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Court dominated by social policy issues " to the exclusion of other types of cases . " ( n56 ) Associated Press coverage during 1989-90 varied according to case content . First Amendment and civil rights cases were overreported in relation to their percentage of the docket ; cases involving judicial power , federalism , and the economy were underreported. ( n57 ) <p> Furthermore , what coverage there is of Court decisions tends to be superficial . Slotnick and Segal found that only 26.7 percent of the stories about Webster referred to the fact that a Missouri law was being challenged , and that " a full 45 percent of Bakke stories Regents of University of California v. Bakke lacked specific content about the nature of Bakke 's claim or the factual scenario underlying it . " ( n58 ) Slotnick and Segal concluded that reporting on the Webster and Bakke decisions was " relatively ahistorical and acontextual " ( 104-5 ) . <p> Glossing over the details is not the only shortcoming of Court reporting . Justices are rarely mentioned by name ( 182 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible in the coverage of Bakke and Webster ( 154 ) . A content analysis of Court stories spanning 1984 to 1989 revealed that only one-third of Time magazine stories and one-fifth of CBS stories mentioned a justice by name. ( n59 ) Moreover , the justices ' votes in particular cases are rarely reported . Slotnick and Segal found that in 1989 the votes of the justices were reported by the networks in about half the cases . By 1994 such reports almost never occurred. ( n60 ) In fact , interest groups were noted by name more often in Court stories than were the authors of Court opinions ( 183-84 ) . <p> A striking example of selectiveness and inaccuracy can be seen in the press coverage of certiorari petitions . In coding decisions for their 1989-90 study of network Court coverage , Slotnick and Segal found expansive coverage of merit decisions that they could not locate on the docket , and later they learned that those phantom decisions were actually certiorari denials ( 197 ) . Very few certiorari denials were reported by the networks in 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reported dealt with abortion , equal protection , and privacy ( 201 ) . In the 1989 term , 48.3 percent of reports about certiorari denial were mistakenly presented as merit decisions , 27.6 percent were presented ambiguously , and only 24.1 percent were reported accurately ( 199 ) . Court Public Information Officer Toni House said that the worst thing reporters do is to misrepresent certiorari denials , making them sound like decisions ( 190 ) . <p> In short , press coverage of the Court is minimal and superficial . Biases and mistakes in reporting present the public with a distorted view of the Court 's work . Given these realities , it is no wonder that the Court attempts to influence press coverage . THE INVISIBLE DANCE BETWEEN COURT AND PRESS <p> The Supreme Court justices lead the press in an invisible dance , restraining it with one hand while directing it with the other . Despite the lack of formal personal encounters , as in interviews and news conferences , justices and reporters interact regularly . <p> The justices shape press coverage by directing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their public appearances , by providing background information , by shutting off other points of access , and by avoiding issues of contention , focusing instead on minor matters such as working conditions . <p> Such efforts are not new . The Court began to institutionalize its relations with the press in the 1930s . In 1935 it opened a Public Information Office with a Court employee designated to help the press. ( n61 ) In 1947 the Court appointed a full-time public information officer . The Court deliberately avoids terms such as " press secretary " or " press office . " Although the Public Information Office deals primarily with the press , the title implies that it simply gives information to the public , without acknowledging the press as the obvious conduit of that information . <p> In other branches of the federal government a press secretary provides advice on how policy will play with the public , but the Court 's public information officer does not so advise . Toni House said , " My job is peculiar in Washington because this office does n't spin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our job is to put the news media together with the information that they need to cover the Court . " ( n62 ) The Public Information Office provides official information , available to the general public as well as to the press , and nothing more , thus reinforcing the Court 's message that it is unconcerned with politics . Referring to crank calls and advocacy mail , House remarked , " People do n't realize we the Court do n't care what they think . " ( n63 ) Former Time reporter Jerome Carter said that the Supreme Court is " the only beat in the federal government where if you ask them a question they stare at you and say , ' That 's your job . I 'm not here to do that . ' " ( n64 ) <p> Despite these seeming barriers , as an institution the Court says a lot to the press -- in official documents . The number of certiorari petitions , Court orders , briefs , and opinions that a reporter is expected to know about is astounding . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spent 50 percent of his time reading the four thousand certiorari petitions filed each year. ( n65 ) By feeding the press an almost overwhelming volume of documents , the Court focuses press attention on the justices ' work product . Most news stories about the Court simply cover the content of the justices ' opinions. ( n66 ) <p> But the justices realize that their written communications may not tell the whole story . Hence they interact with reporters in other settings . Regular reporters on the beat occasionally are granted off-the-record interviews . The justices prefer such settings , where they can direct the press without appearing to . They bind the press to maintain the perception that the justices do not interact -- as the price for the interaction . <p> They usually refuse to discuss current cases , and reporters know better than to ask . But the justices do discuss their roles in past decisions and offer insight on the Court 's inner machinations . Only three of the Court journalists surveyed said that they had never had an off-the-record interview with a justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justices ; two reported such interviews with every current justice . Two-thirds said they had been granted off-the-record interviews in every term. ( n67 ) <p> The justices both provide information and limit it . The clerks who serve the justices each term are potentially valuable news sources because they are privy to the Court 's handling of current cases . However , the justices prevent leaks . Clerks are warned not to talk to reporters and are teased about the " twenty-second rule " -- that if they talk to a reporter they will be fired within twenty seconds. ( n68 ) <p> Even when leaks occur , the justices can discredit them by simply altering their plans . Tim O'Brien remarked that the Court can " make you look foolish if you say decision on such and such day .... The Court does n't like it when someone announces their decision before they do . " ( n69 ) Because the Court eventually goes public with its decisions , some reporters say it is not worth the risk of reporting a leak that might be wrong or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough at plugging leaks that reporters do not expect them . Without reliable alternative sources , reporters simply wait for the Court to speak -- through its written opinions . <p> The extent to which the justices care about Court press is evident in their efforts to facilitate accurate coverage . In addition to providing a press room and issuing opinions promptly , and other measures designed to accommodate the press , they sometimes alter their procedures to help reporters get the story right . For example , when Carl Stem told Chief Justice Burger that he had misreported a decision on the air ( thinking it had been the reverse decision ) , Burger ordered that clarifying headnotes be attached to the decision. ( n70 ) The Court changed its former policy of not announcing scheduled decision days after reporters complained that they did not know when to come to the Court to hear decisions . The announcements still do not indicate which decisions will be released. ( n71 ) The Court also changed its policy of delivering all opinions on Mondays , after lobbying from reporters to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred when the Court realized that too many decisions were going unreported because of its unpredictable schedule and excessive volume on a single day . <p> Although the Court has occasionally made changes to assist the press , the changes have always been designed so that the Court benefits in more accurate and more extensive press coverage of its written work . Future changes will surely be of the same character , or they will not be instituted by the Court . <p> Reporters ' responses to the Court 's handling of the press vary . Some reporters chafe at the procedures ; others support them . One reporter defended the tactics of the Court by saying : <p> It 's the one institution set up to defend minority rights . It 's the only one that really depends totally on popular will . It does n't have the power of the purse strings ; it has no army . To demystify it , to start covering the bickerings of the justices in their private meetings -- it might lower the Court 's esteem in the eyes of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , then it wo n't remain an institution very long , even though it 's provided for in the Constitution . <p> So I 'm not all that upset with the way it operates . I 'm almost in agreement with them that it should n't be televised . I 'd love to sit in on a Friday afternoon conference , or I 'd love to be able to buttonhole the justices in the hall and find out who 's sticking it to who . I 'd love to do those kinds of stories . But I 'm not sure it would be so good for the institution. ( n73 ) OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH <p> Many facets of the interaction between justices and reporters remain unexplored by scholars . Particularly scarce are studies on justices ' motives for interacting with reporters , even in background interviews . Why do justices go public at times and not at other times ? <p> A historical analysis is needed to help us understand whether Court-press interactions have increased over time , under what circumstances they are likely to occur , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such interactions weaken the Court by exposing the justices to press notice , or do they strengthen the Court by enhancing public understanding and appreciation of that unique institution ? We have determined that the Court and the press are engaged in a dance . But we could learn much more about how they dance and why . <p>
