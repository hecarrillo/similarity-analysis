@@4021341 Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) is a connective tissue disease characterized by widespread vascular lesions . Primary myocardial involvement is common in SSc and , when clinically evident , appears as a poor prognostic factor . Using conventional methods , myocardial perfusion impairment and biventricular dysfunction have been reported in SSc . Recently , Tissue Doppler Imaging ( TDI ) echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging have confirmed these results . TDI , with its derived strain , strain rate and myocardial performance index , is a powerful new echocardiographic tool that is now becoming the standard for assessing ventricular function in a variety of situations and diseases . In the present article we review the main published data on the application of TDI in the evaluation of cardiac function and prediction of prognosis in patients with SSc . <p> Keywords : Systemic sclerosis ; Echocardiography ; Tissue Doppler imaging ; Strain and strain rate imaging ; Myocardial performance index Introduction <p> Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) is a multisystem disorder characterized by diffuse vascular lesions and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs 1 2 . Cardiac involvement is a common finding in SSc , but often clinically occult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in 20-25% of patients with SSc , while at postmortem examination the heart is affected in up to 80% of patients 3 4 . The course and prognosis are highly dependent on the clinical pattern , and the main causes of death are cardiovascular , renal and pulmonary disease . Heart involvement is one of the main factors shortening the survival of SSc patients 5 . Although cardiac abnormalities could be more prevalent and severe in the diffuse cutaneous subtype of the disease , there is increasing evidence suggesting that cardiac involvement is also a frequent finding in the limited cutaneous subtype . In the large epidemiological Italian study , although heart symptoms were found more frequently in the diffuse form ( 32% ) as compared with the limited form ( 23% ) , the difference was not statistically significant 6 . Some data have even suggested a more prevalent involvement in the limited subtype of the disease 7 . <p> Magnetic resonance imaging , single photon emission computed tomography , echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography have been used to investigate myocardial perfusion and contractility . The data showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysfunction were common . Moreover , echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography may be influenced by loading conditions and adjacent segment motion 8 9 . Tissue Doppler Imaging ( TDI ) has been introduced as a quantitative , more objective , and sensitive method for the assessment of myocardial function . It is a new approach that allows direct and valid measurement of myocardial velocities and strain rate 10 11 . Myocardial strain rate has been shown to be a strong index of contractility , independent of myocardial translation and less dependent on loading conditions . Furthermore , strain rate determined by TDI is a more sensitive method than conventional echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography for detecting changes in myocardium contractility 12 13 14 . The myocardial performance index has been considered a good predictor for adverse results in several cardiac diseases , such as valvular insufficiency , cardiomyopathies and acute myocardial infarction . It is easy to obtain , however , using TDI to obtain myocardial performance index ( representing regional systolic and diastolic function ) is not a universally accepted method 15 16 17 . <p> Based on these grounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationale behind and clinical use of TDI , strain rate and myocardial performance index in the assessment cardiac function , prediction of prognosis and distinguishing cutaneous subtypes in patients with SSc , and their relation to other instrumental features of the disease , with focus on recent developments ( Table 1 ) . <p> These techniques provide accurate information about segmental myocardial motion and deformation during the cardiac cycle and offer the advantage , with respect to conventional Doppler echocardiography , of assessing systolic and diastolic function of both the ventricles at a regional level 12 13 14 . A highlight on the use of TDI in the assessment of myocardial function Right ventricular function <p> The early detection of right ventricular dysfunction may be important in clinical practice . However , this issue has not been sufficiently investigated by non-invasive techniques because of right ventricular complex geometry which hinders an accurate assessment of right ventricular internal chamber dimensions and their changes during the cardiac cycle 23 . Lindqvist et al focused on right ventricular diastolic function in 26 consecutive SSc patients compared with 25 matched controls ; TDI showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p<0.001 ) in SSc patients with no significant changes regarding right ventricular systolic function 23 . Another study revealed that the tricuspid annular isovolumic relaxation time ( p=0.001 ) and the tricuspid E/E ratio ( p=0.04 ) were significantly increased in 22 SSc patients compared with the 22 healthy volunteers 22 . D'Andrea et al showed that TDI analysis detected impaired myocardial right ventricular early-diastolic peak velocities ( P<0.0001 ) and prolonged myocardial time intervals at tricuspid annulus in 23 SSc patients 21 . Finally , in a recent study of 40 consecutive SSc patients compared with 45 matched controls , the subclinical right ventricular dysfunction was more common than predicted . Fifty-five % of the patients had right ventricular systolic dysfunction ( right ventricular ejection fraction <40% ) , and TDI uncovered that peak myocardial systolic velocity ( p<0.001 ) as well as early and late diastolic velocities were prolonged ( p=0.01 and 0.05 respectively ) 20 . Left ventricular function <p> Previous studies using conventional measurements have reported low prevalence of systolic dysfunction and variable alteration in diastolic function in SSc . However , left ventricular ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 . A study of 19 SSc women pointed out that early diastolic velocities were significantly lower ( p<0.00001 ) in comparison to 16 control healthy women . Also , the detailed assessment of diastolic function in the SSc group showed severe diastolic dysfunction of longitudinal myocardial fibers with normal function of circumflex myocardial fibers 4 . Another study found that mitral annular isovolumic relaxation time was significantly increased ( p=0.03 ) in SSc patients 22 . D'Andrea et al showed that the myocardial early diastolic wave /myocardial atrial diastolic wave ratio was significantly lower ( p<0.01 ) in SSc patients compared with the control group while Hsiao et al showed similar TDI parameters between the 2 groups 20 21 . Atrial Conduction <p> Can et al studied 24 SSc patients and 24 control subjects . There was a delay between the onset of the P wave on surface electrocardiogram and the onset of the late diastolic wave in SSc patients measured at lateral septal annulus ( p=0.001 ) , septal mitral annulus ( p = 0.01 ) and tricuspid annulus ( p = 0.05 ) . Interatrial conduction time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are significantly higher in SSs patients with delay in both intraatrial and interatrial electromechanical coupling intervals 18 . <p> Therefore , it appears that in progressive SSc , myocardial dysfunction is common and detailed screening of cardiac function in SSc patients with TDI is warranted for early detection of abnormalities . Strain and Strain rate derived TDI in the detection of myocardial abnormalities <p> Strain rate imaging has been recently developed to measure regional velocity gradients . This technique overcomes several limitations inherent in measuring regional velocity profiles , because it is not influenced by global cardiac displacement and the tethering effects of adjacent segments 26 . Meune et al detected that SSc patients had lower systolic strain rate ( p<0.0001 ) and lower diastolic strain rate ( p=0.0004 ) than controls ; 10/17 SSc patients had reduced systolic strain rate and 11/17 patients had reduced diastolic strain rate despite normal LV ejection fraction 24 . D'Andrea et al perceived that peak systolic strain rate and strain were both reduced in the basal , middle and apical right ventricular lateral free walls , and in the basal and middle LV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospectively evaluated 18 patients with SSc without clinical heart failure and with normal pulmonary arterial systolic pressure . TDI was assessed at baseline , after a 72 hour vasodilator washout period , and after 14 days of oral treatment with nifedipine . Nifedipine treatment led to a significant increase in the magnetic resonance imaging perfusion index ( p = 0.0003 ) and in systolic and diastolic strain rate ( p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0003 , respectively ) 25 . Similar findings were discovered in 18 SSc patients with lower systolic and diastolic strain rate in comparison with 15 healthy subjects . Median peak systolic strain rate was markedly improved ( p=0.0002 ) after bosentan treatment . Bosentan also significantly increased the median peak early diastolic strain rate function ( p=0.0003 ) 19 . To sum up , Strain and strain rate are respective markers of regional contractility and diastolic function . Myocardial performance index as a surrogate of myocardial performance <p> The myocardial performance index assesses the global functions of the ventricles and is not influenced by factors such as pre and after-load 22 . Hsiao et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventricular function . The myocardial performance index of the right ventricle in patients with SSc was much higher than in control subjects ( p<0.0001 ) . Furthermore , the difference in myocardial performance index between control and SSc groups was more prominent in the right ventricle and septum than in the LV lateral wall 20 . TDI as a predictor of prognosis and outcome <p> As most of the work in TDI has been diagnostic in nature , there has been a great interest in the prognostic implications of TDI diastolic variables . Lindqvist et al noticed a significant correlation between forced vital capacity/ Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity and isovolumic relaxation time/R-R time interval ( r = 0.44 , p < 0.05 ) . These findings appear to be early markers of right ventricular disturbance , probably in response to intermittent pulmonary arterial hypertension 23 . D'Andrea et al pointed out an independent inverse association of right ventricular peak early-diastolic velocity with both Rodnan Skin Score 1 27 ( p<0.0005 ) and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure ( p<0.0001 ) , as well as independent inverse correlation of the same right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , right ventricular peak early-diastolic velocity was an independent predictor of the anti Scl-70 antibody pattern ( p<0.001 ) . Those findings indicate how the right ventricular dysfunction in SSc occurs concomitantly with the pulmonary hypertension and skin involvement . They may also valuable to distinguish patients with a more aggressive and diffuse form of the disease 21 . Hsiao et al uncovered that right ventricular - myocardial systolic velocity <11 cm/s indicated right ventricular ejection fraction < 40% with sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 86% . In addition , right ventricular - myocardial systolic velocity <12 cm/s was associated with more frequent hospital admission . They assumed that the myocardium surrounding the right ventricle can be used to predict the hospital readmission rate of patients with SSc 20 . Finally , Allanore et al and Vignaux et al demonstrated the strikingly beneficial short term myocardial effects of both nifedipine and bosentan in patients with SSc determined by magnetic resonance imaging and TDI 19 25 . Application of TDI in distinguishing the cutaneous subtypes <p> Although cardiac abnormalities could be more prevalent and severe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement is also a frequent finding in the limited subtype 28 . Plazak et al and Vignaux et al showed no significant difference between the diffuse ( 42% and 56% respectively ) and limited ( 58% and 44% respectively ) subtypes 4 25 . In the study by Meune et al , patients with diffuse SSc ( 47% ) had reduced mean forced vital capacity ( p = 0.006 ) and mean Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity / hemoglobin ( p = 0.03 ) when compared with limited subtype ( 53% ) , but there was no difference regarding thallium perfusion score , LV ejection fraction , echocardiographic parameters and TDI values 24 . Another study encountered that patients with the limited subtype ( 60% ) were older with longer disease duration . Patients with diffuse SSc ( 40% ) had lower forced vital capacity and Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity with higher pulmonary arterial systolic pressure . The TDI parameters were similar except for the myocardial performance index of the right ventricle ( lower in diffuse SSc , p = 0.03 ) in both forms . Patients with diffuse SSc had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these studies may represent the severity of heart involvement which was nearly equal regardless of subtype presumably due to the high prevalence of myocardial dysfunction in both SSc subtypes . Conclusions <p> The present review proposes that pulsed TDI , which is far more sensitive than conventional techniques , is a valuable non-invasive and easy-repeatable tool for detecting early myocardial involvement , predicting the prognosis and for follow-up in patients with SSc . There is a high prevalence of abnormal myocardial systolic and diastolic function in SSc patients , despite normal global ejection fraction of both ventricles . Another important clinical implication is that biventricular function should be studied in detail in patients with SSc . Detection of abnormalities in diastolic function might provide a means of identifying patients at risk for progressive heart failure . There was a high prevalence of myocardial dysfunction of both SSc forms . Finally , there was a strikingly beneficial short term myocardial effect of vasodilators in patients with SSc . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Table 1 : Baseline characteristics <p> 
@@4070941 Standards organizations historically use a consensus approach to develop new technologies . But in the modernization of a key pressure vessel code , the objective of consensus-building took on an expanded scope . <p> The newest version of one of ASME 's pressure vessel codes , known as Section VIII , Division 2 , has been updated not only in its content , but also in the organization and presentation of the information it contains . What 's more , the method by which the new edition was developed differed in many ways from earlier practice . The new VIII-2 , which becomes mandatory on July 1 , may serve as a model for future standards development . <p> Before the project to rewrite the Section VIII , Division 2 pressure vessel code began , an ASME committee of industry veterans surveyed potential users in the petrochemical and manufacturing industries to build consensus on what these target users wanted . " Make the code more user-friendly " was one of the top requests . <p> In a business environment where modern technology serves up an abundance of information on illuminated screens , industry experts increasingly believe that userfriendly presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their active use . The survey results confirmed that not only do users demand the latest technology innovation , but also a structure that makes the standard easy to use and understand . <p> " We had no choice if we were to develop a worldclass pressure vessel design code that would exceed our customers ' needs , " said Louis Hayden , ASME 's vice president of Pressure Technology Codes and Standards , who served as project manager for the rewrite . " To be blunt , the standard was difficult to use , particularly for early-career engineers . We needed to start from scratch after reviewing pressure vessel codes from around the world . " <p> The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code was first published in 1915 , and the initial edition of the Unfired Pressure Vessel Code , Division 1 , was distributed in 1925 . As far back as the 1960s , it was recognized that the special requirements for design of pressure vessels operating at pressures over 2,000 psi ( 13.7 MPa ) called for special rules , and ASME issued Section VIII , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These codes have been actively maintained and updated by a dedicated group of volunteers , but it was becoming difficult to work within the older format . The increased understanding of failure mechanisms and advances in material science , nondestructive testing , and computeraided design have progressed to the stage where a new approach was needed not only in the content of design codes , but in the way they are presented and organized . <p> By doing a clean-sheet rewrite , the standard has been modernized not only with the latest technical advances in pressure vessel construction , but also in a structure that is friendly for both users and the committees that maintain it . <p> L : International Pressure International codes and corporate engineering practices had demonstrated with over 30 years of operating experience that a lower design margin , along with advanced engineering practices , resulted in safe pressure vessel construction . With a design margin of 3.0 , the old Section VIII , Division 2 was not commercially competitive with European standards . In the new edition of VIII-2 , the design margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old VIII-2 required a lot of extra and unnecessary analysis , and was not very cost effective . <p> According to Tom Pastor , Hartford Steam Boiler vice president and chair of the ASME Subcommittee on Pressure Vessels that authorized the rewrite , " Senior volunteers felt it was time to turn our attention to VIII-2 . VIII-2 was not a heavily used standard , and thus it was not kept up to date at the same pace as VIII-1 . " <p> Traditionally , the development of new standards by ASME is carried out by volunteer committees . The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee consists of a volunteer manpower base of about 800 engineers . But experience with previous new code or rewrite activities demonstrated that the volunteer manpower base did not have enough industry-sponsored time to finish the project quickly and efficiently . The last major standard developed completely by volunteers was Section VIII , Division 3 , for vessels operating at pressures above 10,000 psi , which took nearly 15 years to complete . <p> The Section VIII , Division 2 code applies to vessels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Accomplishing this using only the volunteer manpower base would have detracted significantly from the quality of the new code and added significantly to the required development costs and time by a factor of two or more , " said Guido Karcher , who chaired the Board on Pressure Technology Codes and Standards from 2005 to 2008 , the ASME board responsible for the rewrite process . " Even with such a resource , it would have been necessary to provide an overall project management activity to coordinate volunteer reviews and consistency between the reviewing efforts . " <p> With the development of a European pressure code , waiting 15 or more years for a needed update to Section VIII , Division 2 was not an option , so ASME decided to use an outside organization to develop the first draft of the new standard . The project was awarded to the Pressure Vessel Research Council ( PVRC ) , which in turn formed the Task Group on Continued Modernization of Codes to oversee development . PVRC then engaged the Equity Engineering Group as the lead investigator , editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Japan Steel Works ' Web site shows the plan of construction for a pressure vessel built at its Muroran Plant . <p> A steering committee made up of ASME Section VIII members was formed to provide technical oversight and direction to the development team , with the goal of facilitating the eventual balloting and approval process . ASME also hired a project manager to coordinate the activities required to bring the new standard to publication . <p> Numerous international groups have written standards covering pressure equipment . The most important are the European Committee for Standardization , or CEN , which has 30 national members , and the International Standards Organization , a non-government organization that builds consensus through a network of national standards from more than 150 countries . The developers of the new Division 2 code believe it enables ASME to maintain a pre-eminent position in pressure vessel technology globally , because it advances design practices beyond standing CEN and ISO codes . <p> " The new Division 2 provides for many of the longstanding accreditation and design practices that are not in the CEN or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides for a more efficient and adaptable code for international use via the new recognitions of engineering certifications outside of the U.S.A. and Canada . " <p> L : Feedback Before Publication The rewrite of Section VIII , Division 2 broke new ground for ASME in several areas , from hiring a project manager to publishing the document in single columns and formatting it to satisfy ISO guidelines . Also , the project team initiated two other activities to ensure both high quality and acceptance of the Division 2 rewrite : a validation of all design rules , and beta testing of the document . <p> The new Division 2 contains hundreds of equations and polynomial expressions for curve fits used in the design rules . Even where rules were taken from Section VIII , Division 1 , they were rewritten in most cases to facilitate computerization . The net result was that to check each equation , figure , and polynomial expression would have been a major undertaking . If volunteers were asked to perform this work , it would have delayed publication of the document . <p> Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software was contracted to assure the quality of the design rules . It performed this work by programming all the design rules in Mathcad and running numerous examples . Whenever possible , examples from the old VIII-2 and VIII-1 were used for the validation work . In all , over a thousand pages of calculations were performed and the process did identify some errors , mostly in the equations used to model design curves . This validation work will serve as the starting point for an examples manual to be developed for future publication . <p> Everyone on the Division 2 project team was interested in receiving feedback from users , and normally this feedback is received once a standard is published and used for production vessels . This time , however , it was decided to test the standard prior to publication , during the last stages of approval . Invitations to participate were sent to several Division 2 certificate holders , who were asked to select a recently completed Division 2 vessel and re-execute the project on paper using the new standard . A large number of interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel to be used in the evaluation . <p> The beta test provided validation of many of the goals set forth when the project was initiated . As expected , significant cost savings were reported due to the increase in allowable stress for many carbon and low-alloy steels . Of equal importance , most of the testers also reported a reduced amount of reinforcement required for openings resulting in a reduction in forged nozzle thickness . <p> All the beta testers reported the standard was easy to use and that the design rules were clear and concise . Many said they prefer the new format of the document . <p> Early in the project , developers surveyed code users , including vessel users , manufacturers , and regulatory organizations . According to Karcher , " These responses were used as building blocks in the new Division 2 . Some resulting examples are the use of non-North American professional engineers , a more comprehensive and better focused user design specification , single column ISO numbering and format . " <p> After publication , surveys were conducted to assess the new code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , and the U.S. According to Hayden , " Attendees were surveyed as to their likes and dislikes of the new code . Their input has been factored into addenda and plans for continued publication of this code in its current format . " <p> L : Extended Transition Originally published in 2007 , the new Section VIII , Division 2 was to become mandatory Jan. 1 , 2008 . A code case was approved ( Code Case 2575 ) that allows for an 18-month transition period during which VIII-2 certificate holders will be able to construct to either the old VIII-2 ( 2004 edition through 2006 addenda ) or the new VIII-2 . The transition period ends July 1 this year , when the new edition will become the only one in effect . <p> ASME is offering training seminars for the new code at locations around the world . As user communities are identified , ASME has also set up international interest groups that can nominate engineers for delegate membership in the ASME code committees of interest . These delegates may participate by attending meetings , teleconferencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers can visit the ASME Web site at www.asme.org for more details on these programs . <p> From the first polling of users to its publication in July 2007 , the revamping of VIII-2 took six years . <p> Would ASME use this development process again ? " I believe the answer is yes , " Pastor said . " Times have changed such that the number of volunteers , and more importantly , the number of volunteer hours donated to ASME continue to reduce each year , so that large projects such as the Division 2 rewrite will need to be directlv funded as R &D."; <p> And what may be the next step ? Karcher said , " Looking to the future , the predicted evolutionary process would be a rewrite of Division 1 to address so-called simple pressure vessels , and a merging of Division 2 and Division 3 to benefit from the advanced technologies and to avoid the burdening of the small and mass produced pressure vessel industries with unnecessarily complex and tedious construction requirements . " <p> This might take some time and more pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users want one pressure vessel code , and ASME would be more than happy to give it to them , but it is not that easy . Pressure equipment is ordered based on regulatory requirements , price , manufacturer 's experience with a standard , and the like . " <p> Hayden sees the new document setting a standard for code development . " I believe that the development of the 2007 edition of Section VIII , Division 2 is a bellwether of things to come from ASME , " he said . " The development process , leading edge technical content , and use of user input/feedback in developing this code have set the standard for new code development activities at ASME . The staff and volunteers have seen what can be accomplished and are willing and ready to use this model for future codes and standards development . " <p> The developers believe that a completely new and more user-friendly organizational structure to the Section VIII , Division 2 pressure vessel code , coupled with adoption of the latest technology available for the construction of pressure vessels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other industries for decades to come . <p> " The new Division 2 provides for many of the longstanding accreditation and design practices that are not in other international codes . <p> " Volunteer hours donated to ASME continue to reduce each year , so that large projects such as the Division 2 rewrite will need to be directly funded as R &D."; <p> By David A.

Technology heightens the learning experience by providing an opportunity for active student participation in understanding and interpreting the environment ( Thompson et al . 1992 ) . <p> Using an educator 's perspective , this paper compares two computer audit software packages available on the market - Audit Command Language ( ACL ) and Interactive Data Extraction and Analysis ( IDEA ) . In Section II , we discuss several reasons why an educator might adopt audit software in an accounting course .

In Section IV , we describe how the authors and instructors at other universities incorporate the packages into their curriculum . This section also provides student feedback , pedagogical suggestions , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer keys , and other resources . The paper concludes with an overall evaluation of ACL and IDEA . II . WHY USE AUDIT SOFTWARE ? <p> Given that the accounting curriculum seems to expand endlessly , why would an instructor consider adding an audit software package to his or her course ? Teaching students the " tools of the trade " makes them more aware of current practice and therefore more marketable . Accounting students typically get exposure to other technological tools of the trade such as spreadsheets , accounting packages , database software , and online research resources ( Bain et al . 2002 ) . Incorporating audit software into the curriculum helps complete this toolkit and prepares students for the content of the computer-based Uniform CPA exam . Moreover , using audit software can help students develop high-order cognitive skills because it encourages them to actively participate in applying theory to real-life situations . Audit software activities become more relevant , allowing students to gain a better understanding of the software and studied environment ( Hakeem 2001 ; Thompson et al . 1992 ) . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Accounting Profession <p> Professional organizations have developed professional standards and guidance to help auditors evaluate electronic evidence and advance toward continuous auditing . In 1998 , the Information Systems Audit and Control Association ( ISACA ) established an audit guideline specifically addressing the use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques or CAATs ( ISACA 1998 ) . In 1999 , the AICPA and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ( CICA ) published a joint research report identifying six preconditions necessary for continuous auditing , including auditor proficiency in information technology ( IT ) and the system ( CICA 1999 ) . In 2001 , the AICPA issued SAS No. 94 to warn auditors that a substantive-only audit approach may not be feasible in complex IT environments ( AICPA 2001 ) . <p> The AICPA recognizes the role that IT plays in educating future accountants , stating , " All professional accountants , irrespective of their primary work domain or role , must acquire both relevant theoretical knowledge and practical IT skills " ( AICPA 1996 , para . 12 ) . Incorporating technology such as generalized audit software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit practices ( Nieschwietz et al . 2002 ) that can be used for any audit requiring data extraction and analysis . Accounting firms and internal auditing functions are increasingly utilizing GAS because of its user-friendly interfaces and its ability to quickly examine 100 percent of a population ( Lanza 1998 ; Sayana 2003 ) . GAS efficiently performs many manual procedures , allowing auditors to focus on understanding clients ' businesses and creating more value for the client ( Lanza 1998 ) . <p> Larger firms initially used internally developed GAS programs that required specialized programming knowledge . As the storage and processing capabilities of PCs have increased , firms have generally abandoned the proprietary GAS programs in favor of commercial GAS programs , which do not require any programming knowledge ( Warner 1998 ) . GAS is used by hundreds of organizations across the world , including all Big 4 accounting firms , hundreds of governmental agencies , and almost all of the Fortune 100 firms ( ACL Services Ltd 2004 ) . Moreover , almost 50 percent of internal auditors report using GAS in their operations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAS in practice , together with its user-friendly interface , makes it a serious candidate for inclusion in courses such as accounting information systems , auditing , and information systems auditing . Audit Software as a Learning Mechanism <p> Horsfield ( 1995 ) suggests that auditing students should understand the following three areas : audit theory , the relationship between audit theory and audit practice , and current audit techniques . Unfortunately , traditional audit classes do not provide students with concrete experience ( Siegel et al . 1997 ) . Incorporating audit software into the audit curriculum can reinforce students ' understanding of audit concepts ( Nieschwietz et al . 2002 ) . In terms of Bloom 's ( 1956 ) taxonomy , instructors can use audit software as a learning mechanism to move students from knowledge and comprehension of audit concepts to application of those concepts , and with well-designed instructional cases , perhaps to analysis , synthesis , and evaluation of audit problems . Specifically , using audit software in conjunction with comprehensive audit cases can develop strategic and critical thinking skills ( Gelinas et al . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " link data , knowledge , and insight to provide quality advice for strategic decision making " ( AICPA 1999 , 17 ) . <p> Bryant and Hunton ( 2000 ) note that research addressing educational technology in the accounting discipline is not as well developed as in the pure educational research realm . The most recent accounting research into education technology is descriptive rather than empirical and focuses on distance learning and hypermedia ( Bryant and Hunton 2000 ) . Thus , research has not empirically shown the value of incorporating audit software into the accounting curriculum . In the last two years , accounting education journals have included a small number of instructional cases using audit software ( e.g. , Gelinas et al . 2001 ; Nieschwietz et al . 2002 ) . Gelinas et al . ( 2001 ) report that their students agree or strongly agree that using the audit software supplemented their understanding of risk and audit procedures ( 72 percent ) and helped them understand the use of technology in auditing ( 91 percent ) .

OVERVIEW AND COMPARISON OF ACL AND IDEA <p> ACL and IDEA are the most common commercial GAS packages ( McCollum and Salierno 2003 ) . Both external and internal auditors use these packages for data extraction , data analysis , and fraud detection/prevention . This section presents comparisons of functional and pedagogical features of ACL and IDEA . Training Manuals <p> Both products offer self-guided training manuals : ACL for Windows 7.0 Workbook ( ACL Services , Ltd. 2002 ; hereafter ACL Workbook ) and IDEA 2002 Workbook ( Audimation Services , Inc. 2002 ; hereafter IDEA Workbook ) . The training manuals include data sets , click-by-click instructions , and screen shots of command results . However , the training manuals are not educational textbooks ; thus they do not include certain pedagogical features such as discussion questions , additional exercises/problems , or conceptual material . The ACL Workbook is over 400 pages long and is organized by audit task . Users proceed through a series of lessons organized into nine modules .

The first five modules cover the basic functionality of ACL , while the last four modules cover more advanced functions ( see Table 1 ) .

Users proceed through five sections , with the middle three sections devoted to accounts receivable , accounts payable , and inventory , respectively ( see Table 2 ) . Functionality <p> Both ACL and IDEA provide a broad spectrum of data analysis and extraction functions . Users can easily sort , summarize , stratify , age , and calculate data statistics . Users can extract records by setting data filters . Both software packages also permit the selection and evaluation of samples using a number of methods . Users can examine files for duplicates , gaps , and proper sequences . The packages allow the comparison of multiple files , creation of new files , customization of reports , and documentation of audit tasks in several different ways . Users can also save commands in batches for repeated use . Table 3 compares ACL and IDEA software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive in their functionality . Fraud Detection <p> McCollum and Salierno ( 2003 ) report that 51 percent of internal auditors surveyed use software , including ACL and IDEA , to detect fraud. 1 The IDEA Workbook devotes an entire chapter to using IDEA to detect fraud , making it easy to incorporate fraud into the curriculum . Section 3 of the IDEA Workbook has students complete an audit and fraud investigation for accounts payable . The IDEA Workbook explains how fraud is committed in accounts payable , outlines needed audit tests , and then requires students to complete a series of exercises designed to uncover fraud . Though the ACL Workbook provides only limited reference to using ACL for fraud detection , ACL and IDEA both provide similar fraud detection capabilities . Examples of tasks that can be applied in a fraud detection context include stratifications , extractions , duplicate key detections , joining of databases , and application of Benford 's Law . Pedagogical Logistics <p> Instructors obtain the ACL Workbook by joining the ACL Education Partners Program. 2 A demo version of ACL 7.0 accompanies the Workbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 Students purchase the ACL Workbook and software either directly from ACL ( list $50 ) or via the bookstore ( volume discounts may be available ) . <p> Students must purchase the IDEA Workbook either from the instructor or via the bookstore ( $25 student price before bookstore markup ; retail $200 ) . Beginning in 2003 , the IDEA Workbook includes the training version of the software . Audimation provides the software to instructors through the Education Donation Program , which allows free installation of software and data files on campus lab stations. 4 , 5 Table 4 presents a comparison of the two packages ' logistics for educational purposes . IV . EXAMPLES OF CLASSROOM APPLICATIONS <p> This section illustrates how one may incorporate audit software into an accounting course . Recognizing that each course at each institution is unique , we briefly discuss how instructors at various universities are using the software packages . Hopefully these illustrations , coupled with a resource web page , will make it easier for the reader to incorporate the use of audit software in an appropriate course . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is teaching the basic features of the software . Completing these manuals in an academic course provides hands-on knowledge of how audit software looks , feels , and works . However , to have an enhanced learning experience , the student should apply this hands-on knowledge in completing additional tasks . The next section briefly describes how each author incorporates audit software into her course , discusses student feedback , and discloses how other universities are using audit software in accounting courses . We refer to a variety of course materials available online at http : **38;4388;TOOLONG . Some materials , like exam questions and answers , are password protected with user name = sobajis and password = jis . To help the reader , we identify the resources available on the web page with the following parenthetical notation : ( ACL or IDEA Resource 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) . The numbers correspond to the table of contents for the web page , which is reproduced in Table 5 . We will continue to update this web page with ( 1 ) additional materials submitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ACL change their software and corresponding training materials . Using ACL in the Classroom Illustration <p> ACL is used in a graduate-level , elective IS Auditing course at the University of Montana , a medium-sized ( 13,000 students ) public university . Undergraduate auditing is a prerequisite for this class . The ACL portion of the course spans five weeks , accounts for approximately 43 percent of the course points , and requires successful completion of two large ACL assignments ( eight training exercises and six application exercises ) ( ACL Resource 2 ) and an exam ( ACL Resource 5 ) . During this portion of the course , the class meets in a computer lab for approximately ten hours . <p> During the labs , students proceed at their own pace through the first five modules of the ACL Workbook , submitting various printouts from the practice exercises ( ACL Resource 2 ) for grading . Students complete these five training modules in 10 to 15 hours . At the beginning of the lab sessions , the instructor presents mini-lectures using slides ( ACL Resource 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize the important features of ACL . This is an opportunity to compare and contrast the various ACL commands . <p> In addition , the instructor leads the class in completing ungraded exercises ( ACL Resource 2 ) that provide additional practice with ACL . This is an opportunity for students to apply the mechanics of ACL while observing how the same task can be accomplished a number of ways . For example , there are at least three ways students can obtain a count and dollar amount of positive , negative , and zero balance items in a file . Doing this together in the lab allows students who approached it inefficiently to learn from students doing it more efficiently . More importantly , this provides an opportunity for the instructor to verbally introduce audit objectives that may be associated with each ACL task ( recall that the ACL Workbook is organized by task and not audit objective ) . Using the prior example , counting and obtaining positive , negative , and zero balances in an accounts receivable master file highlights credit balances that may need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts payable master file , it would highlight potential understatements ( zero balances ) as well as unusual balances . <p> After completing the first five ACL Workbook modules , students complete a series of graded exercises . These " application " exercises ( ACL Resource 2 ) require students to use the ACL Workbook data to apply what they have learned . In conjunction with completing many of these data manipulation and analysis tasks , students must note why the procedure might be performed in an audit , making the link between the ACL task and the management assertion that it examines . At the end of the semester , students complete an exam testing their ACL knowledge ( ACL Resource 5 ) . Student Feedback <p> Feedback on the ACL application in the course was provided in two formats in the last two administrations of the course , a survey specifically addressing the ACL project and the standard course evaluation form . Seventy-seven percent of students ( n = 35 ) agreed or strongly agreed that ACL helped them to understand what audit tests might be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them understand why audit tests might be done . Nearly all agreed or strongly agreed that ACL contributed to their learning experience ( 94 percent ) and they wanted to spend more time using ACL in this or other classes ( 86 percent ) . Feedback in comment form was uniformly positive , with no negative comments about ACL appearing on either the survey or course evaluations . The most consistent comment was that they benefited from the " hands-on " nature of using ACL , with some students specifically noting that it helped them apply what they had learned in this course and other courses . Using IDEA in the Classroom Illustration <p> IDEA was used in a senior-level , required Information Systems and Control course at Texas Christian University , a medium-sized ( 8,000 students ) private university . The IDEA portion of the course spans approximately three weeks and accounts for 13 percent of the course points earned by completing IDEA assignments ( IDEA Resource 2 ) and answering IDEA-related questions on an exam ( IDEA Resource 5 ) . During this portion of the course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students in this course have not yet completed an auditing course , so the IDEA project is preceded by one and one-half weeks of introduction to basic auditing concepts and CAATs . <p> Students proceed at their own pace through the first four sections of the IDEA Workbook . While the IDEA Workbook directs students to print out many screen prints/reports , the instructor designates a specific subset for them to submit for grading as part of the assignment . This assignment also requires students to answer questions based on the results of tasks completed in the IDEA Workbook . Students complete the first four sections and related questions in approximately seven hours . Each section first outlines potential audit tasks for designated audit objectives and provides a short audit program for the particular audit area . Because the IDEA Workbook is organized by audit area , most tasks are duplicated across the sections . Similar to the approach with ACL , the instructor reviews the important features of IDEA and focuses on how IDEA can be used to achieve audit objectives , using both in-class discussions and lectures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feedback on IDEA was obtained in the same manner as the feedback for ACL . Two-thirds of the students in the class ( n = 64 ) agreed or strongly agreed that IDEA contributed to the learning experience by helping them to both understand what audit tests might be done and why audit tests might be done . Fifty-seven percent of the students agreed that they wanted to spend more time using IDEA in this class or other classes . While the ratings did show large variation among students , responses were generally at the midpoint and more favorable end of the scale . <p> Examining student comments provides insights into successfully incorporating an audit software package into the class . Students liked the opportunity to use an audit software package that is used in industry . Given that the students had not previously taken auditing , using the software helped them relate to the overview of auditing included in this course . However , the timing of the project ( end of the semester ) was problematic . Students wanted more time to use the software . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in time . ) Also , several students commented on the inability to use the software outside the labs . Moreover , due to university restrictions , only one in-class lab was possible . More in-class labs would allow additional guidance to reduce the out-of-class completion times . Allowing students to complete exercises on their own computers would also increase students ' access to the software . In addition , the IDEA project was completed after manual and computerized accounting practice sets . This may have affected students ' perceptions of the IDEA project. 6 Suggestions for Instructors <p> While students are completing the ACL Workbook modules or IDEA Workbook sections , their focus is on the mechanics of the software . Because the ACL Workbook is not organized by audit area , the instructor should supplement the ACL Workbook with information on how the tasks can be associated with audit objectives in various audit areas . As noted above , the instructor can accomplish this verbally as students are learning the software mechanics or through mini-lectures . Regardless of the package chosen , the instructor should repeatedly ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software . For example , why would an auditor look for gaps or duplicates in numbering sequences ? Why would an auditor stratify items in a file ? Why would an auditor join a payroll file and an employee master file ? The extent to which instructors need to link software tasks with audit objectives and management assertions depends on the recency of students ' audit training , if any , prior to using the software . <p> Both ACL and IDEA have the ability to sample . The IDEA Workbook , however , covers only random record sampling . On the other hand , the A CL Workbook has a much more extensive coverage of sampling . While auditing classes may expose some students to sampling , often they do not calculate , select , and evaluate samples using statistical methods ( e.g. , MUS ) . When using statistical commands in ACL , the instructor should emphasize understanding statistical terminology , knowing which statistical applications are appropriate for which audit objectives , and interpreting ACL evaluation reports . Sampling is one of the more advanced applications of audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab time is key to the success of using either package . Students using ACL or IDEA are both learning a new software package ( e.g. , interface , commands ) and learning how to relate the commands to audit objectives . Support from both the instructor and other students in a classroom lab environment can greatly facilitate these learning processes . <p> Both the ACL Workbook and IDEA Workbook contain a number of minor errors or items needing clarification , which the instructors corrected via errata sheets ( ACL Resource 4 , IDEA Resource 4 ) . Most students have sufficient computer intuition to easily handle these corrections. 7 How Other Universities Use ACL and IDEA <p> Given the lack of instructional materials that accompany the software and the scarcity of a wide variety of cases published in academic journals , we solicited additional input from other instructors using ACL and IDEA . Using contacts obtained from ACL and Audimation ( the U.S. distributor of IDEA ) , as well as personal contacts , we emailed instructors regarding how they were currently using the software . Eight of 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IDEA users ( 38 percent ) responded to the qualitative survey. 8 Table 6 summarizes the qualitative responses , while the quantitative responses are discussed below . <p> Respondents use ACL ( IDEA ) more often in graduate ( undergraduate ) courses . The courses in which both ACL and IDEA are most often used are audit-related and both packages consume an average 14 percent ( 13 percent ) of the course schedule . Most respondents use the respective Workbook , but more ACL users have developed their own materials and datasets . The average time respondents had been using the software was 2.8 and 2.7 years for ACL and IDEA , respectively . <p> When asked why they selected the particular software package , the reason ACL users indicated most often ( 50 percent ) was that the package was an industry leader and widely used . IDEA users also cited this reason ( 27 percent ) , as well as free software ( 27 percent ) , ease of use ( 18 percent ) , and exposure to IDEA at a conference ( 18 percent ) as common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few respondents ( 13 percent for IDEA and 22 percent for ACL ) had technical problems with the software installation. 9 Table 6 describes the technical problems encountered . <p> Some respondents also provided the materials they used in their courses and course syllabi . We categorized syllabi resources by type of software , level of course , and focus of course and posted them on the ACL/IDEA resource web page ( ACL Resource 6 , IDEA Resource 6 ) . One respondent suggested a no-cost way of using IDEA . First , to learn the software features , students complete the Audimation " Getting Started Guide , " which instructors can copy . Next , students complete the Audimation Case study 2001 materials , which instructors can copy . Finally , students complete supplemental exercises provided by Nieschwietz et al . ( 2002 ) . Additional Methods for Implementing GAS in the Classroom <p> While a growing number of internal auditors are using ACL or IDEA to analyze audit data , over 50 percent still use Excelr or Accessr ( McCollum and Salierno 2003 ) . 10 Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Access to implement GAS and the associated concepts in the classroom . Several resources have been developed for Excel and Access . For example , Borthick et al . ( 2001 ) provide a case where students develop basic queries for an Access database containing automobile customers , makers , and dealer information . Assignment files and multiple choice questions are available on our accompanying website ( General Resource 1 ) . A second excellent resource is Computer-Assisted Auditing with Great Plains Dynamics ( Lehman 2003 ) . This workbook provides 15 step-by-step exercises that require students to , first , export selected data from Great Plains Dynamics , and to then , analyze them using Wordr , Excel , or Access . V. CONCLUSION <p> This paper is a case study of the use of two audit software packages in educational settings . Our goals are to provide examples as to how audit software might be included in courses , and , to provide insight into whether ACL , IDEA , or some other application would best suit students ' needs . Incorporating audit software into appropriate accounting courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and IDEA are both fully functional audit software packages that are easy to use . The primary differences between the educational versions of these packages are that the IDEA Workbook is organized around audit area and is shorter . Due to the organization of the IDEA Workbook and ease of use , IDEA may be better suited for undergraduate courses ; however , instructors may find less success with IDEA ( or any other GAS package ) in undergraduate courses crowded with other projects . <p> While both ACL and IDEA have education adopter programs that provide free software , they both lack additional educational materials . Two comprehensive cases have recently been published that include additional datasets : Gelinas et al . ( 2001 ) using ACL and Nieschwietz et al . ( 2002 ) using IDEA . This paper briefly describes how we use ACL and IDEA , including student feedback . More importantly , we have assembled numerous resources for educational adopters of ACL and IDEA on a resource web page , which we will continue to update with new information . <p> Finally , instructors must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . Its effectiveness depends on many factors , including time spent on the project , the students ' knowledge of auditing prior to the project , available in-class lab time , and the number of other projects students complete in the course . In addition , the nature of audit software assignments can range from training tasks to integrated cases . We hope the availability of these resources , coupled with our descriptions of the easy to use packages , will assist others in selecting appropriate audit software package for classroom use . <p> We gratefully acknowledge the feedback received from the associate editor , two anonymous reviewers , and participants at the 2002 AIS Educator 's Conference . Of the internal auditors using software to detect fraud , 47 percent use ACL and 6 percent use IDEA ( McCollum and Salierno 2003 ) . ACL made changes to its Education Partners Program in early 2004 . These changes are briefly described in the Appendix . Information on this program is detailed at http : **35;4428;TOOLONG . This site also contains links to material for anyone to download for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases detailing ACL in practice ) . Instructors should specifically request the ACL Workbook for 7.0 when joining the program , as this is no longer part of the program 's standard package . Instructors may also want to acquire the book CAATTs and Other Beasts for Auditors ( Coderre 2001a ) . For ACL materials on fraud , instructors may also want to acquire the Fraud Toolkit for ACL by Coderre ( 2001b ) . This book uses ACL batch code to perform eight categories of fraud detection tests , including completeness and integrity , cross-tabulation , duplicates , gaps , data profile , ratio analysis , and Benford 's Law analysis . One author installed ACL on individual lab machines and encountered no technical difficulties . Instructors wishing to install ACL to utilize network capabilities ( e.g. , file sharing ) should contact ACL for further information . One author installed IDEA on individual lab machines and encountered no technical difficulties . Instructors wishing to install IDEA to utilize network capabilities should contact IDEA for further information . Instructors making requests through the Education Donation Program also receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyright release for classroom use . The case study is also available for free download on the IDEA website . This conjecture is supported by written comments comparing the IDEA project to other course projects developed specifically for educational use . The instructor should be aware that copies of the ACL Workbook obtained at different times might have slight differences , most notably margin changes or minor corrections that , in turn , change page numbers . Page numbers in the 2002 book were one to three pages different compared to the 2001 book ( same title and version of ACL ) , a fact that was impossible to discover until the course began . This necessitated last minute corrections to all assignment sheets , instructor notes , and errata notes that referred to page numbers . Numbers of users surveyed does not reflect the number of instructors actually using the software . Neither ACL nor Audimation could provide a list of active users ; they could only provide a list of those participating in their educational programs . This survey was conducted prior to IDEA including the software in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged for students to legally use the software at home or used software accompanying a textbook . Currently , approximately 40 percent of internal auditors use ACL or IDEA for data extraction and analysis ( McCollum and Salierno 2003 ) .

@@4003041 Taiwan 's diplomatic stand in the global community has faced challenges since 1971 , when it lost its UN seat to the PRC ( People 's Republic of China ) . More and more countries shifted their official recognition from Taipei to Beijing , and fewer and fewer international organizations accepted Taiwan 's membership . By 1988 , countries having diplomatic ties with Taiwan numbered only twenty-two , the majority of them insignificant players in the international arena . Moreover , not all of them had full-fledged diplomatic missions in Taiwan . Although Taiwan 's total world trade volume went from $3.9 billion in 1971 to $39.5 billion in 1980 , fifty countries severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan during the same period . In 1989 , only 5 percent of Taiwan 's trade was with countries that officially recognized Taiwan. 1 Its official membership in international organizations in 1988 had declined to only eight international bodies. 2 These developments cast doubt on Taiwan 's continuing viability as an independent political entity . In order to break out of its diplomatic isolation , Taiwan has employed its economic strength to gain friendship , not only deepening interactions with friendly countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has beefed up this effort has been through the use of foreign aid . <p> This article focuses on Taiwan 's foreign aid policy since the late 1980s by examining the extent of its success and failure and investigating its scope , durability , and implications . How and where is this foreign aid delivered ? What is the limitation of this " dollar diplomacy , " as some Taiwanese politicians call it ? Is it designed to allay suffering and promote development in needy nations , or is it intended instead to serve the interests of the donor ? The findings will shed light not only on the utility of foreign aid in Taiwan 's diplomacy but also on Taiwan 's future status in the international community . <p> Information on Taiwan 's foreign aid has not been systematically documented and placed in the public domain . The government in Taiwan considers these statistical data and documentary sources to be sensitive and confidential and only discloses information selectively . This makes exhaustive evaluation impossible , but an examination of the available materials offers enough hints for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aid : Design and Implementation <p> There is no consensus regarding the definition of foreign aid . Some view it as including any flow of materials and financial resources , including grants , loan packages for which the interest is below the market rate , noncompensatory technical assistance , officially guaranteed credits , and reparation pay . Others regard foreign aid as only the transfer of resources on terms easier than those that could be obtained in the capital market. 3 Notwithstanding these various definitions , it is usually considered to be a transfer from the haves to the have-nots for the purpose of economic development , military security , and disaster relief and rehabilitation . <p> At one time or another , most industrialized countries have been donors of aid . The implementation of the Marshall Plan and the wooing of third world countries by foreign aid since the 1950s occurred within the context of the East-West confrontation . Likewise , in the 1950s and 1960s , the competition between mainland China and Taiwan for international recognition also led each of them to offer extensive foreign aid to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid was not only to isolate and diminish Taiwan 's international standing but also to pose as a third choice for developing countries by claiming a noble purpose of offering genuine help , unlike the exploitative intention of both the American capitalist imperialist and the Soviet socialist revisionist. 4 For Taiwan , the purpose of foreign aid was not to bid for a leadership role but to focus on survival by winning friendship and support for its legitimacy as an acceptable actor in world politics , particularly to ensure its UN seat. 5 By the 1970s , however , Taiwan was engaged in a losing battle with Beijing for diplomatic recognition as the legitimate government of the whole China. 6 <p> Most of the financing of Taiwan 's foreign aid programs before the late 1960s came from American surplus agricultural products sold in Taiwan . Even though the idea of aiding other developing countries was partially initiated by Taiwan , the money then was mostly from the United States. 7 The objective was to demonstrate Taiwan 's experience and was aimed at self-sufficiency , but the emphasis was on simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . By 1980 , over two thousand technicians from Taiwan had served in some fifty different countries , mostly African and Latin American countries having diplomatic ties with Taiwan . In contrast , because of its great financial resources and economic clout , Taiwan 's foreign aid program since the late 1980s has been more extensive than this early grass-roots approach . Technical and agricultural assistance projects are still part of aid projects , but financial loans , grants , and contributions to multilateral organizations have been added to the list of provisions . Although Taiwan 's foreign affairs have been less influenced than before by the United States after the latter withdrew its recognition in 1979 , its foreign aid policy indicates the trend of its increasing autonomy . Taiwan no longer needs to rely on U.S. financing to launch its aid efforts . <p> Taiwan 's foreign aid program rests in the decision-making process of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MOFA ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) . Two implementing arms are the Committee of International Technical Cooperation ( CITC ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The CITC was initially known as Operation Vanguard , established in 1961 to provide agricultural technical assistance to African and Latin American countries . The IECDF was created in 1988 with a five-year goal of allocating $1.2 billion in aid to friendly developing countries . Although the IECDF was set up by the MOEA and the official who is in charge of daily administration is the political vice-minister of the MOEA , the IECDF is ultimately steered by a seven-member cabinet-level council with representatives from various agencies. 8 Additional agencies and departments are called in whenever help is needed . For example , when the project involves agricultural assistance , the Taiwan provincial government 's Department of Agriculture and Forestry is consulted . When the aid is concerned with extending credit to foreign governments and the financing of outward investment , the Export-Import Bank ( Eximbank ) , a specialized government bank established in 1979 , is brought into the implementation process. 9 <p> Although the assumption is that both the MOFA and the MOEA hold joint jurisdiction over decision making , each ministry sees aid from a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic viewpoint , examining aid proposals carefully in order to ensure efficient and effective use of money . Without denying the necessity of wise planning of aid for the commercial interest and development needs of recipients , the MOFA is more concerned with aid as a diplomatic lever . Aid programs are sometimes employed as expedient political means to win diplomatic favors . The MOEA prefers a detailed and careful screening process , which might take more than a year ; the MOFA tends to favor a shorter period of deliberation for approval in order to take advantage of changing international circumstances or to sustain relationships with countries deemed " politically correct " and important to Taiwan . Most recipients of the MOFA 's aid are friendly countries , meaning that they either have recognized Taiwan or that they are willing to construct substantial relations without fear of Beijing 's reprisals . <p> In the 1991 fiscal year , the allocation for the IECDF was $48 million , and the CITC received $32 million . The MOFA budgeted $188 million for international activities , partly to be used for external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MOFA 's budget was completely dedicated to external aid and that this funding was used in its entirety , the total of the IECDF , CITC , and MOFA portions -- $268 million in all -- would account for 0.16 percent of Taiwan 's gross national product ( GNP ) . 10 Although it can not be determined if the scheduled budget has been spent completely due to the political sensitivity of some aid programs , and although it is clear that not every penny of the MOFA 's international budget was spent on external aid , a conservative estimate of Taiwan 's 1991 foreign aid spending would be about 0.1 percent of the GNP , less than that of the United States ( 0.15 percent ) in 1989 . Even so , in total dollars , Taiwan 's aid compares favorably with some OECD ( Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ) members such as Ireland and New Zealand and it is higher than that of most of the OPEC ( Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) countries. 11 In the 1992 fiscal year , the budget allocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 Who Gets What <p> Taiwan 's foreign aid covers six geographic areas ( Table 1 ) . In Latin America , Taiwan promised $10 million aid to Grenada and $50 million aid to Belize for housing and hydraulic power plant projects in 1989. 13 The amount of aid for Costa Rica and Panama totaled $16.8 million dollars in 1989-90. 14 In August 1991 , Taiwan 's vice-president made a highly publicized official visit to Costa Rica , Honduras , and Nicaragua , despite charges from the Taiwanese opposition party of buying friendship with aid pledges of millions of dollars to these countries. 15 <p> The arm of aid has also reached Africa , a target of Taiwan 's aid program since the 1960s , when Taiwan was competing with the PRC for UN membership and recognition . In the 1980s , Taiwan focused on regaining recognition from some previously friendly countries . Liberia received fifteen thousand tons of rice in 1988-89 to relieve its food shortage crises and then $212 million to cover road construction and educational improvement after its decision to normalize relations with Taiwan in 1989 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1991 , Nigeria was offered a $38 million aid package. 16 South Africa also received a $60 million low-interest loan in 1991 to provide black people in South Africa with technical and agricultural assistance. 17 <p> In 1989 , Papua New Guinea , a country in the Southern Pacific without official ties with Taiwan , agreed to exchange trade missions with Taiwan . This accord was reached after Taiwan 's pledge of $17.65 million in aid and occurred amid Beijing 's protests. 18 The year 1991 witnessed additional aid to Papua New Guinea as well as $710,000 to the Solomon Islands , which recognize Taiwan as a nation . <p> Delegations from Southeast Asia are likewise beating a path to Taipei for aid . Southeast Asia has been the top priority of Taiwan 's foreign aid programs because of its geographical closeness and recent economic vitality . In 1991 , for example , Indonesia and Thailand each received $1.7 million in aid to further so-called " substantive " relations. 19 The Taiwanese government has also begun to evaluate the possibility of a $15 million loan to Vietnam ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance to a proposed highway construction project in Vietnam. 20 <p> The latest aid effort in Taiwan 's " flexible diplomacy " is in the Baltic states and other republics of the defunct Soviet Union . The lECDF has included these countries in its list of states eligible for assistance. 21 Though the Baltic states have established relations with the PRC to win China 's crucial vote regarding their UN membership applications , they appear to have a strong sense of affinity toward the thriving capitalist economy of Taiwan . It has become a pattern for newly independent countries to establish diplomatic relations with China first to gain UN seats and then to develop relations with Taiwan later . The possibility of economic assistance , something more tangible than an economic model , led to exchanges of legations or consulates between Taiwan and Latvia , Estonia , and Lithuania . Ukraine also allowed the establishment of Taiwan 's trade representative office in Kiev with Taiwan 's promise of food assistance in return . Taiwan also focuses on technical assistance . For example , it has established a variety of training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments have given Taiwan an " official presence " in these countries , accompanied by limited diplomatic privileges and immunities. 22 <p> In cases where direct assistance has been politically inappropriate , Taiwan has employed a multilateral approach to aid . In Southeast Asia , for example , the IECDF appropriated $15 million in 1992 to the Asian Development Equity Fund , which is supported by the Asian Development Bank. 23 In addition , a $150 million donation was pledged in 1991 to the Central American Bank for Economic Integration to help needy countries in that region in the early 1990s . As a result , the bank revised its charter to allow Taiwan to join in as a non-regional member in 1992. 24 Moreover , the South Pacific Forum , a regional organization of 15 member states in the South Pacific , admitted Taiwan to be the eighth Dialogue Partner in 1992 for its annual Post-Forum Dialogue in order to request economic assistance from Taipei . It is noteworthy that only four member states of the Forum recognize Taiwan ( the other seven partners include the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the European Community ) . 25 <p> In dealing with cash-strained Eastern Europe , Taiwan has channeled aid through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development by promising a $10 million contribution to a special fund to help develop market oriented economies . A huge portion of the $10 million subscription will be loans to help republics of former Soviet Union and East European countries ; 20 percent of it will be used to advise Taiwan 's investors in Europe and help make related purchases from Taiwan . As of June 1992 , 90 percent of the fund had been used. 26 This gives Taiwan a link with an international financial organization , even though it is not qualified to join the bank because it is a non-European country and a non-IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) affiliate . In fiscal year 1992 , Taiwan 's contribution to the three regional banks -- the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the Asian Development Bank , and the Central American Bank -- totaled $32.5 million , accounting for 0.07 percent of the government 's budget. 27 <p> Taiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the international community . Amid the intensive pledge efforts to offset the costs of military operations in the Persian Gulf , Taiwan 's initial offer was about $100 million . Although it was not comparable to the amounts offered by Japan and Germany , Taiwan 's offer was larger than that of most other nations . For example , South Korea , which is larger in territorial size and population , responded with an offer of $50 million in cash and $70 million in goods and services over a two-year period . Even after the United States turned down Taiwan 's offer because of its concern with the PRC 's critical vote in the UN Security Council , Taiwan still pledged $30 million to the Middle Eastern countries hurt by the crisis. 28 All of this aid is on top of other humanitarian programs , for example , $20 million to Jordan to offset losses during the gulf crisis and $10 million to Kurdish refugees in Iraq. 29 <p> Several observations about Taiwan 's new aid efforts can be made . First , in all cases , Taiwan apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends " first break ties with China . Instead , Taiwan was willing to accept their dual recognition of both Chinas . Even if countries are not enthusiastic about the idea of diplomatic recognition , Taiwan is still willing to use aid to promote official contacts between countries . Accepting that some developing countries , particularly those in Southeast Asia , more or less realize China 's role and weight in their national security and regional stability , Taiwan 's expectation is not the acquisition of full-scale diplomatic ties but ( at least ) the establishment of official trade or representative offices under the name of " Taipei " or " Republic of China . " The mere existence of such an office helps Taiwan 's trade and investors in the host country . Moreover , official interaction signifies a breakthrough in diplomatic isolation , a beachhead for further development , and a change of international image . <p> Another example is Europe . Perhaps because of Taiwan 's recent aid programs , in combination with its trade and investment , European countries and the European Community have started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan since 1991 . Europe also accounts for 18 percent of Taiwan 's two-way trade in the early 1990s. 30 Reinharde Drifte once pointed out that in the early 1980s , Taiwan was considered only an object of trade and tourism , without any political leverage in East Asia or the international community . There seemed no way for Taiwan to circumvent its diplomatic isolation. 31 In the early 1990s , however , Taiwan 's image has undergone a significant change in Europe . <p> Second , aid and investment are apparently complementary to each other . In 1990 , Sam Shieh , the president of Taiwan 's Central Bank , estimated that Taiwan 's total outward investment might reach twelve to fifteen billion dollars. 32 Aid furthers the expansion of Taiwan 's outward investment , as clearly seen in its interaction with Southeast Asia . Given its geographical closeness and cultural affinity , Southeast Asia catches Taiwan 's eyes . In 1989 , Taiwan directly invested $1.96 billion , 11 percent more than in 1988 , in Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , and the Philippines . The total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986-1989 period was $4.1 billion , along with $15.9 billion in trade. 33 By 1991 , Taiwan had become the largest foreign investor in Vietnam , injecting more than $400 million into the Vietnamese economy . Vietnam also agreed to allow Taiwan to set up a trade representative office to protect the interests and rights of Taiwanese investors there. 34 <p> Aid and investment walk side by side in Latin America , too . In 1988 , the MOFA issued a special policy to encourage investment in this region . The program offers eligible projects a lower loan rate , a percentage of financing up to 80 percent of total investment , and an excellent deal in investment insurance. 35 Nevertheless , Latin America has remained a less attractive investment venue , from Taiwanese investors ' perspective , than Southeast Asia because of the latter 's cultural affinity and better work ethics . <p> Even so , experts from Taiwan provided managerial guidance for the establishment of export processing zones in Guatemala , Panama , and Costa Rica . For example , Taiwan paid most of the start-up costs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites and offering tax incentives . It is clear that this foreign aid was based as much on export need as on diplomacy : Taiwan was able to use these countries as duty-free launching pads to enter the U.S. market by taking the advantage of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative , which began in 1983 to assist export earnings of twenty-eight Caribbean and Latin American countries by offering trade benefits in the U.S. market. 36 As U.S. resistance to East Asian exports has grown , the idea of lending a hand to the establishment of export processing zones certainly has benefited Taiwan 's trade . <p> Third , though Taiwan 's aid has concentrated on Africa , Latin America , and Southeast Asia , South Asia and the Middle East have been relatively neglected , partly because of the lack of regular dialogue and substantial trade relations between Taiwan and some countries in these regions , partly because of the volatile political situation in the Middle East . Another reason may be that certain oil-producing countries have accumulated more than sufficient petrodollars . Upon a recipient 's request , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of technical and agricultural assistance . <p> Fourth , Taiwan is willing to adopt either the bilateral or multilateral approach to aid , as the situation requires . It seems to be to Taiwan 's advantage to engage in bilateral aid relations , which allow the recipient country to identify the donor more easily than in the case of multilateral aid packages . Such relations give Taiwan more discretionary power in negotiation as a donor and allow it to control the initiative . Even though no political strings are attached , indirect persuasion is at work . As long as give-and-take is established , Taiwan 's goal of " substantial diplomacy " has been partially fulfilled . <p> At times , the multilateral aid approach is employed , however , to reduce the political sensitivity incurred from bilateral aid . Moreover , when the organization in charge of the multilateral aid decides to accept Taiwan 's contribution , Taiwan sometimes acquires membership in order to participate in the management and governance of aid allocation . Even without such membership , the multilateral route establishes communication between Taiwan and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonding " capability , improves its chances of eventual membership in international organizations , and strengthens its claims as a de facto entity separate from the PRC . The Objectives of Taiwanese Aid <p> The political transition of 1986-1988 to a democratic regime , with the establishment of opposition parties and the lifting of martial law , freed Taiwan from its decades-long ideological stance of non-coexistence with the PRC . Though the principle of non-coexistence satisfied the self-justified sense of morality in rhetoric , it in effect entrapped Taiwan in a self-limiting situation without sufficient freedom to maneuver for creative diplomacy . The gradual thaw in domestic politics has been reflected in external relations . Pragmatism seems to be taking the lead in Taiwan 's foreign policy , and foreign aid seems to be an indispensable and effective tool to achieve one of its top foreign policy objectives : to win more international support , preferably official recognition , for Taiwan 's existence as an independent political entity and Taiwan 's participation in international organizations , thus warding off diplomatic isolation and deterring the PRC from taking drastic measures against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some mini-states with which Taiwan has no extensive trade or investment relationship at all . <p> This objective certainly can not be easily achieved . The PRC has consistently argued that Taiwan 's foreign aid policy is " silver-bullet diplomacy " to cloak its intention of establishing a " two Chinas " or " one China and one Taiwan " policy , resulting in the " creeping officiality " of Taiwan 's international status. 37 The PRC still has influence in blocking Taiwan 's aid offensive . For instance , Taiwan was excluded from a two-day conference in Tokyo in May 1992 that aimed at providing economic aid to Mongolia , at which seventeen countries and five international organizations participated. 38 After receiving $2 million in aid from Taiwan during the gulf crisis , Turkey turned down a further $3 million because of Beijing 's protest . Egypt also rejected a $5 million aid offer from Taiwan. 39 Partly because of the changing Middle East situation , and partly because of the reliance on the PRC for missile supplies and satellite launching , Saudi Arabia finally agreed to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly concerned with security , Taiwan 's money-oriented aid packages still have difficulty in competing with the PRC 's offer of arms . In order to head off further diplomatic setbacks such as those created by Saudi Arabia , Indonesia , and Singapore when they recognized the PRC in 1991 and South Korea in 1992 , Taiwan has pushed for more aid offensives in the developing countries . <p> Aid supporters , however , claim that aid is not strictly for political purpose . The need to maintain vigorous external economic relations for Taiwan 's sustained growth becomes another top priority . Aid paves the way for increasing Taiwan 's outward investment and acts as leverage to enable its investors to enjoy better treatment in recipient countries . " Aid constituency " in Taiwan apparently includes business groups who see foreign aid as one way to increase trade sales and investment opportunities . The commercial nature of Taiwan 's aid stimulates trade between donor and recipient and indirectly leads to more earnings because of viable trade cash flows . <p> Aid also creates relocation options so that Taiwan 's manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland China . Taiwan 's total investments in China reached well over $5 billion in 1991 , 41 but the Taiwanese government has long warned that the PRC intends to entrap Taiwanese enterprises and investment in China 's market and production in order to create irremediable dependency for future political blackmail . Dependence on the mainland has also pulled Taiwan into disputes that are not its own making . The United States has constantly threatened economic retaliation against the PRC for its unfair trade practices , lack of human rights protection , and violations of intellectual and property rights . Through its investments in mainland China , Taiwan is indirectly entangled in these disputes . A variety of aid packages in Southeast Asia gives Taiwanese business and industry the option of switching from the mainland to enjoy similar benefits of low labor costs and extensive investment advantages elsewhere . <p> Moreover , overseas investment eases pressures from the appreciation of Taiwan 's currency , labor shortages and wage increases , the growing demand for environmental protection , excessive foreign exchange reserves , and trade imbalances with other countries . Outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bypass quota restriction in the fenced markets of major trading partners such as the United States. 42 Aid serves the role of lubricant to smooth relations between host countries and investors and makes it easier for Taiwan 's companies to put down roots without stirring up any existing racial resentment against ethnic Chinese and outside Chinese investors in local economies , especially in Southeast Asia . Taiwan 's investment is therefore seen to be of little threat to the local government and societies . Thus , an " underlying rationally " concerning Taiwan 's trade and investment opportunities pushes forward the foreign aid programs . <p> In addition to the two top priorities of a solid international standing and trade and investment promotion , other objectives have been discussed , but they have received relatively lower priority and less attention . One is to address the need to help the less developed countries ( LDC ) , an idea that gained momentum in domestic political dialogues in the 1980s . The government claimed that Taiwan 's aid is considered not only an answer to the call for " burden sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic power shift to the Pacific . U.S. aid to Taiwan from 1949 to 1965 partially contributed to Taiwan 's political stability and economic prosperity . Now it can be said that it is time for Taiwan to pay back its due . Moreover , using the words of Taiwan 's foreign minister , Taiwan becomes " a potentially valuable contributor to the emerging new world order " by helping others. 43 Although countries still resist the idea of recognizing Taiwan , aid provides Taiwan with some room for diplomatic give-and-take in the international community . " Being there " in the international aid regime at least cultivates a positive image of Taiwan as a burden sharer , not a free rider . Therefore , the U.S. Brady Plan intending to reduce the LDC debt problem in 1989 initially received a positive , enthusiastic response from Taiwan . No doubt the government 's enthusiasm for the Brady Plan is more or less related to image maintenance for the sake of downplaying Taiwan 's trade surplus in recent years . No one can deny , however , that Taiwan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations of inequality between states . This concern serves as one legitimate reason for policy initiation and reinforces the justification for Taiwan 's continuing aid efforts. 44 <p> Another objective of aid is to enhance national pride . Taiwan 's rush toward advanced economic status has dazzled outsiders . The bestowing of foreign aid fosters a sense of pride because it indicates that Taiwan is capable of assisting others . The hidden implication behind such aid is that the government policies guided by the Nationalist party must have been correct all along in the past because they achieved such remarkable economic prosperity , which in turn has allowed Taiwan to offer help to others . The impact of foreign aid affects domestic politics in that it reinforces regime legitimacy and stability . The Effectiveness of Aid : Criticism at Home <p> Taiwan 's foreign aid program has not been implemented without controversy . At at time when people in Taiwan have been increasingly demanding extensive social and public services and an upgraded economic infrastructure for further economic development , they have been questioning the government 's priorities regarding domestic needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn the government back to the domestic needs and has somewhat restrained Taiwan 's external aid offensive to avoid internal criticism . For opponents of foreign aid , the first beneficiary of any " free lunch " should be the people of Taiwan . <p> Critics are particularly rankled by the Brady Plan . Several advanced industrialized states , the World Bank , and the International Monetary Fund are all involved in the multifaceted projects of the Brady Plan to relieve the third world debt . Although Taiwan received a tacit invitation to participate in this project , critics of foreign aid maintain that Taiwan has no obligation to join because it is no longer a member of these international organizations and has no diplomatic relations with participating industrialized countries . They add that the United States would use Taiwan 's contribution to promote its own philanthropic image and that Taiwan would remain anonymous . Pointing to the lukewarm response of the United States to Taiwan 's application for the GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) in 1989 , these critics argue that it seems pointless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge donation to a charity dinner without even receiving a ticket to attend the event . <p> Moreover , critics argue , most aid recipients are developing countries , hardly serious players in the world arena . Spending millions of dollars in aid in exchange for symbolic recognition does not seem to be a smart bargain . After all , Taiwan has been isolated for so long that to add a few more countries to the list of diplomatic recognition hardly improves the situation . <p> The pro-Taiwan independence groups , particularly those inside the opposition party ( the Democratic Progressive party ) , consider this " dollar diplomacy " a waste of Taiwan 's hard-earned foreign currency reserves and a tool to stall the natural course of Taiwan independence . In their view , the governing party , the KMT ( Nationalist party ) , tries to use foreign aid to sustain its claim of the " Republic of China . " They argue that the basic strategy for a diplomatic breakthrough is to claim Taiwan 's independent identity first . Only then can foreign aid be truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of using aid as a bargaining chip to purchase or to cling to a national title that has lost appeal to the international community. 46 <p> Opponents also raise the issue of the effectiveness of foreign aid . Although it is considered to be an excellent chance to participate in the international community , it has raised doubts about the worth of putting money into the deep , dark hole of third world countries . If advanced countries such as the United States and Japan have not been able to solve those thorny problems of debt and economic under development in the third world , how can one expect tiny Taiwan to achieve it ? There is evidence that foreign aid has done little to promote economic development in recipient countries . A typical case is Liberia , where two decades of foreign aid seem to have made little contribution to its economic development and agricultural production. 47 <p> Liberia is also an example of the two-China diplomatic tango : Liberia accepted help from Taiwan and mainland China , switching sides in 1977 and again in 1989 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic relations with Taiwan twice in 1962 and 1968 but switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1964 and 1976. 48 The establishment of diplomatic ties is built upon monetary assistance , but there is no guarantee that countries will not switch sides easily once the well of the aid package dries up . There is ample reason to question the use of foreign aid as a way to win international popularity . <p> In order to placate opponents ' criticism , much of Taiwan 's aid has been given on a request and application basis , which allows careful screening of the appropriateness of aid projects . This screening probably explains why so far the government in Taiwan has been slow to approve grants from the recently established IECDF . Until the end of 1991 , the government had budgeted $400 million for the fund , but only $114 million ( 28.5 percent ) had been delivered to twelve countries . Only seventeen out of eighty-three formal applications for IECDF assistance had been approved by 1991 , although twenty were still under evaluation. 49 Most applications have been from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial parks or export processing zones in which Taiwan 's industrial investors can benefit. 50 The Effectiveness of Aid : Donor Interest vs . Recipient Need <p> In order to assess the utility and limitation of Taiwan 's aid , it is necessary to examine whether Taiwan 's foreign aid policy follows the recipient need approach or the donor interest approach. 51 The former allocates aid in proportion to the recipient 's needs , whereas the latter employs aid programs to promote the interests of the donor . The bargaining position of the donor is strengthened during the aid relationship because the donor is able to terminate aid at its option . <p> Because access to government information is limited , no systematic relationship between aid and development can be established to substantiate the recipient need approach . Nevertheless , a variety of Taiwan 's aid programs do allow recipients to improve agricultural production , meet immediate socio-economic needs , and supplement the capital accumulation process. 52 On the other hand , it is undeniable that there is a hidden agenda behind Taiwan 's decisions . As the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing to help countries in need , and what 's wrong with getting some political benefit ? " 53 In fact , it seems naive to assume that most foreign aid efforts stem from purely humanitarian motives . Political expediency rides along with the aid programs . <p> Moreover , aid creates a reciprocal situation of commitment and reliance between Taiwan and aid recipients . Taiwan relies on the recipients , at least to facilitate investment , trade , and travel for the Taiwanese people , and at most to support its bid for membership in international organizations such as GATT and to help it gain diplomatic recognition . Aid from Taiwan is used as a carrot to reward countries pursuing policies favorable to Taiwan . <p> Aid efforts , nevertheless , are no guarantee of recognition or diplomatic ties . Taiwan 's bargaining advantage is unlikely to increase tremendously after the aid program begins , in part because the recipients see the PRC , a competing donor with Taiwan , waiting outside the door to strike a deal . A recent case is Niger : in 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Taipei 's promise of loans but faced diplomatic pressures as well as a significant aid counter-offer from Beijing. 54 This means that Taiwan may not be able to exact whatever it wishes from the recipient . The existence of the PRC lessens the likelihood of a recipient 's dependency on Taiwan as a donor. 55 Therefore , the argument that the donor 's bargaining position will be reinforced during the aid relationship is limited in Taiwan 's case . <p> This should not lead one to conclude that Taiwan suffers severely from the " reversed dependence " incurred by the aid relationship . Although Taiwan seems desperate to welcome any kind of official linkage , it is unreasonable to believe that Taiwan would fulfill every recipient 's demand . The proliferation of states and the demise of ideological confrontation in the post-cold war era have given Taiwan more access to various channels to improve its international status . One country 's decision to switch sides will not cause great damage . Taiwan has become used to external denials of its status in the international community . The threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield to a recipient 's wishes . Because money talks louder than politics to cash-hunting developing countries , aid donors still have some leverage . Though " reversed dependence " indeed exists , it is hard to imagine that Taiwan would reduce its autonomous position to a significant extent to fulfill any recipient 's demand . <p> Many recipients in fact view Taiwan 's foreign aid as less threatening than aid from other industrialized countries , which usually generates charges of a sellout to imperialism or foreign intervention . Unlike other countries , Taiwan has never explicitly mentioned human rights improvement in the recipient 's society as a contingency for aid . Other than its requests for diplomatic support , trade convenience , and investment benefits , Taiwan offers aid that allows a large degree of freedom for deliberation . In particular , Taiwan 's status as a newly industrialized economy , a country only recently advanced from a developing condition , more or less relieves a recipient 's concern with foreign exploitation . That is , Taiwan 's aid is perceived less as a malignant intention to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies , as world system approach or dependency approach scholars would proclaim , than as a coherent burst of pragmatism in Taiwan 's diplomatic approach . Aid therefore occurs when both donors and recipients see the convergence of national interests and willingness to accommodate each other . The modification of Taiwan 's stand on coexistence with the PRC in international affairs and the material incentives Taiwan offers give recipient countries a reasonable possibility of accepting the deal . The objectives of recipients and donors can be quite diverse yet complementary . <p> The twin crises of foreign debt combined with the lack of real substantial economic growth in the third world have apparently made Taiwan 's offers very tempting . So far , several countries have taken advantage of Taiwan 's economic aid and established official ties with Taiwan . Even though these nations are just " little friends , " the numbers game remains significant to Taiwan . In comparison with the more than 140 countries that have official ties with the PRC , thirty countries in total recognized Taiwan in 1992 , an increase from twenty-two countries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension of relations with these countries , a step short of severing relations completely. 56 Conclusions <p> In comparison with other industrialized countries , the total dollar amount of Taiwan 's aid looks small , yet it provides Taiwan with an image of " non-free-rider , " a nation willing to participate in international affairs and ready to offer help whenever needed . Through this image-building process , Taiwan may be able to participate in international organizations such as ( GATT , IMF , World Bank , or even the United Nations . Taiwan is learning from the experience of Japan and Germany : both emerged from isolation at the end of World War II into full participation in international politics . <p> Taiwan 's diplomacy , long steeped in straight anti-communist policy , has grown more flexible . Today it has been seen less in terms of a Manichaear struggle between the forces of right and the forces of wrong . Foreign aid is good example of this new tendency . Taiwan 's diplomacy is not strongly affected by a recipient country 's ideological leanings . <p> Taiwan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accepted this aid and improved their relations with Taiwan . Even if countries are reluctant to endorse Taiwan 's official identity separate from the PRC , the sheer existence of aid programs still serves the function of diplomatic linkage . And even if a recipient country establishes official ties with Beijing , Taiwan 's aid has continued if desired by the recipient , as is shown in the example of Senegal. 57 <p> Taiwan 's foreign aid helps convince industrialized countries , moreover , of its contribution to the international community and willingness to cooperate with the others in international affairs . Undoubtedly , decisions of developed countries to accept Taiwan back into the community in full scale also depend on the PRC 's tolerance of Taiwan 's effort to project itself as an independent political entity and whether the rest of the world is responding to the PRC 's pressure . <p> With the emergence of " donation fatigue " in most industrialized countries and the subsidence of ideological competition in the post-cold war era , Taiwan 's entrance into the club of donors is welcomed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy comes not so much from recipients but from criticisms of powerful opposition groups and suspicious constituencies within Taiwan . In order to diffuse criticism for its " black box " ( secret ) operations and the ambiguous delimitation of authority between governmental departments in the decision-making process , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan has started to draft a law to restructure all aid deliberation as well as implementation under an umbrella body . It would also make aid subject to parliamentary approval. 58 This would avoid the mixture of policy voices and make aid more accountable to the legislative discretion . Nevertheless , the question of whether Taiwan 's international status will be greatly improved due to this restructuring of its aid policy still remains to be answered in the coming decade .

@@4004941 Abstract <p> The general purpose of this study was to determine if marching band members , while carrying instruments , obtained 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on a daily basis . Heart rates were collected on 16 members of a university marching band . Results indicate a significant difference in highest heart rate means for those carrying light and heavy instruments . Subjects carrying heavy instruments obtained moderate intensity physical activity for 9.5 minutes daily while subjects carrying light instruments obtained moderate intensity physical activity for 8.3 minutes daily . Subjects did not meet the Surgeon General 's recommendation of 30 minutes daily of moderate activity from participation in marching band . Introduction <p> Historically , individuals striving to develop fitness were encouraged to follow the exercise prescription guidelines set forth by the American College of Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) which recommended that individuals train 3-5 days per week for at least 20-60 continuous minutes , performing activities that require large muscle groups at 60-90 percent of maximum heart rate intensity ( American College of Sports Medicine , 1995 ) . More recently , we know that health/fitness benefits can be obtained with much lower heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Centers for Disease Prevention and the ACSM now suggest that every adult obtain about 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most , if not all , days of the week ( Pate et al. , 1995 ; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , 1996 ) . Moderate activity has been defined as activity in which the heart rate is greater than 40 percent of maximum but less than 60 percent maximum ( Strand , Scantling &; Johnson , 1997 ) . Activities within this level of intensity may include badminton , golf , walking , softball , weight training , gardening , biking and recreational tennis . <p> In an attempt to catagorize the various intensities of physical activity , Terbizan and Strand ( 1998 ) described the Adult Activity Pyramid . The pyramid is divided into five zones as shown below and each zone is based on percentages related to a persons maximum heart rate ( MHR ) . <p> -- Weight Management Zone . Physical activity with a heart rate range of 40%-50% of ( MHR ) . <p> -- Heart Healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50%-70% of MHR . <p> -- Aerobic Zone . Physical activity with a heart rate range of 70%-85% of MHR . <p> -- Intense Conditioning Zone . Physical activity with a heart rate range of 80%-95% of MHR . <p> -- Red Zone . Physical activity with a heart rate range of 90%- 100% of MHR . <p> The purposes of this study were ( 1 ) to determine the difference in heart rates among marching band members who play instruments of different weights , ( 2 ) to determine the amount of time band members spent in each zone of the Adult Activity Pyramid , and ( 3 ) to determine if marching band members , during practice , obtained 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on a daily basis . Methodology <p> Subjects <p> Sixteen members , 14 male and 2 female , ranging in age from 18 to 23 years , of a university marching band , participated on a volunteer basis . All subjects signed an informed consent and were able to withdraw from the study at any time . The University Institutional Review Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching took place in the late afternoon , outdoors on an asphalt parking lot . <p> Instrumentation <p> Marching Cadence . The marching band utilized a Corps style of march , which is an eight-to-five step with eight steps to cover five yards ( covering 22.5 inches in each step ) . <p> Heart Rate Monitor . Polar Vantage XL heart rate monitors ( HRM ) were used to collect heart rate data . Data were collected in five second intervals and downloaded into a computer to be analyzed . <p> Adult Activity Pyramid . The target zones were calculated for all subjects based on their resting heart rates and ages . The Karvonen formula was used to determine individual heart rate target zones . The target zones were derived by taking a percentage of the difference between an individual 's maximum heart and resting heart rate and adding this to his or her resting heart rate . This calculation was done for each of the five Activity Pyramid zones . The target zones were set on the Polar analysis software , and the amount of time was calculated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 subjects were divided into two groups . The heavy group , with seven subjects , consisted of individuals carrying instruments of five pounds and greater while the light group , with nine subjects , was made up of individuals carrying instruments weighing less than five pounds . Instruments ranged in weight from 3 to 25 lbs . Each of the subjects was given a numbered HRM that was used throughout the study . Prior to data collection , the researcher met with all subjects collectively to explain the operation of the heart rate monitors . At this meeting the researcher collected personal information , including the age and resting heart rate of each subject . These data were used to determine the target zones of each individual . <p> Data were collected throughout an entire week , with groups of four to five people at a time . Seventeen heart rate recordings were collected from subjects . One recording was discarded because of a malfunction in the equipment . On the days when heart rate data were collected , the researcher assisted the subjects in putting on the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the limits were set for the heart rates . Heart rates were recorded at five-second intervals . Once subjects were ready to begin , they all started recording data by pressing the ' start " button . A check was taken of all watches and monitors to make sure all were working and recording data . When practice began , the researcher announced to the subjects to press the " store " button . This announcement marked the time that practice started . The wrist receiver was covered with a wristband , and auditory beeping was turned off . Rather than have the subjects note all actions , the researcher took notes on what they were doing throughout the session . When practice was over , the subjects pressed the " stop " button and monitors and watches were collected and downloaded . If there were any problems related to data collection , the same procedure took place two days later , and new data were collected . <p> All of the practices were generally the same in routine , with slight differences in break times . The practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a group warm-up ( five minutes ) where subjects stood and played their instruments with the rest of their section . The remainder of the practice time was spent marching and playing their instruments , with an occasional break ( 30 seconds to 1 minute ) to fix formations and alignment . During the marching drill for the week of this study , the band performed a swing theme . For a brief time ( 30 seconds to 1 minute ) , the entire band danced in a swing-like manner . One other unique aspect to the drill of the week was that they had a scatter drill . This drill consisted of the band members " scattering " or running to another spot on the field . This happened one time per practice sessions and marchers had 16 counts to get to their new spot . <p> Statistical analyses were performed using GB-Stat and Polar analysis software ( Polar Electro , 1993 ) . Mean heart rates for subjects carrying heavy and light instruments were calculated and compared in an analysis of variance to determine if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of .05 was used to determine if the difference in heart rates was significant between the heavy and light groups . The resting heart rates of each subject were used to determine the target zone on the Activity Pyramid . Results <p> Research question 1 sought to determine the difference in heart rates among marching band members who play instruments of different weights . Means and standard deviations of highest and average heart rates for the group carrying heavy instruments and the group carrying light instruments are reported in Table 1 . As noted , the mean highest heart rate and mean average heart rate were higher for subjects with heavy instruments . <p> The Analysis of Variance by groups ( heavy and light instruments ) was conducted using mean highest heart rate and mean average heart rate as dependant variables .

Subjects carrying light instruments had a daily mean of 4.4 minutes in the Weight Management Zone , 3.9 minutes in the Heart Healthy Zone , and 0.2 minutes in the Aerobic Zone . <p> Research question 3 sought to determine if band members , during marching band practice , obtained 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on a daily basis .

Although marching band members often spend several hours a week practicing and practices normally consist of marching and carrying an instrument for over an hour at one time , the health benefits of marching band have not been explored . <p> In this study , subjects did not reach the recommendation of 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity daily as suggested by the U.S. Surgeon General ( U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , 1996 ) . On average , the subjects spent 6.0 minutes in the Weight Management Zone , 2.85 minutes in the Heart Healthy Zone and 0.15 minutes in the Aerobic Zone , for a total of approximately 8.85 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity . In essence , subjects spent approximately 66 minutes in a 75 minute practice session with heart rates below a moderate intensity level of 40% of maximum heart rate . <p> It is well accepted that physical education addresses three domains , affective , cognitive and psychomotor , and some would list a fourth , fitness . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interscholastic sports are used to replace physical education credits , the true value of physical education can not be realized . Although some of the mentioned activities may provide learning experiences in one or more of the domains , those experiences may not be germane to physical education . For example , in marching band students certainly develop psychomotor skills such as being able to march and play an instrument at the same time but that is not remotely related to the types of psychomotor skills developed in physical education . <p> We would also argue that marching band does not and can not impact the affective and cognitive domains similar to that which is happening in physical education . This is not to say that marching band does not impact those two domains , it does . It simply does not affect those two domains like physical education does . In essence , each activity provides unique benefits and one can not be used to replace the other . <p> And finally , fitness benefits . Since marching band does involve movement it can be classified as physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained through physical education activities with those obtained through marching band , that could also be questioned . Strand and Reeder ( 1993a ) found that middle school students were above their 60% MHR for approximately 13 minutes in 35 minute class periods . In a second study the same researchers found that students were above their 60% MHR for 17.6 minutes ( Strand &; Reeder , 1993b ) . This compares to less than one-half of a minute for band members in this study . Similarly , Hannon and Pellett ( 1998 ) found that high school students were above their 40% MHR for approximately 21 minutes in 30 minute class periods . This compares to about nine minutes for band members who were engaged in 45 more minutes of activity . <p> In summary , marching band practice , during a slightly longer than a one hour long session , does not appear to provide a person enough physical activity to be in compliance with the Surgeon General 's suggestion . In light of these findings , one can truly question the value of replacing physical education credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart rate in beats per minute by group PREFORMATTED TABLE Table 2 .

@@4018441 ABSTRACT <p> While the readjustment of combat veterans of the Vietnam War has been studied extensively since the end of that conflict , no studies have focused on the readjustment problems of noncombatants serving in a peacekeeping capacity . Results are presented from a study of the psychosocial adjustment of 121 current and former Canadian Forces military personnel who served in Vietnam as members of an international peacekeeping force during the period of U.S. involvement in the war . These results indicate that the majority of Canadian Forces personnel have not suffered significant long-term adverse effects resulting from service in Vietnam . For a minority of respondents , however , service in Vietnam proved to be very stressful , resulting in symptoms of a stress reaction called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . The importance of war zone and postwar experiences in the development and continuation of PTSD are discussed . Policy implications for future Canadian Forces peacekeeping efforts are presented . <p> Canada has had a long history of involvement in peacekeeping activities in Vietnam . This involvement began with the establishment of the International Commission for Supervision and Control at the 1954 Geneva Conference . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Poland , and India , whose mission was to report and , hopefully , deter violations of the cease-fire agreement between the French and their Vietnamese supporters located south of the 17th parallel , on the one side , and the Communist and nationalist Vietnamese located north of the 17th parallel , on the other . By the end of 1954 there were approximately 200 Canadians in both North and South Vietnam as well as in Laos . A reduced Canadian presence continued for almost 19 years when the last ICSC representative departed Hanoi in March 1973 . Two members of the Canadian delegation ( CANDEL ) were killed during this period . <p> Canadian peacekeeping efforts continued after this date , however , as part of the International Commission for Control and Supervision , which was formed following a cease-fire agreement signed in Paris on 28 January 1973 by representatives of the United States , the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) , the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) , and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam ( Viet Cong ) . Members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indonesia . Between the period 27 January to 31 July 1973 approximately 250 Canadian military personnel served in Vietnam. ( n1 ) The total number of Canadians who served in the ICCS is estimated at 282 military and 37 civilian personnel. ( n2 ) One Canadian Forces ( CF ) member of the ICCS , Capt . C. E. Laviolette , was killed on 7 April 1973 . <p> The issue of Canadian involvement in the Vietnam war only recently has become the focus of research on the readjustment of Vietnam veterans . This article is based on a study of the psychosocial adjustment of 164 Canadians who served in Vietnam as part of the U.S. military. ( n3 ) Compared to U.S. Vietnam veterans , Canadian Vietnam veterans were found to have a greater prevalence of a stress reaction called Posttraumatic Stress Disorder . PTSD results from exposure to trauma that is generally outside the range of normal human experience . It is characterized by symptoms such as recurrent and intrusive dreams and recollections of a traumatic event , a numbing of responsiveness to the external world ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and additional symptoms ( e.g. sleep disturbance , survivor guilt , and memory or concentration impairment ) . ( n4 ) <p> PTSD has been documented in survivors of such traumas as flood , fire , or rape. ( n5 ) More commonly , the condition has been studied within a military context , particularly that of survivors of the Vietnam War. ( n6 ) Research has not focused , however , on the prevalence of disorders such as PTSD among peacekeeping forces . <p> While the chances of peacekeeping forces being wounded or killed are less than those for actual combatants , there are still risks involved . During the first three months of the 1973 cease-fire agreement in Vietnam , approximately 7,000 violations occurred , some involving extremely large-scale operations. ( n7 ) In the course of investigating cease-fire violations it would not be uncommon to witness the aftermath of such violations ( e.g. wounded or dead soldiers and/or civilians ) . Past studies of Vietnam veterans have shown that it was not necessary to be a combatant to be traumatized by war. ( n8 ) Nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet they experienced the same prevalence of PTSD as did actual combat troops . This finding lends support to the hypothesis that exposure to the violent aftermath of combat and the constant threat of danger can be just as traumatic as direct combat participation. ( n9 ) The prevalence of stress reactions such as PTSD among CF personnel in Vietnam is unknown . Any problems experienced by Canadian military personnel as a result of their peacekeeping duties in Vietnam are likely to have been unrecognized or misdiagnosed since PTSD was not an official psychiatric diagnosis until 1980 . <p> In an effort to determine the effects of peacekeeping service in Vietnam on members of the CF , a research project was initiated in late 1987 . The primary focus of the study is on the psychosocial adjustment and prevalence of PTSD among these CF personnel as compared to the results of earlier studies using the same methodology with U.S. Vietnam veterans and Canadians who joined the U.S. military and served in Vietnam . Method <p> Respondents consisted of members of the CF who served in Vietnam with either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war ( 1961-1975 ) . Potential respondents were located by several techniques . First , advertisements were placed in the monthly magazine published by the Royal Canadian Legion and in the publication Sentinel , which is put out by the CF. Second , personnel data files maintained at National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa were searched to identify names and addresses of all CF personnel still on active duty who were formerly posted in Vietnam . Third , the CANDEL ICCS Association was contacted . This group is composed of military and civilian personnel who served in Vietnam with either the ICSC or the ICCS . <p> A cover letter , questionnaire , informed-consent form , and postage-paid return envelope were mailed to all respondents ( N = 39 ) identified through the first two techniques . Due to concern over maintaining the confidentiality of the membership roster of the CANDEL ICCS Association , the questionnaire packets were sent in blank , postage-paid envelopes to the president of the association , who then supplied the names and addresses of individual members on the envelopes and mailed them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked against the CANDEL ICCS Association roster to avoid duplicate mailings of the questionnaire . A total of 213 questionnaires were mailed to association members . Canadians who served in Vietnam as civilians with the Department of External Affairs were excluded from the study , as were military members who served in Vietnam prior to 1961 . <p> All respondents were sent a modified copy of a research instrument entitled the Vietnam-Era Veterans Adjustment Survey , which has established validity and reliability in studies involving over 2,700 respondents. ( n10 ) The VEVAS provides information on demographics , attitudes and opinions about the war , combat experiences , social support experiences during and after service in Vietnam ( particularly during the first year back ) , and both physical and psychosocial health problems during and after service in Vietnam . Results <p> Questionnaires were sent to a total of 252 current and former CF personnel who served in Vietnam with the ICSC or the ICCS . Twelve questionnaires were returned as undeliverable , and one was returned because the individual was deceased . Completed questionnaires were received from 121 respondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . <p> In terms of demographic data ( see Table 1 ) , the respondents range in age from 40 to 74 years , with the average being just under 53 years . These respondents are nearly 11 years older than Canadians who served in Vietnam with the U.S. military , ( n11 ) the major reason being that the peacekeeping forces were largely composed of older , experienced career officers and enlisted personnel . Of the 89 officers ( 74% of the sample ) , 47 ( 53% ) held the rank of major or higher while in Vietnam . Of the 31 enlisted personnel ( 26% of the sample ) , 24 ( 77% ) held the rank of sergeant or higher . Data on rank was unavailable for one respondent . The respondents spent an average of 26 years on active duty and just over 6 months in Vietnam , with the overwhelming majority ( 86% ) serving in 1973 . Over 56 percent of the respondents reported that they volunteered for duty in Vietnam . Two respondents reported being hospitalized while in Vietnam for combat-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-combat-related reasons . <p> Racially , over 96 percent of the respondents are white with only one Oriental , one Hispanic , one black , and one North American Indian or Innuit . The respondents are also highly educated , with 90 percent having graduated from high school and 40 percent being university graduates . Over 90 percent of the respondents are currently married , and just over 9 percent are either separated , widowed , or single . A total of 14 respondents have been divorced , and 4 of these 14 ( 29% ) report that their service in Vietnam contributed to their divorce . <p> Turning to combat experiences in Vietnam , only 2 respondents reported firing their weapon at other soldiers . No respondents reported wounding or killing anyone or being directly involved in killing or wounding civilians , although 2 respondents felt they were indirectly involved in killing or wounding civilians . Fifteen respondents ( 12.7% ) were involved in firefights in Vietnam , while 22 percent at one time or another found themselves in a combat situation in which they thought they might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being killed or wounded in Vietnam . In terms of exposure to the violent aftermath of combat , 30 percent of the respondents reported seeing others being killed , 72 percent reported seeing bodies of dead soldiers , 60 percent reported seeing bodies of dead civilians , 83 percent reported seeing wounded soldiers , and 73 percent reported seeing wounded civilians . <p> Respondents were asked a series of questions related to psychosocial health problems they might have experienced while serving in Vietnam . Over 40 percent of respondents reported drinking alcohol often or very often while in Vietnam , but only 3 respondents reported using drugs while in Vietnam . Over 10 percent had trouble dealing with bad memories about their experiences , with 16 percent reporting trouble falling asleep and 5 percent reporting recurring bad dreams or nightmares while in Vietnam . Ten percent of the respondents had trouble getting emotionally close to others , and over 31 percent had trouble trusting others in Vietnam . Forty percent of the respondents had trouble tolerating frustration while in Vietnam and 12 percent had trouble controlling their temper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent felt nervous frequently , and 29 percent felt overly aroused or " keyed up " in Vietnam . Only 6 percent of respondents reported having " flashbacks " in Vietnam in which they felt like they were reexperiencing events . Eleven percent had trouble dealing with stressful experiences , and over 33 percent felt that their actions in Vietnam were not worthwhile . <p> Social-support experiences while in Vietnam were generally quite good . Over 92 percent of respondents often socialized with and felt close to members of their unit in Vietnam . Approximately 89 percent felt that members of their unit understood them and their problems and were supportive . Only 35 percent of respondents reported often writing to friends or relatives back home about their problems in Vietnam . Of those who did write , 46 percent reported receiving expressions of support from friends and 50 percent from relatives . When asked who helped them the most in dealing with their problems while in Vietnam , 23 percent of the respondents reported that members of their unit had been the most helpful . Almost 64 percent reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year back from Vietnam only 45 percent of the respondents reported positive attitudes from fellow Canadians toward the war itself , but over 80 percent reported positive attitudes from others toward their involvement in Vietnam . Attitudes toward their involvement in the war were slightly more positive ( 83% ) from Canadian veterans of previous war eras . Over 73 percent of the respondents often initiated conversations about their experiences in the war during their first year back , and over two-thirds reported often getting together with other veterans of Vietnam to talk about their experiences . Only 7 percent of the respondents reported experiencing negative or hostile events after returning from Vietnam ( e.g. , being spit at or challenged to fight in bars ) that were related to their involvement there , and less than 5 percent of the respondents reported that the way they were treated by friends , relatives , or the public in general kept them from talking about their experiences in Vietnam as much as they may have wanted . Thus , most of these veterans did not encounter many negative or hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of U.S. Vietnam veterans . <p> Physical health data in the VEVAS consist of responses to a 75-item symptom checklist based on the Cornell Medical Index. ( n12 ) The respondent indicates whether he has ever been bothered by a particular ailment or illness since entering the Canadian Forces and , if so , whether he is still bothered . These 75 items comprise six different categories or clusters of health symptoms : respiratory , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , nervous system , skin disorders , and general health . Items within each category are summed to provide total scores . The results reveal that the vast majority of these veterans do not appear to have any significant health problems . Only 6 of the 75 items were checked as being currently experienced by 10 percent or more of the respondents . These items include hay fever ( 11% ) , high blood pressure ( 11% ) , frequent upset stomach ( 12% ) , frequent indigestion ( 10% ) , hemorrhoids ( 18% ) , and being overweight ( 15% ) . <p> If one looks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CF , the number of items checked as being experienced by more than 10 percent of the respondents is 16 . These items include : frequent clearing of the throat ( 11% ) , a continually stuffed-up nose ( 12% ) , persistent severe colds ( 11% ) and heavy chest colds ( 11% ) , hay fever ( 16% ) , high blood pressure ( 22% ) , pains in the heart or chest ( 18% ) , frequent upset stomach ( 15% ) , indigestion ( 13% ) , and loose bowel movements ( 12% ) , hemorrhoids ( 33% ) , skin rashes ( 12% ) , tiredness after working ( 14% ) , exhaustion upon getting up in the morning ( 11% ) , and being overweight ( 25% ) . <p> To determine the relationship between physical health and psychosocial health , Pearson correlations were computed between scores representing the 11 symptoms of PTSD and all 6 categories of current physical health . Results indicate highly significant positive correlations between PTSD symptoms and respiratory problems ( r = 0.28 , p < 0.05 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.01 ) , gastrointestinal problems ( r - 0.40 , p < 0.001 ) , and nervous system problems ( r = 0.54 , p < 0.01 ) . <p> The same questions concerning psychosocial health problems that the respondents answered for the period of their service in Vietnam were also answered for the present . Currently only 13 percent of the respondents report drinking alcohol often or very often , with an additional 54 percent drinking occasionally . No current drug use was reported . While 10 percent of the respondents currently have trouble falling asleep , only 4 percent have trouble dealing with bad memories about experiences in Vietnam , and less than 3 percent report recurring bad dreams or nightmares about events in Vietnam . Sixteen percent have trouble getting emotionally close to others , and almost 18 percent have trouble expressing their feelings to those they care about . Twenty-three percent report trouble tolerating frustration , and 13 percent have trouble controlling their temper . Eleven percent feel depressed a lot while 9 percent feel nervous a lot , and 16 percent report feeling overly aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having flashbacks to events in Vietnam . Fourteen percent of the respondents report trouble trusting other people , with an equal number reporting trouble dealing with stressful experiences . Over 21 percent of the respondents currently feel that their actions in Vietnam were not worthwhile . <p> In addition to noting the kinds of problems reported by respondents both during their service in Vietnam and at the present time , particular patterns of problems representing the symptoms of PTSD were identified to determine the prevalence of this disorder . Results indicate that three respondents ( 2.5% ) are currently experiencing symptoms of PTSD . Six respondents ( 5.0% ) reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD during their service in Vietnam . This figure includes two of the respondents who also report current symptoms of PTSD , which means that the total number of respondents who have experienced PTSD is seven , rather than nine . <p> By comparing respondents reporting current PTSD symptoms with those reporting symptoms during their service in Vietnam , one can calculate additional prevalence rates representing the categories of acute , chronic , and delayed PTSD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their service in Vietnam but do not report being bothered by symptoms at the present time . These respondents may be considered to have experienced acute PTSD , although it is possible these symptoms may have lasted more than six months , contrary to guidelines specified in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. ( n13 ) One respondent ( 0.8% ) reported no symptoms of PTSD during service in Vietnam but does report symptoms of PTSD at the present time . This respondent may be thought of as having delayed PTSD . Two other respondents ( 1.7% ) reported being bothered by symptoms of PTSD while in Vietnam and report still being bothered by symptoms of PTSD at the present time . These respondents are considered to have chronic PTSD . These mutually exclusive categories may be combined to yield an overall PTSD rate consisting of the percentage of respondents who have experienced symptoms of PTSD at any time during or after service in Vietnam . Seven respondents fit this category for an overall rate of 5.8 percent . <p> In order to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTSD symptomatology of the respondents , a multiple regression analysis was performed . Variables representing combat experiences ( COMBAT ) , social support received during service in Vietnam ( VSS ) , social support received during the first year back from Vietnam ( FYSS ) , and during the year of respondent service in Vietnam ( WARYEAR ) were regressed against a variable representing the 11 symptoms of current PTSD ( CPTSD ) measured in the VEVAS. ( n14 ) Military rank was not entered into the equation on the basis of t-test results that found no significant differences between officers or enlisted personnel on any psychosocial health problem either during or after service in Vietnam . Interaction terms for these variables were computed by standardizing responses via Z-score transformations and entered into the regression equation . This procedure allows the regression analysis to test interactions among the variables similar to analysis of variance , but does not require that the independent variables be grouped into discrete levels . <p> The results of this regression analysis on the variable CPTSD ( R-Square = 0.33 ) revealed a highly significant main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ < 0.01 ) and main effects that approached , but did not exceed , levels of conventional statistical significance for first-year social support ( F1,117 = 2.61 , p = 0.10 ) and for support during the year the respondent served in Vietnam ( F1,117 = 3.53 , p = 0.06 ) . In addition , a highly significant interaction was found between combat experience and first-year social support ( F1,117 ) = 10.93 , p < 0.01 ) . These results indicate that increased combat experience is associated with increased severity of PTSD symptomatology , and respondents whose social-support experiences during the first year back from Vietnam were primarily positive in nature have significantly lower levels of PTSD than do respondents whose experiences were critical or nonsupportive . <p> As a means of determining the nature of the significant FYSS x COMBAT interaction , respondents were divided into four groups on the basis of their scores on the variables FYSS and COMBAT ( High FYSS/High COMBAT , High FYSS/Low COMBAT , Low FYSS/High COMBAT , Low FYSS/Low COMBAT ) . Results of t-test comparisons of the means for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat experience with high first-year social support ( M = 3.54 ) was associated with the least amount of PTSD symptomatology while the combination of high combat experience and low first-year social support ( M = 8.75 ) yielded the greatest amount of PTSD symptomatology ( t88 = 2.07 , p < 0.05 ) . <p> In order to determine which factors may have influenced the development of PTSD symptoms during service in Vietnam , the variables COMBAT , VSS , WARYEAR and all computed interaction terms were regressed against the variable VPTSD , which represents the 11 items in the VEVAS measuring symptoms of PTSD during service in Vietnam . The variable FYSS was not included in this analysis since it represents events that took place after service in Vietnam . The results of this analysis ( R-Square = 0.27 ) revealed highly significant main effects for combat experience ( F1,119 = 24.18 , p < 0.01 ) and the year of service in Vietnam ( F1,119 = 6.64 , p < 0.01 ) . The effect for social support during Vietnam approached , but did not exceed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . No significant interactions were found . <p> Increased combat experience was found to be significantly related to increased levels of PTSD symptomatology during service in Vietnam . Those respondents who served in Vietnam prior to 1973 with the ICSC were found to have significantly more reported PTSD symptomatology during their service in Vietnam than respondents who served during and after 1973 with the ICCS . <p> Although the respondents do report experiencing various psychosocial health problems , the overwhelming majority continue to look upon their service in the CF and as peacekeepers in Vietnam as positive and beneficial . Over 83 percent report that if another war similar to Vietnam broke out they would be willing to serve in a similar capacity . Seventy-five percent of the respondents report that their military experiences have helped them get ahead in their job or career . Ninety-five percent of the respondents feel that their service in the military has helped them become a better person , and 76 percent report that their service in Vietnam has helped them in this regard . In the event of a future war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier because of their service in Vietnam . Finally , over 98 percent of the respondents feel that the overall impact of their military service on their life has been positive , and over 83 percent feel the same way about their service in Vietnam . Discussion <p> The results of this study , although unavoidably subject to the problems of retrospective reporting , demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of CF personnel who served in Vietnam on peacekeeping duty have not suffered any long-term adverse effects from their service . Although a fair number of the respondents ( 10-30% ) reported experiencing various kinds of psychosocial problems both during service in Vietnam and at the present time , these problems appear to be relatively minor in that respondents have continued to cope and are successful , healthy , contributing members of society . <p> While certainly not representative of other military personnel who served in Vietnam as combatants , there is no reason to believe that the respondents in this study are significantly different from those CF peacekeepers who did not respond to the questionnaire . Some respondents noted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they were peacekeepers , not combatants as were U.S. Vietnam veterans . Thus it is likely that many of the nonresponders felt the same way and chose not to participate on this basis . Given the nature of peacekeeping duties , it is likely that the findings of the present study can be generalized to other peacekeeping forces , particularly Canadian efforts in areas such as Cyprus and Namibia . <p> The data demonstrate that for these respondents military service , including service in Vietnam , has been of great importance to them in their career and personal development . Most of the respondents look upon their service in Vietnam as just another posting . They do not consider themselves " Vietnam veterans " in the sense that other Canadians who served with the U.S. military do . Many respondents are justifiably proud of their role as peacekeepers in Vietnam , although nearly one-quarter still feel that their actions in Vietnam were not worthwhile . <p> For a minority of respondents , however , service in Vietnam was very stressful and resulted in symptoms of PTSD . The reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and overall ( 5.8% ) PTSD compare very favorably with rates found among other U.S. and Canadian veterans who served in Vietnam ( see Table 2 ) . The six groups of Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans being compared consist of active duty U.S. Army soldiers , active duty U.S. Army Nurse Corps personnel , soldiers assigned to troop units in the U.S. Army Reserve , U.S. veterans ( civilians ) receiving medical compensation from the Veterans Administration , Canadians who joined the U.S. military and served in Vietnam , and CF military personnel who served in Vietnam as peacekeepers . The most comparable sample to the CF personnel in terms of noncombat duty would be the U.S. Army Nurse Corps members . Neither group actively participated in combat but both were exposed to the often violent aftermath of combat ( witnessing dead and wounded personnel ) and were still in danger , even though they were noncombatants . <p> One may argue that the reported rates of PTSD for CF personnel may not be due to Vietnam at all but rather to other types of traumatic experiences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the data in Table 2 can support both views . For example , the current rate of PTSD among CF personnel ( 2.5% ) is virtually identical to that of active-duty , U.S. Army Vietnam-era veterans ( 2.3% ) . ( A Vietnam-era veteran is defined as someone who was on active duty during the period of the Vietnam War but did not serve in Vietnam . ) If you compare the CF personnel to active-duty , Vietnam-era nurses , however , the rate for CF personnel is over three times higher ( 2.5% , vs. 0.8% ) . Compared to U.S. Army Reserve Vietnam-era veterans , the rate of current PTSD is two-thirds higher ( 2.5% vs. 1.5% ) . The PTSD rate ( 10% ) for U.S. Vietnam-era veterans who have not maintained any military affiliation ( civilians ) is much higher . These veterans are experiencing some type of medical/psychiatric problem for which they are currently receiving disability compensation from the Veterans Administration , which increases the likelihood of finding stress-related disorders such as PTSD . <p> Although this comparison only deals with current PTSD rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms in the past would have been medically discharged from the military and thus have become the responsibility of the Veterans Administration . The high rate of PTSD found among the sample of civilian Vietnam-era veterans obtained from the VA would tend to support this argument . Thus , rather than the current PTSD rate , a more accurate comparison might be the overall PTSD rate for CF personnel ( 5.8% ) , which is indeed much higher than among Vietnam-era veterans . <p> The results of the regression analyses confirm past findings on the importance of both war zone and postwar experiences ( e.g. social support ) on the development of stress reactions such as PTSD . The findings confirm the observation that one does not have to be a combatant to be traumatized by war . Exposure to danger and to the violent aftermath of combat ( seeing dead bodies and/or wounded personnel ) proved to be traumatic for several CF noncombatant personnel , just as it was for noncombatant U.S. Army nurses . Social-support experiences , particularly those encountered during the first year back from Vietnam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of PTSD and acted as a moderator-variable on the effects of combat experience in Vietnam . <p> Several policy implications for effective performance in future CF peacekeeping efforts may be inferred from this study . One is the need for awareness of the potential negative effects of peacekeeping duties on the psychosocial health of CF personnel . One must look beyond the obvious , traditional forms of stress reactions resulting from actual combat ( combat stress reaction , battle fatigue , etc. ) to the more-insidious and less-obvious stress reactions such as PTSD . Another implication of the study is the various ways in which stress can manifest itself . Although one can not argue cause and effect on the basis of correlational data , it is evident that exposure to stressful experiences may result in both physical and psychosocial health problems . <p> Personnel returning from peacekeeping duties should be thoroughly debriefed by mental health professionals and given the opportunity to work through any stressful experiences . In this regard , CF mental health personnel should be specifically trained to recognize and treat stress reactions such as PTSD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of mental health professionals to recognize symptoms of delayed stress and to develop appropriate treatment strategies . General medical officers should also undergo this same training since soldiers are often reluctant to talk about or will deny having mental health problems but will more readily admit to physical health problems which the trained physician will recognize as being possibly stress-related . <p> Societal support for the peacekeeping role should be carefully assessed before troops are committed , to ensure that returning personnel do not have to bear the brunt of negative societal reactions to their participation in such missions . Greater public awareness of the positive value of peacekeeping roles by CF personnel may also help peacekeepers cope with any problems they experience . <p> 
@@4016441 In this article , we examine the predictive power of selected social and academic variables regarding arrest frequency for 11th-grade boys who 7 years earlier had been judged to be at risk for developing antisocial behavior patterns . Multiple regression analyses indicated that ( a ) measures of academic and social skills that reflected more skilled and positive profiles were associated with participants ' exhibiting less frequent and less severe forms of antisocial behavior , as shown by arrest records at 11th grade , and ( b ) antisocial measures on which participants scored higher were associated with more frequent arrests for more serious offenses in Grade 11 . We also conducted an analysis of the residuals to study those persons and their characteristics who were misclassified by the predictive model . Implications of these results for future research and intervention , particularly within the context of schooling , are discussed . <p> In the field of emotional and behavioral disorders , one of the most important -- and difficult -- research issues concerns the accurate prediction of individuals ' future antisocial acts based on past and current knowledge of those persons and their behavioral characteristics ( Fartington &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is arrest status , which is routinely used as a proxy variable for antisocial risk status in spite of the vagaries and inconsistencies inherent within the legal system and its accommodation of at risk youth ( e.g. , Henggler , 1989 ; Hindelang , Hirschi , &; Weis , 1979 ; Patterson , 1982 ) . The general public and governing officials place considerable weight on the importance of arrest status as a social status indicator ( Farrington &; Tarling , 1985 ) . The ability to accurately predict if an individual will be arrested in the future is an important outcome of research efforts . If a stable set of predictor variables that account for antisocial behavior at some later point in time could be isolated , it theoretically would be possible to ( a ) identify at an early stage those individuals who are likely to engage in severe antisocial acts in the future and ( b ) prevent these acts by applying comprehensive supports and services that addressed the at-risk persons ' unique needs ( Kazdin , 1987 ) . <p> Such a research emphasis is critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective impact on the processes and outcomes of schooling . In recent years , the general public has expressed great concern over the escalating incidence of arrests among U.S. adolescents .

School violence has emerged as a major societal concern in recent years due to the egregious violent acts that have been committed on school grounds and the public 's emerging awareness of just how vulnerable school settings are to criminal activity by students and others ( Flannery , 1997 ; Gottfredson , 1997 ; Walker , Colvin , &; Ramsey , 1995 ) . <p> Currently , the public school systems are being required to expand the range and number of services to an ever-increasing spectrum of adolescents who manifest , or are at risk for , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kauffman , Lloyd , Baker , &; Riedel , 1995 ) . Numerous studies documented the importance of family and societal risk factors associated with the development of antisocial behavior patterns among adolescents ( Kazdin , 1987 ; Loeber , 1982 ; Loeber &; Stouthamer-Loeber , 1998 ; Patterson , Reid , &; Dishion , 1992 ; Robins , &; Rutter , 1990 ) . One notable characteristic of promising intervention programs for this population is location within the school setting where at-risk children and youth are accessible and intervention resources can be concentrated to address their needs ( Dryfoos , 1990 , 1993 ) . For many young people , school is one of the most stable experiences in their lives , with the potential to provide important academic and social services ( Walker &; Bullis , 1995 ) . Given the dismal record of the great majority of interventions for at-risk adolescents ( Kazdin , 1987 ; Reid , 1993 ) , it seems clear that programs for this population must address family , social , and school-related variables if they are to demonstrate positive effects . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing the problems of antisocial behavior , delinquency , and violence among at-risk youth ; however , because these social problems are now impinging intensely upon school settings , such detachment is no longer tenable . One of our long-term goals is to assist schools and educators in taking a leadership role in addressing these problems and using the context of schooling to divert at-risk children and youth from paths that too often inexorably lead to unfortunate outcomes . The school setting , for example , provides an ideal environment for hosting and coordinating comprehensive intervention approaches -- such as partnerships among the school staff , families , and community agencies -- that can be effective with this population . <p> The purpose of this article is to describe a longitudinal study focused on predicting the arrest status of a selected subsample of adolescents judged to be at risk for engaging in antisocial behavior from data gathered primarily within the school setting . In collaboration with Patterson and his associates at the Oregon Social Learning Center ( OSLC ; Patterson , 1983 ; Patterson &; Bank , 1986 , 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have been involved in a long-term longitudinal study of two samples of adolescent males who displayed differing levels of risk status ( severe versus mild ) for antisocial behavior patterns at the point of their selection into the study , which was elementary-school age ( Walker , Shinn , O'Neill , &; Ramsey , 1987 ) . Both groups were drawn from a larger study conducted by Patterson ( 1983 ) and his associates as part of a long-term ( from age 8 to adulthood ) investigation into the correlates and longitudinal stability of antisocial behavior patterns ( the Patterson Oregon Youth Study OYS ) . From this point forward , we refer to these participants as the Walker subsample . <p> In this article , we discuss the testing of the power of a model composed of selected variables in predicting the arrest status over a 7-year follow-up period of the Walker subsample participants . The predicted criterion was a scalar outcome variable of antisocial behavior -- ranging from the complete absence of antisocial behavior to differing levels of antisocial behavior -- as reflected by the frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also examined cases in which persons were misclassified ( i.e. , an individual was predicted to have an antisocial profile at 11th grade but did not have such a profile ) to increase our knowledge of the intricacies and dynamics of the prediction model . METHOD <p> In this section we describe the ( a ) sample recruitment and selection procedures used for the Patterson ( 1983 ) OYS at-risk sample ( N = 206 ) and for the Walker subsample ( n = 80 ) , ( b ) longitudinal design , ( c ) data collection procedures , and ( d ) subgroups of the Walker subsample that were compared on the outcome constructs and the analyses used for this purpose . Sample Recruitment and Selection Procedures for the OYS <p> A cohort-sequential design ( Baltes , 1968 ) was used to structure the longitudinal tracking and data collection procedures for the Patterson OYS . At the present time , the OYS longitudinal investigation is continuing with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health . Participants are now entering adulthood , and the community adjustment experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , Patterson et al. , 1992 ) . <p> Three school districts in the metropolitan area of Eugene-Springfield , Oregon , a medium-size suburban community with a population of approximately 250,000 , agreed to participate in the OYS . The purpose of the initial recruitment effort was to identify and include boys with elevated risk factors for antisocial behavior who therefore theoretically were at risk for developing antisocial behavior patterns . This sample thus was not representative of the community at large ; however , in terms of demographics such as race , ethnicity , and SES levels , the sample did appear to be representative . <p> Juvenile court data were used to establish the frequency of delinquent episodes reported by the police for the community , and the incidence of juvenile crime was calculated for the neighborhoods serving each of the 43 elementary schools within the three school districts . The 15 schools located in the areas with the highest incidence of crime were chosen as target schools for recruitment into the Patterson OYS study . In the first year of the study , 14 schools agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then randomly ordered , and the first 6 schools were recruited . ( Only 6 of the 15 schools were needed because the recruitment rate was higher than expected ) . In the second year of the study , this selection process was repeated and 7 targeted schools were recruited . <p> In each of the 2 years in which we recruited participants , all families with boys in fourth grade at the selected schools were invited to participate in the OYS study . Of these , 31 families were deemed ineligible because they spoke a language other than English or were planning to move out of state within the next 6 months . Of the remaining 277 families in the pool , 206 ( 74.4% ) agreed to participate in the study . The first cohort ( n - 102 ) was recruited in the 1983-1984 school year ; the second cohort ( n = 104 ) was recruited in the 19841985 school year . Statistical analysis revealed similarity between the cohorts on all demographic variables : the families were primarily lower income ( more than 20% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families received welfare ) and almost all were White , which reflects the community 's demographics . Walker Subsample Recruitment and Selection <p> Since 1984 , we have studied a subsample of 80 participants drawn from the larger OYS sample . The purpose was to focus on the educational performance of at-risk males in conjunction with the rich data set provided by the OYS sample . Because limited resources precluded inclusion of the entire OYS sample in this research effort , we chose a subsample representing two levels of risk for developing antisocial behavior patterns : mild and severe ( Walker , 1984 ) . Participants were selected from each of the two OYS cohorts and divided into either antisocial or at-risk control groups based upon their scores on ( a ) an antisocial construct developed by the Oregon Social Learning Center that was composed of a weighted combination of measures constructed from home observations , child and teacher interviews , and peer nominations , and ( b ) aggression subscale scores from the Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ; Achenbach &; Edelbrock , 1991 ) and the Teacher Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBCL assigned by parents and teachers . <p> Parent and teacher ratings were critical in determining the antisocial and at-risk control groups in the subsample and also were key components of the antisocial construct scores used in the participant selection process . The CBCL and TRF are well-researched instruments demonstrating ( a ) more than adequate test-retest reliabilities , ( b ) highly statistically significant correlations with observational ratings of child problem behavior , and ( c ) powerful discriminant validity , with the ability to discriminate between children with and without emotional disorders , diagnostic subgroups of children who have emotional or behavioral disturbances , and students in general education classes from those in special education classes ( Edelbrock , 1988 ) . <p> The antisocial group within the Walker subsample consisted of 39 individuals . Out of the total sample of 206 , members of this group ranked highest on the antisocial construct score , and their parent and teacher aggression subscale scores from the CBCL were 1 standard deviation or more above the mean of the national standardization sample for this instrument . A table of random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n = 41 ) from the remaining pool of approximately 160 subjects . Extensive descriptions of the backgrounds and characteristics of these study participants can be found in Walker et al . ( 1987 ) . No consistent differences were evident in the demographic data for ethnicity and parental income for the two subsamples ( Walker et al. , 1987 ) . The current sample size of 76 represents 95% of the original sample . The four participants no longer in the study either moved or declined further participation . Longitudinal Design and Data Collection Schedule <p> OYS study participants are assessed repeatedly over time on an array of variables measuring ( a ) personal adjustment and attitudes , ( b ) family dynamics , ( c ) parenting practices , and ( d ) outcomes such as drug use , arrests , school performance , and affiliation with antisocial peers . Measures are recorded annually . Complete assessments are done every other year , and partial assessments are done during the intervening years . Each year 's assessments and resulting data are referred to as a " data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Patterson et al. , 1992 ) . The data for this study were drawn from these procedures and measures . Constructs and Measures <p> Seminal work on the development and validation of global construct scores for assessing the status of antisocial populations has been carried out by Patterson and his associates ( see Capaldi &; Patterson , 1989 ; Patterson &; Bank , 1986 , 1989 ) . As part of their ongoing research , Patterson and his colleagues developed a series of highly sensitive construct scores to describe the OYS study participants and their caregivers . These construct scores ( a ) are multi-agent , multi-method , and/or multi-setting in nature ; ( b ) have excellent psychometric characteristics ; and ( c ) are highly predictive of important outcomes in child and youth development over a number of years ( Walker , Irvin , Noell , &; Singer , 1992 ) . Descriptions of the construct scores used in this study -- as well as in the OYS project -- and their development and validation are described and illustrated in Capaldi and Patterson ( 1989 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also evidence considerable validity in predicting long-term outcomes of social importance ( e.g. , arrest status , drug use , school dropout ) . Capaldi and Patterson standardized all constructs to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one . <p> Six construct scores measured at different data collection waves in the OYS longitudinal study , and a social skills rating by teachers , were considered in the initial pool of predictor variables for this study . The means , standard deviations , and sample sizes for these variables at different data collection waves -- and their correlations with the criterion variable -- are presented in Table 1 . Brief descriptions of the constructs used in the current study and of the social skills rating scale follow . <p> Child Antisocial Construct . This construct was based on numerous scales ( including Morn , Dad , Teacher , Parent , and Child Reports on the Child Overt and Covert Antisocial measures ) , a single score indicator from the Parent Report , and two single-item indicators : " How often child exerts negative influence on friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Items with an item-total correlation of less than .2 were excluded . Many of the items had low variance , which was expected , given the nature of the Antisocial construct . Items with variance less than .2 were not excluded for this reason . Variables were computed for the scale by taking the mean , given that 60% or more of the items in that scale were present . <p> Academic Skills . Four indicators were developed to assess the Academic Skills construct . These were CBCLs completed by the teacher and parent(s) , the Wide Range Achievement Test ( WRAT-3 ; Wilkinson , 1983 ) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test ( PPVT ; Dunn &; Dunn , 1981 ) administered at OSLC , and standardized scholastic tests administered once a year at the student 's school . These indicators focused mainly on the student 's skills in math , reading , spelling , and language arts . The Academic Skills construct has high internal validity , with all indicators loading on a single factor . <p> Examples of items from the CBCL-Parent included in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Is child in a special class ? and ( #7:4 ) Has child ever repeated a grade ? Items from the CBCL-Teacher included ( #5 ) Has child been referred for special class ? and ( #6 ) Has child repeated a grade ? The WRAT ( reading achievement test ) and PPVT were administered at the child interview . Scholastic achievement tests included Reading , Spelling , Language Arts , and Math . <p> Item analyses were computed on each of these measures . Items with an item-total correlation of less than .2 were excluded . Items with a variance of less than 20% were also excluded . Variables were computed for the scale by taking the mean whenever 60% or more of the items in that scale were not missing . The PPVT was dropped from the analysis because it is not an academic achievement test , but rather an IQ test . The child skill items were also eliminated so that they might be used as an indicator of child self-esteem . <p> Antisocial Behavior . A diverse array of variables was included and analyzed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the CBCL , telephone interviews , and teachers ' self-reports about the student 's behavior patterns . Examples of representative items are as follows : CBCL-Parent : Overt Antisocial ( #3 ) Argues a lot ( #22 ) Disobedient at home ( #90 ) Swearing or obscene language CBCL-Parent : Covert Antisocial ( #20 ) Destroys his own things ( #81 ) Steals at home ( #101 ) Truancy , skips school CBCL-Teacher : Overt Antisocial ( #3 ) Argues a lot ( #23 ) Disobedient at school CBCL-Teacher : Covert Antisocial ( #20 ) Destroys his own things ( #82 ) Steals ( #101 ) Unexplained absences Child Telephone Interview : Overt Antisocial ( e.g. , In the last 24 hours , did you : ) ( #15 ) Argue with an adult ? ( #20 ) Tease anyone ? ( #22 ) Hit siblings ? Child Telephone Interview : Covert Antisocial ( e.g. , In the last 3 days did you : ) ( #24 ) Tell a lie ? ( #25 ) Get in trouble at school ? Teacher ( #11 ) How often does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( #21 ) How likely is it that the student will have future police trouble ? ( #22 ) Target child has tattoos <p> Delinquency . Variables used in deriving this construct score included both the Major Index Scale ( Giordano &; Cernkovich , 1979 ) and the Elliott Self-Report Delinquency Scale ( Elliott , 1983 ) . Sample items included Major Offenses Scale ( #5 ) Stole motor vehicle ( #20 ) Sexual assault ( #27 ) Sold hard drugs Minor Offenses Scale ( #1 ) Damaged family property ( #8 ) Arson ( #41 ) Obscene calls Number of Arrests During the Wave <p> Substance Use . Sample items from variables used in this construct included Boy 's Substance Use ( #1 ) Has he used tobacco ( #3 ) Has he used beer or wine ( #316 ) Behavior suggests he is trying drugs Peer Task Coder Impressions ( #34 ) TC referred to alcohol use ( #36 ) TC referred to marijuana use Child Interview : Substance Consumption ( #36 ) When drinking , do you usually get high ? ( #37 ) How high ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Child uses drugs , alcohol CBCL-Parent ( #105 ) Child uses drugs , alcohol Parent Telephone Interview Child Telephone Interview <p> Items with an item-total correlation of less than .2 were excluded . Due to the nature of this particular construct , inclusion of low base-rate items was considered important . Items with a variance of less than 20% were not excluded for that reason . As before , variables were computed for the scale by taking the mean whenever 60% or more of the items in that scale were present . <p> Deviant Peer . The role of deviant peer affiliations in relation to boys ' antisocial behavior is of critical importance and has been discussed in detail elsewhere ( Dishion , 1987 ; Patterson , et al. , 1992 ) . The Deviant Peer construct assessed peer-related behavior such as drug use and stealing , and it was defined by three indicators . Two of the indicators -- Parent Reports of Overt/ Covert Child Behavior and Peer Nominations -- consisted of a single item . The third indicator was the child 's report of friends ' substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this construct , with the indicators correlating in the .10 to .28 range . It was hypothesized that deviant peer groups are not strong for the 9- to 10-year-old age groups , but that the internal validity of the deviant peer construct increases as the boys enter adolescence . <p> Examples of variables used included CBCL-Parent ( #39 ) Hangs around with children who get in trouble CBCL-Teacher ( #39 ) Hangs around with others who get in trouble Parent OCA questionnaire ( #29 ) Does he hang out with kids who steal ? Child Interview : Substance Use ( #16 ) Do you have friends your age who drink alcohol ? ( #16A ) What do they drink ? ( #16B ) Do they ever get drunk ? ( #16C ) How often do your friends drink ? Child Interview : Peer Behavior ( e.g. , During the last year , how many of your friends have : ) ( #1 ) Cheated on school tests ? ( #2 ) Ruined or damaged something on purpose that was n't theirs ? Peer Nominations ( #17 ) Kids who belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Competence and School Adjustment . In addition to the measures administered and completed under the auspices of Patterson and his colleagues at OSLC , the Walker-McConnell Scale of Social Competence and School Adjustment ( Walker &; McConnell , 1995 ) was completed on the Walker subsample by participants ' teachers in the fall of the fifth grade . The elementary-age version of the Walker-McConnell scale consists of 43 items relating to the social adjustment of children ( Grades K-6 ) in school settings , which load on one of three factors . Factor 1 , Teacher-Preferred Social Behavior , consists of 16 items relating to interacting with teachers ( e.g. , shows sympathy for others ) . Factor 2 , Peer-Preferred Social Behavior , consists of 17 items relating to peer interactions ( e.g. , makes friends easily with other children ) . Factor 3 , School Adjustment Behavior , consists of 10 items relating to teacher management of the classroom ( e.g. , attends to assigned task ) . All items are scored on a 5-point scale of frequency of occurrence , with total scores on each factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Walker-McConnell scale was developed over a five-year period and initially standardized with a sample of 762 cases ; the final standardization sample consisted of 1,800 cases . The scale has excellent internal consistency and interjudge reliability ( indexes above .90 for all three factors ) and discriminates powerfully between clinical and nonclinical samples across multiple validation studies . Prediction Model <p> Correlations and significance levels between the constructs and the criterion variable were highly statistically significant , and all but one of the correlations were in the " moderate " to " large " statistical effect sizes ( Cohen , 1988 ) . The directions of the associations were consistent with our initial theoretical suppositions , with constructs measuring antisocial behavior being correlated positively with the outcome variable and constructs measuring academic performance and social skills ratings being associated negatively with the outcome variable . That is , persons who scored high on the antisocial constructs tended to score higher on the outcome variable and persons who scored high on the Academic Skills constructs and Social Skills scale tended to score lower on the outcome variable . Outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsample was used as the major criterion variable in this study . Data for this variable were derived from the official databases of police or court reports . Each report listed the date of the offense or court proceeding , date of disposition , the actual disposition , date of final disposition , and the final disposition . The possibility existed that multiple offenses had been listed from the same police or court report , thereby sharing the same dispositions and disposition dates . Also , multiple reports having different dispositions and disposition dates could have been made on the same date . A trained data collector assigned each offense a unique four-digit code based on the definition of offense codes used in the state court system . This assignment was direct and required little inference , thereby minimizing error . Additional offense variables were required when there were multiple charges stemming from one report . For example , if the date of offense , disposition date , and disposition were the same , the offense most often resulted in a different code for these multiple charges . A comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . <p> We established six levels for the outcome variable : 0 = no dispositions , 1= one minor disposition , 2 = one serious disposition , 3 = two serious dispositions , 4 = three serious dispositions , and 5 = four or more serious dispositions . However , dispositions were counted only if their severity score was greater than zero for purposes of compiling the outcome variable . Examples of typical minor dispositions include traffic offenses and minor found to be in possession of alcoholic beverage who was given probation . Examples of serious dispositions include resisting arrest , burglary , unauthorized use of motor vehicle , assault , and theft . A typical record for a participant from this database is provided in Table 2 . Analyses <p> As noted previously , a total of 76 participants from the original Walker subsample of 80 subjects were included in the analyses for this study . We first computed a series of univariate Pearson product-moment correlations between the construct scores at the different data collection waves and the scalar criterion . We then used a stepwise multiple-regression procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their association with the outcome variable to create a predictor model ( Cohen &; Cohen , 1983 ) . That is , the predictor variable that had the strongest statistical association with the outcome variable was selected into the prediction model first ; the second strongest predictor variable was then added into the model , and so forth . Variables that were not added to the model were those variables where the explanatory variance on the outcome criterion ceased to be statistically significant at the .05 alpha level , as determined by an F test for the multiple-regression procedure . <p> Following the recommendations of Cohen and Cohen ( 1983 ) , we identified " outliers " -- participants who scored roughly 3 or more standard deviations above or below the standardized mean of the outcome variable . We did this to gain a greater understanding of the nuances of the predictor model and to pinpoint where in the prediction process the model failed . We correlated the residuals with the variables included in the predictor model and the criterion variable , and we then examined each outlier case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are presented in Table 3 . The final model contained five predictor variables that exhibited an R2 value of .803 and a multiple R value of .896 . This result is considered to be a large statistical effect , according to Cohen 's magnitude criteria ( Cohen , 1988 ) . To adjust the initial R2 value for chance fluctuations in the analysis , we applied a shrinkage formula suggested by Cohen and Cohen ( 1983 ) . This formula yielded a " shrunken " R2 value of .786 and a shrunken R of .887 . Even with the application of this conservative statistical procedure , the resulting relationship would be considered a large statistical effect ( Cohen , 1988 ) . <p> The first , and strongest , variable in the model was the Deviant Peer construct as measured at Data Collection Wave 4 , which was roughly 3 years after the inception of the study . The next two variables included in the model were the Delinquency construct and the Antisocial Behavior construct , both collected at Data Collection Wave 6 , which was approximately 5 years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into the model were the Peer and School subscale scores from the Walker-McConnell measure , which were collected at a single timepoint during the fifth-grade year for participants . Residual Analysis <p> The mean standardized predicted criterion score was .22 ( SD = 1.12 , range = -2.11-3.73 ) , and the mean standardized residual score was .09 ( SD = 1.36 , range = -3.49-3.12 ) . The correlations between the residual scores and the predictor variables are presented in Table 4 . <p> Residual scores for the entire study sample are correlated with the five variables selected for the final prediction model . The residual scores were relatively uncorrelated with the predictor variables , confirming the close relationship of the final prediction model to the outcome criterion . The seven individuals who were identified as outliers are profiled in Table 5 . Each individual 's scores on the variables included in the final prediction model are presented . <p> Three cases were overpredicted by the final regression model ( i.e. , it was thought that these persons would have more serious arrest records than they actually did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 would have a score of 2.9 on the outcome variable , but his score was 0 , because he had no formal arrests on his record at the 11th grade . For this participant , the most important result was his relatively high scores ( above the sample means for each factor ) on the two Walker-McConnell subscales . For Case 56 , the model predicted an extremely high level of antisocial behavior on the outcome variable ( 7.4 ) . Even though the model overpredicted this participant 's actual status ( 5 ) , this status represents the most extreme end of the outcome variable ; thus , the overprediction discrepancy may be attributed to a ceiling effect . Case 56 had exceptionally high scores on the antisocial variables in the model , a relatively high score on the Walker-McConnell Peer subscale ( above the sample mean ) , and a low score on the Walker-McConnell School subscale ( below the sample mean ) . The model predicted that Case 66 would score 4.3 on the outcome variable , but his actual score was 2 . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score on the Walker-McConnell School subscale ( almost 3 standard deviations below the sample mean ) but relatively high scores on the Walker-McConnell Peer subscale ( above the sample mean ) . <p> The final regression model under predicted four cases ( i.e. , it was anticipated that these participants would present less extreme arrest records than they actually did ) . For Case 62 , the model predicted a score of-.6 on the outcome variable ( his actual score was 2 ) . In this person 's profile the component that stands out is his relatively high score on the Antisocial Behavior construct at Data Collection Wave 6 . Case 60 was predicted to score -.5 on the outcome variable but scored 2 . His profile shows low scores on the three peer and antisocial factors and scores lower than the sample averages on the two Walker-McConnell subscales . Case 25 was predicted to score 2.6 and exhibited an actual score of 5 . His performance on the Walker-McConnell Peer subscale was lower than the sample mean , and his score on the Walker-McConnell School subscale was much lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the sample mean ) . Finally , the model predicted a score of 2.7 on the outcome variable for Case 4 , but his actual score was 5 . This participant had an elevated score on the Antisocial Behavior construct and a low score on the Walker-McConnell School subscale ( 1 standard deviation below the sample mean ) . DISCUSSION <p> This study was conducted in the Pacific Northwest with a small group of predominantly White participants ; thus , the external validity of the results may be limited to this geographic area and this population . Two other points also should be noted : The study was correlational in design , and the results should not be construed as causal in nature ; The outcome variable was based on formal arrest records , which may underestimate the actual rate of antisocial and/or criminal acts within this sample because only a small number of acts for which an individual could be arrested actually come to the attention of the authorities and are formally addressed by the legal system ( Hindelang et al. , 1979 ) . <p> Clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding generalization of its results to other settings and populations . On the other hand , the care taken in choosing the sample , the comprehensive and carefully constructed measures used , and the high response rates evident in the longitudinal data-collection process provide ample support for the internal validity of the findings ( Capaldi &; Patterson , 1989 ; Patterson et al. , 1992 ) . Findings <p> The predictive power of the first variable in the model , association with deviant peers in Grade 8 , is somewhat startling and by itself accounts for almost 57% of the variance in the outcome variable of arrest status at Grade 11 . This relationship is even more impressive given that data for the outcome variable were collected 3 years after this particular predictor variable was assessed . The strong relationship existing between an individual 's having friends who engage in antisocial behavioral acts and that individual 's performance of similar acts has been well-documented through correlational procedures ( Dishion , Loeber , Stouthamer-Loeber , &; Patterson , 1984 ) and is fully consistent with folk-wisdom handed down by generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction model were Delinquency and Antisocial Behavior at Data Collection Wave 6 . The inclusion of these constructs in the prediction model provided support for the interrelationship of different forms of antisocial behaviors ( e.g. , petty crime ) and at-risk behaviors ( e.g. , use of obscene language , noncompliance with instructions of parent and authority figures ; Donovan &; Jessor , 1985 ) with more extreme forms of antisocial behavior , as reflected in formal arrest records . As these data were gathered at roughly the 8th-grade level , their relationship with more extreme forms of antisocial behavior in the 11th grade is indicative of a progressive , escalating pattern of deviant behavior occurring over the developmental continuum . This form of developmental psychopathology ( from age-specific forms of aberrant behavior to socially unacceptable and/or dangerous actions ) has been well documented in the literature as a way of conceptualizing and understanding these at-risk behaviors ( e.g. , Lewis &; Miller , 1990 ) . <p> Finally , the last two variables in the model , the Walker-McConnell Peer and School subscale scores gathered during the fifth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outcome variable ) , suggest the importance of peer relationships and school performance in accounting for arrest status in the adolescent years . These findings are consistent with other findings in the literature regarding the correlation of social skills and peer acceptance during childhood with adjustment in later life ( Parker &; Asher , 1987 ) and with the often-cited connection between academic skills and antisocial/criminal behavior exhibited in later life ( Cornwall &; Bawden , 1992 ) . <p> The descriptive profiles of the seven outlier cases provide an interesting profile of participants who did not perform as predicted . The extreme nature of the study sample , coupled with the absence of a comparison sample of persons who were not judged to be at risk , limits our ability to interpret these cases . Interpretation is also hampered by a lack of personal , in-depth knowledge of these persons . Rutter ( 1988 ) recommended that in order to truly understand and make sense of antisocial behavior in individuals , empirical data derived from group studies must be combined with individual clinical observations and awareness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future research . First , the replication of this study in other settings and with samples composed of a higher percentage of persons representing cultural/ethnic minorities is essential for confirming the external validity of the results . Further , including comparison samples of peers judged not to be at risk for developing antisocial behavior patterns may help clarify interpretation of the profiles of the current at-risk participants . It would be interesting to examine association of the variables we selected as predictors with self-reports of antisocial behavior instead of formal arrest records . As mentioned earlier , these records reflect only a relatively small percentage of the antisocial acts performed by at-risk persons ( Hindelang et al. , 1979 ) . It may well be that self-report of antisocial behavior could change the ordering of at-risk participants on a summary antisocial behavior variable ( e.g. , youth with less extreme arrest records may self-report more frequent episodes of antisocial behavior and of a more serious form ) and lead to different associations of the predictor variables with such an outcome variable . Given the relative power of Peer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable in this study , it would have been useful to have included these same measures , or similar school-based measures , in order to provide a more complete profile of the sample in the same way as their community and antisocial behaviors were described . If schools are to serve as sites for effective interventions with these types of students , the students ' school-based performance must be assessed and longitudinal data for them must be gathered and carefully studied ( Rutter , 1988 ) . <p> The impact of the timing of school-based delivery of interventions for antisocial students should also be studied . There is a common belief among practitioners and academicians that interventions for at-risk populations should begin as early as possible and continue over a number of years in order to demonstrate positive results ( Zigler , Taussig , &; Black , 1992 ) . However , most interventions for these groups , especially within school contexts , begin only when the individual " steps over " some legal , social , or educational line by exhibiting behavior beyond the accepted standard(s) of the organization(s) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as during middle or high school years ) , after these forms of behavior have become entrenched in cognitive and performance patterns , would have less powerful effects than interventions offered earlier in the developmental progression ( Walker &; Bullis , 1995 ) . Other evidence suggests that adolescence can be an appropriate point to intervene with at-risk individuals , however , because this is a time when many youth are ready and able to change ( Albee , 1982 ; Hobbs &; Robinson , 1982 ; Kazdin , 1993 ) . <p> We believe that interventions for the at-risk population often suffer from a lack of treatment fidelity , particularly when administered within school settings . That is , proven interventions are provided in ways that deviate from the manner in which they were originally developed and result in weaker applications ( Kazdin , 1987 ) . Any experimental study of these interventions should address treatment fidelity directly in a comprehensive measurement system in order to document implementation procedures when applied in " scaled up " versions of the intervention . <p> The association between antisocial peers and arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points to the importance of pairing at-risk youth with peers who can model appropriate social behavior and , hopefully , shape and support them . Such mentoring/ affiliation programs could be focused on either school or peer-controlled contexts ( Dryfoos , 1990 ) and , whenever possible , should include the family in monitoring the child 's associations with other children ( Patterson , 1982 ) . <p> As school is a primary socialization environment for children and youth , the impact of offering socializing experiences with typically developing peers through intensive learning experiences should be explored as well ( Coie &; Krebiehl , 1984 ; Coie , Underwood , &; Lochman , 1991 ) . Many well-designed and carefully developed interventions exist and would have substantial applicability for meeting both the social-behavioral and academic instructional needs of this population ( e.g. , Carnine &; Kameenui , 1992 ; Deshler &; Schumaker , 1986 ) . In addition , at-risk students who are likely to become juvenile offenders are often in desperate need of ( a ) social skills training relative to the school context ( Hazel , Schumaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &; Greenwood , 1981 ) and ( b ) exposure to wraparound services provided by community agencies based in the school setting ( e.g. , Dryfoos , 1993 ; Epstein et al. , 1993 ) . The exact timing of these services , the way in which they are offered , the combination of services yielding the most positive effects , and their differential impact on subgroups of students ( e.g. , English speaking vs . English as a second language ) should also be examined through research . <p> Greenwood , Model , Rydell , and Chiesa ( 1996 ) analyzed the cost-effectiveness of different strategies in diverting at-risk youth from a life of crime . Their comparisons of ( a ) home visits and daycare , ( b ) parent training , ( c ) graduation incentives , ( d ) delinquent supervision , and ( e ) incarceration indicated that providing graduation incentives is clearly the most cost-effective in terms of preventing the commission of serious crimes by these youth . This finding highlights one of the key roles schools can play in responding effectively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relatively dismal record of intervention outcomes achieved so far with this population , it seems clear that comprehensive school-based interventions should be coupled with family-oriented interventions and community-based wraparound programs in order to maximize the impact of such efforts ( Kazdin , 1987 ; Reid , 1993 ) . Just as school-based interventions alone will not have maximum positive impact for atrisk children and youth , interventions focused and delivered outside the school setting are likely to have a similar result . Interventions for this population must be as comprehensive and long-term as possible to achieve socially valid outcomes .

@@4020241 Section : ORIGINAL ARTICLE <p> We conducted a study of 91 patients with severe-to-profound asymmetric hearing loss to assess their satisfaction with digital contralateral routing of signal ( CROS ) or bilateral contralateral routing of signal ( BiCROS ) hearing aids . Satisfaction was evaluated on the basis of the number of patients who elected to purchase their hearing aid following a free 30-day trial and on the results of a subsequent 8-question survey . We found that overall patient satisfaction was generally high . At the end of the 30-day trial , 66 of the 91 patients ( 72.5% ) elected to keep their CROS or BiCROS device , a percentage that is far greater than the acceptance rates of 10 to 20% that had been previously reported with older models of the CROS and BiCROS devices . According to the survey responses , those who kept their devices gave them an overall rating of 3.4 on a scale of 1 ( very dissatisfied ) to 5 ( very satisfied ) ; those who returned their devices gave them an overall rating of 1.9 . Introduction <p> Traditionally , the medical community has not demanded the same level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficits as it has for patients with symmetric bilateral deficits . In fact , a still common recommendation for such patients is nothing more than to sit close to and turn the better-hearing ear toward the sound source . However , we do know that individuals with unilateral or asymmetric hearing loss can experience a wide range of hearing difficulties . The seriousness of these hearing deficits varies , depending on the nature and degree of the loss and individual work and social hearing demands. ( n1-n6 ) Not all individuals who experience these hearing deficits complain about them or seek treatment , but those who do often report difficulty listening when speech originates on the side of the worse-hearing ear , difficulty understanding speech in a noisy environment , and difficulty in locating the source of sound. ( n7 ) The unilateral listener usually has no difficulty communicating with only 1 person in a relatively quiet environment , but many listening situations occur in environments that include multiple individuals . <p> Several approaches to aural rehabilitation in patients with unilateral or asymmetric hearing loss have been suggested . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . These approaches include transcranial sound transmission via high-output in-the-ear or behind-the-ear hearing aids , semi-implantable bone-anchored hearing aids , and conventional contralateral routing of signal ( CROS ) or bilateral contralateral routing of signal ( BiCROS ) heating aids . <p> CROS and BiCROS devices traditionally have been used for patients with unilateral heating loss in an attempt to restore the " head shadow effect " and improve sound localization . However , these devices have not gained widespread acceptance for numerous reasons , including performance factors such as ineffectiveness in high ambient noise and distortion . Among the theories that have been proposed to explain the poor performance are inappropriate fitting , poor adjustment , and technical inadequacies . <p> The performance of CROS and BiCROS devices may improve as a result of developments in digital signal processing . In this article , we describe our study of patient satisfaction with the new digital CROS and BiCROS hearing aid systems . Our goals were to determine whether technologic advancements in digital signal processing have truly enhanced the efficacy of CROS and BiCROS devices and to identify any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted a case review of 104 patients at our institution who had severe-to-profound asymmetric hearing loss and poor speech discrimination scores ( <40% in the worse ear ) . Thirteen patients were excluded because they did not meet eligibility criteria . The remaining group of 91 patients was made up of 43 men and 48 women , aged 41 to 89 years ( mean : 70.6 ) . The causes of their hearing loss included Mnire 's disease , acoustic neuroma , autoimmune inner ear disease , temporal bone fracture , and noise exposure . All patients had undergone a full evaluation of their hearing loss , including audiometry , otoacoustic emission testing , electrocochleography , and brainstem-evoked response testing , depending on the individual 's underlying etiology . <p> Of the 91 patients , 9 were fitted with a corded CROS device and 82 with a BiCROS device ( figure 1 ) , either corded ( n = 73 ) or cordless ( n = 9 ) . No cordless CROS device was used in this study . The selection of the specific type of hearing aid was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and patient preference . <p> Figure 1 . Photographs show the behind-the-ear ( A ) and the in-the-ear ( B and C ) BiCROS hearing aid . <p> One week after fitting , patients returned for a follow-up adjustment . Modifications were based on sound-field testing and patient input . A second follow-up was conducted at the end of a free 30-day trial , at which time patients chose to either purchase their hearing aid or return it without being charged for its use . <p> Two weeks after the end of the 30-day trial , we mailed a questionnaire to all patients , regardless of whether they chose to keep their CROS or BiCROS device . Four weeks later , we mailed follow-up questionnaires to those patients who had not responded to the first questionnaire . Two weeks later , we placed telephone calls to those who had still not responded . <p> The survey was made up of 8 questions ( figure 2 ) .

Acceptance rates were high for both the CROS ( 66.7% ) and BiCROS ( 73.2% ) devices . The overall acceptance rate for the corded models ( 76.8% ) was high ; the acceptance rate for the cordless model was low ( 33.3% ) , but only a small number of patients had received a cordless device . <p> Among the reasons cited by the 25 patients for returning their device were ( 1 ) the new hearing aid was no better than their previous device , ( 2 ) the device was too complicated , ( 3 ) the device was too expensive , ( 4 ) use of the device was hindered by clinical circumstances such as otorrhea or otalgia ( meaning that the patient was not a good candidate for the device ) , and ( 5 ) the cord was bothersome . <p> Completed questionnaires were received from 34 of the 66 patients who accepted their hearing aid ( 51.5% ) and from 9 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining 48 patients , we were unable to contact 29 , and 19 declined to participate . Five of the 66 patients who had elected to purchase their hearing aid were not actually using it ; taking this finding into consideration , the true acceptance rate falls from 72.5 to 67.0% ( 61/91 ) . <p> The overall mean value for the responses to all 8 questions by all 43 respondents was 3.12 on the 5-point scale . The mean rating scores were 3.4 for those who kept their device ( table 2 ) and 1.9 for those who did not ( table 3 ) . The highest overall mean value was 3.6 for the BiCROS corded device , and the lowest was 1.1 for both the CROS and the BiCROS cordless models . Discussion <p> The original CROS hearing aid was described by Harford and Barry in 1965 as a prosthesis to assist hearing in patients who have one ear that is too impaired to be aided and the other that is normal or nearly normal. ( n8 ) One of the effects of the CROS device is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been demonstrated that significant decreases in sound pressure level occur when signals are presented from the poorer-hearing side of the skull . The amount of reduction in sound pressure level is frequency-dependent ; the greatest decreases occur at high frequencies ( shorter wavelengths ) -- that is , frequencies above 1,500 Hz by 7 to as much as 30 dB. ( n8-n10 ) Because consonants are the most informative speech elements and are characteristically carried in the high frequencies , speech understanding is significantly degraded in patients with significant reductions in sound pressure level . Speech discrimination is further impaired in patients with asymmetric hearing loss by ambient masking noise and the absence of binaural summation . Individuals with asymmetric heating loss experience significant decreases in sound localization , as well as understanding , in noise or with sound presented to the poorer side because of the head shadow effect . The head shadow effect is theoretically restored by placing a microphone in the poorer ear and routing sound to the better ear . <p> Modifications of the CROS system have included the introduction of dual microphones to mix and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ear. ( n4 , n7 ) Important to this setup is the use of open ear molds in the better ear to attenuate low-frequency sounds and reduce occlusion effects in that ear . The acoustic benefit of open ear molds and the high-frequency emphasis produced have been shown to improve speech intelligibility. ( n11 ) The additional benefit of permitting greater gain secondary to increased microphone and receiver distance has been postulated. ( n4 ) <p> Vague preliminary selection criteria for CROS candidacy were originally defined by Harford and Dodds. ( n4 ) Their criteria include ( 1 ) the presence of severe unilateral hearing loss with some accompanying loss in the better ear , although not enough to warrant an ordinary hearing aid ; ( 2 ) a high demand on listening ; and ( 3 ) a high level of patient motivation. ( n4 ) Harford and Barry added that ( 1 ) a patient 's age at the onset of hearing loss is not a factor in the degree of success or failure of CROS aids , ( 2 ) mild-gain instruments should suffice for CROS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping a patient decide whether to commit to a CROS device is his or her experience while actually using one during regular daily activities. ( n8 ) Additional research has been done in an attempt to better define the optimal CROS or BiCROS candidate and to improve methods of fitting these devices. ( n12-n15 ) <p> Despite system modifications , improvements in fitting methods , and some early reports ( n13 , n15 , n16 ) describing the benefits of CROS and BiCROS hearing aids , their use has remained limited , partly because other reports ( n12 , n14 , n17 ) and anecdotal accounts have detailed minimal benefits , numerous complaints , and low overall success rates . In addition , comparison studies of CROS and BiCROS with other methods of unilateral aural rehabilitation have found the former lacking. ( n18-n20 ) Common complaints include poor performance in high ambient noise and increased distortion . However , the relatively recent development of digital signal processing holds some promise for improving the CROS and BiCROS devices , although few studies have been performed . Although some problems have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent good-ear masking , the lack of success is most likely attributable to a complex set of variables that includes poor patient motivation , unrealistic expectations , limited impairment , and other as yet unidentified factors. ( n21 ) <p> Our study demonstrated that patient satisfaction with the new generation of digital CROS and BiCROS hearing aids was higher than that seen in previously reported studies . The acceptance rates in our study ranged from 33.3 to 78.1% , compared with only 10 to 20% for analog devices. ( n20 ) Furthermore , our study demonstrated that the corded devices are more popular than cordless models , which is consistent with other reports in the literature. ( n20 ) <p> In addition to the benefits of digital technology , the high level of acceptance of these hearing aids in our study can be attributed to appropriate candidate selection , proper fitting , and close follow-up . Therefore , we believe that CROS and BiCROS corded heating aids should again be offered as a viable alternative for patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss .

@@4017341 Introduction <p> Long-term trends in the abundance and distribution of several pinniped species and commercially important fisheries of New England and the contiguous U.S. west coast are reviewed , and their actual and potential interactions discussed . Emphasis is on biological interactions or competition . The pinnipeds include the western North Atlantic stock of harbor seals , Phoca vitulina concolor ; western North Atlantic gray seals , Halochoerus grypus ; the U.S. stock of California sea lions , Zalophus californianus californianus ; the eastern stock of Steller sea lions , Eumetopias jubatus ; and Pacific harbor seals , Phoca vitulina richardii . Fisheries included are those for Atlantic cod , Gadus morhua ; silver hake , Merluccius bilinearis ; Atlantic herring , Clupea harengus ; the coastal stock of Pacific whiting , Merluccius productus ; market squid , Loligo opalescens ; northern anchovy , Engraulis mordax ; Pacific herring , Clupea pallasi ; and Pacific sardine , Sardinops sagax . Most of these pinniped populations have grown exponentially since passage of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972 . They exploit a broad prey assemblage that includes several commercially valuable species . Direct competition with fisheries is therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable fish . The expanding pinniped populations , fluctuations in commercial fish biomass , and level of exploitation by the fisheries may affect this potential for competition . Concerns over pinnipeds impacting fisheries ( especially those with localized spawning stocks or at low biomass levels ) are more prevalent than concerns over fisheries ' impacts on pinnipeds . This review provides a framework to further evaluate potential biological interactions between these pinniped populations and the commercial fisheries with which they occur . <p> Most U.S. pinniped populations have increased dramatically since passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act ( MMPA ) in 1972 , precipitating concern over the potential for competition with humans for resources . Pinniped and fisheries interactions have subsequently gained attention in recent years ( Beddington et al. , 1985 ; NMFS , 1997a ; Stone et al. , 1997 ) . These interactions are characterized as being either operational ( direct ) or biological ( indirect ) ( Lowry , 1982 ) . <p> Operational interactions include entanglement in fishing gear or debris , incidental take , and shooting by fishermen . Biological interactions are typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and include prey competition , changes in prey size structure , changes in prey distribution , or changes in community composition resulting from fishery harvests ( Lowry , 1982 ; Beverton , 1985 ; Harwood , 1987 ; NMFS1 ) . Two types of biological interactions are exploitative competition and interactive competition . The former involves direct competition for a particular prey , while the latter involves abandonment of a foraging area because of disturbance by a fishery , disruption of foraging patterns by fishing activities , or diminished foraging effectiveness because of disrupted prey aggregations ( NMFS1 ) . <p> Operational interactions are well documented ( Beddington et al. , 1985 ; Ferez and Loughlin , 1991 ; Wickens , 1995 ; Woodley and Lavigne2 ) and comparatively straight forward and quantifiable ( Lowry , 1982 ) . Fishery caused mortality and serious injury are presented in National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) marine mammal stock assessment reports ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ; Barlow et al. , 1998 ; Hill and DeMaster , 1998 ; Waring et al. , 1999a ) . <p> Biological interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing concern . Much emphasis has been on the competitive effects of pinnipeds on commercial fisheries , rather than the reverse ( Gulland , 1987 ; DeMaster and Sisson , 1992 ; Harwood , 1992 ; Haug and Nilssen , 1995 ; Mohn and Bowen , 1996 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . This emphasis is largely a result of increasing pinniped populations in regions of overexploited fish stocks and the potential economic impacts of resource competition . <p> The primary biological mechanism by which a fishery can adversely impact a marine mammal population is by altering its prey availability ( Beverton , 1985 ) , the effects of which are complex and difficult to establish conclusively ( Lowry and Frost , 1985 ) . The potential for exploitative competition depends on the spatial and temporal distribution of the fishery , the size-class targeted by the fishery , population size of the " competing " pinnipeds , their prey preferences , and the availability of alternative prey ( NRC , 1996 ) . <p> There are few documented cases of commercial fisheries impacting pinniped populations , partly because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large reductions in the Barents Sea stocks of herring in the 1960 's , polar cod in the early 1970 's , and capelin in the mid 1980 's produced observed changes in the Barents Sea harp seal population ( Haug and Nilssen , 1995 ; Timoshenko , 1995 ) . ( Please refer to Tables 1 and 2 for a list of the common and scientific names for all marine mammals , fish , and invertebrates mentioned in this review ) . Food limitations precipitated by the collapse of the capelin stock led to increased harp seal juvenile mortality and a mass movement of harp seals into Norwegian coastal waters during the late 1980 's ( Haug and Nilssen , 1995 ; Timoshenko , 1995 ) . A subsequent resurgence of Norwegian spring spawning herring helped mitigate these effects by the early 1990 's ( Haug and Nilssen , 1995 ) . <p> The large-scale walleye pollock and Atka mackerel fisheries of the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area have been implicated by some as causal agents in the continued decline of the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NMFS1 ) . The western stock has declined by 80% since the 1970 's , prompting a listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) in 1990 ( NMFS , 1990 ) and then as endangered in 1997 ( NMFS , 1997b ) . Walleye pollock and Atka mackerel have been the principal prey items of Steller sea lions in that region since at least the 1970 's ; the prevalence of walleye pollock in the diet decreases east to west where it is replaced by Atka mackerel ( Merrick and Calkins , 1996 ; Merrick et al. , 1997 ) . Because these commercially exploited species constitute a large percentage of the Steller sea lion diet , prey overlap and the potential for biological interactions may be substantial . <p> The continued decline of Steller sea lions and the concern over fisheries impacts has led to many fisheries management actions since 1991 . The December 1998 ESA Section 7 Consultation-Biological Opinion concluded that both the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock fisheries were likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the western stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NMFS1 ) . <p> The possibility that the continued Steller sea lion decline may be , at least partly , caused by biological interactions with important commercial fisheries has inspired this review of trends in abundance and distribution of pinnipeds and their potential interactions with several fisheries of New England and the contiguous United States west coast . Greater emphasis is on biological interactions ; operational interactions are only briefly noted . Biological interactions , however , are difficult to prove unequivocally and making such determinations is beyond the scope of this review . Materials and Methods <p> We have reviewed several pinniped species and commercial fisheries of New England , including the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank ( Fig. 1 ) , and the contiguous U.S. west coast and California Current ecosystem ( Fig. 2 ) for the period 1970-98 . Most of the species described are transboundary species , so Canadian data are occasionally included for either additive or comparative purposes . <p> The pinnipeds discussed are the western North Atlantic stocks of harbor seals and gray seals for New England waters , and the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steller sea lions as defined by Loughlin ( 1997 ) , and Pacific harbor seals for the U.S. west coast ( Table 3 ) . Information on stock definition and distribution , seasonal movements and migrations , population counts and growth trends , stock status , and food habits is summarized for each species . Population data are based on counts , rather than corrected population estimates , and as such , represent minimum population estimates . <p> Fisheries were selected based on two criteria : 1 ) they were of relatively large scale and economic significance , either historically or presently , and 2 ) the target species was a dominant prey of the selected pinnipeds . The New England fisheries chosen were Atlantic cod , silver hake , and Atlantic herring . West coast fisheries selected were Pacific whiting , market squid , northern anchovy , Pacific herring , and Pacific sardine . Information included basic life history and distribution , description and history of the fishery , stock status including biomass ( spawning stock biomass or total biomass ) and exploitation rate , and pertinent management measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ) ; data originally listed as either pounds or short tons were converted to metric tons . The fisheries are summarized in Table 4 . New England Pinnipeds <p> Four pinniped species occur in New England : harbor seals , gray seals , harp seals , and , occasionally , hooded seals . The former two are year-round residents ; occurrence of the latter two is recent , seasonal , and extralimital . The incidence of harp seal and hooded seal strandings in New England and incidental take in the New England sink gillnet fishery during the winter and spring increased since the 1980 's ( Kraus and Early , 1995 ; Waring et al. , 1999a ) . Sightings in the northern Gulf of Maine increased 92-fold since 1990 ( McAlpine et al. , 1999 ) . Reasons for this are uncertain ( Kraus and Early , 1995 ) , but collapsing fish stocks in regions where these seals commonly feed has been suggested ( McAlpine et al. , 1999 ) . Harp and hooded seals are considered vagrants in New England waters and will not be discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trends <p> The western North Atlantic stock of harbor seals ranges from Labrador to southern New England , with occasional sightings as far south as the Carolinas ( Richardson3 ) ; they constitute a single population ( Temte et al. , 1991 ; Waring et al. , 1999a ) . They occur year-round along the coasts of Maine and eastern Canada , and from late September through May from southern New England ( south of Maine ) to Long Island Sound ( Payne and Selzer , 1989 ; Katona et al. , 1993 ) . There is a general southward movement during fall ( Rosenfeld et al. , 1988 ) , and a northward migration in spring prior to pupping along the Maine coast ( Whitman and Payne , 1990 ; Kenney , 1994 ) . Pupping occurs in late May to early June , primarily on rocky ledges and islands in protected inlets and bays ; coastal Maine harbor seals tend to move offshore to more isolated ledges for molting in August ( Kenney , 1994 ; Richardson4 ) . <p> Massachusetts paid a bounty on harbor seals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fisheries ( Payne and Selzer , 1989 ) . Maine had a similar bounty that , despite being rescinded in 1905 , resulted in near extirpation of some localized populations . A bounty also existed in eastern Canada until 1976 ( Katona et al. , 1993 ) . The intense hunting pressure in Massachusetts apparently eliminated breeding activities there . Breeding and pupping are currently limited to coastal Maine ( Payne and Selzer , 1989 ; Temte et al. , 1991 ) . <p> Population estimates for the U.S. portion of this stock are derived from periodic aerial surveys of the Maine coast during the peak haulout period of pupping . These surveys have been conducted systematically since 1981 ( Kenney , 1994 ; Kenney and Gilbert5 ; Gilbert and Guldager6 ) . Richardson conducted coastwide surveys in 1972-73 and partial surveys in 1974-77 ( Richardson3 ; Richardson4 ; Richardson7 ) , but differences in coverage , timing , and methods preclude direct comparison with later censuses ( Kenney , 1994 ) . To illustrate general trends , however , these earlier counts are included in Figure 3 . Population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1994 ; Gilbert and Guldager6 ) . <p> The New England harbor seal population has nearly quintupled in size since passage of the MMPA ( Waring et al. , 1999a ) . Harbor seal counts in Maine grew from 10,540 at 334 haulout sites in 1981 to 30,990 at 584 haulout sites in 1997 ( Gilbert and Guldager6 ) ( Fig. 3 ) . The average annual rate of increase was 4.2% from 1981 to 1997,8.7% from 1981 to 1993 ( Kenney , 1994 ) , and 1.8% from 1993 to 1997 ( Gilbert and Guldager6 ) . The number of pups counted increased from 676 in 1981 to 5,359 in 1997 . The 1997 pup count was 26% higher than the 1993 count ( Gilbert and Guldager6 ) . The average annual increase in pups since 1981 was 12.9% ( Gilbert and Guldager6 ) . Although the population is increasing , its status relative to Optimum Sustainable Population ( OSP ) is unknown ( Waring et al. , 1999b ) . <p> General trends at winter haulouts in southern New England show a two-fold increase in seal numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Kraus and Early , 1995 ; Rough8 ) . The three largest concentrations in southern New England are around Cape Cod ( Jeremy Point , Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge , Nantucket Island ) , followed by the Isle of Shoals near the New Hampshire/ Maine border ( Payne and Selzer , 1989 ) . Monomoy supports the single largest concentration of harbor seals in eastern U.S. waters . Over 3,000 harbor seals were there in early May 1994 ( Payne and Selzer , 1989 ; Rough8 ) . Fishery-related Mortality <p> The New England multispecies sink gillnet fishery is responsible for the majority of the harbor seal incidental take in New England waters , with a mean average annual mortality of 934 seals from 1993 to 1997 ( Waring et al. , 1999b ) . Take occurs year-round , with its temporal and spatial distribution related to the seasonal distribution of both seals and the fishery . Incidental takes of harbor seals by the groundfish gillnet , herring purse seine , halibut tub trawl , and lobster fisheries are negligible ( Waring et al. , 1999a ) . Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor seals are limited in range and scope , and no prey studies have been done at Maine coast rookeries and haulout sites . The 24 species identified in stomach remains of the predominantly juvenile harbor seals incidentally caught in the New England sink gillnet fishery indicate a broad prey base that varies seasonally and regionally ( Williams , 1999 ) . Silver hake was the predominant year-round prey at 71% frequency of occurrence ( FO ) . Atlantic cod , Atlantic herring , red or white hake , redfish , pollock , alewife , and squids ( mostly Illex illecebrosus ) were also consumed ( >10% FO for each species ) , but these species varied more seasonally and regionally . <p> Prey remains from stomachs of seals stranded in southern New England included squid , haddock , silver hake , pollock , red hake , sand lance , and flatfish ( Selzer et al. , 1986 ) . Since many of these seals died during an influenza epidemic in 1980 , they may not represent normal prey habits . <p> Scats collected in southern New England during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated the diet ( up to 99% FO ) in the sandy Cape Cod area , whereas the more diverse diet at the rocky Isle of Shoals included rockfish , gadids , Atlantic herring , American plaice , and yellowtail flounder . Herring consumption near Cape Cod increased when sand lance availability decreased . Overall , sand lance constituted at least 55% FO of the winter diet in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts ( Payne and Selzer , 1989 ) . <p> Of the 23 taxa identified in stomachs collected at Grand Manan Island and eastern Nova Scotia , Can. , Atlantic herring , Atlantic cod , short-finned squid , and pollock constituted 72% of identified prey and 84% of estimated biomass consumed ( Bowen and Harrison , 1996 ) . Herring accounted for about 30% of biomass consumed . Frequency of occurrence varied seasonally , annually , and by age-group . Pups ate more herring and squid , seals older than 1 year ate more gadids and flatfish , and yearlings were intermediate between the two . Prey similarities between Grand Manan Island and eastern Maine are plausible based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abundance , and Population Trends <p> The western North Atlantic stock of gray seals ranges from Labrador , Can. , to Long Island , N.Y. , with occasional standings as far south as Virginia . The population center is in eastern Canada on Sable Island , Nova Scotia , which accounts for over one-half of the population , and in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence . Smaller populations occur in the United States around Nantucket Sound and central Maine ( Katona et al. , 1993 ; Rough8 ) . The southernmost breeding sites are those of Nantucket Sound , where Muskeget Island was the only known U.S. breeding site until 1990 ( Rough8 ) . In 1990 , pups were discovered on Monomoy Island ( Rough8 ) and in 1994 , a new breeding colony was discovered in Penobscot Bay , Maine ( Gilbert , 1995 ) . <p> Pupping occurs from late December to early February , after which gray seals typically disperse ( Stobo and Zwanenburg , 1990 ; Rough8 ) . They haulout again during molt beginning in early April in Nantucket Sound and May and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine are primarily on offshore ledges of the central coast ( Kenney , 1994 ; Richardson3 ; Gilbert et al. 9 ) and are thought to be from the Canadian population ( Gilbert and Guldager6 ) . Gray seals generally disperse again during late summer and fall ( Stobo et al. , 1990 ) . <p> Gray seals were considered extinct in the United States prior to 1958 , although about 40 were killed during the bounty hunt in Massachusetts in the 1940 's and 1950 's ( Andrews and Mott , 1967 ; Rough8 ) . Some were also likely taken during Maine 's bounty hunt ( Reeves et al. , 1992 ; Rough8 ) . Massachusetts passed legislation protecting gray seals in 1965 ( Andrews and Mott , 1967 ) and they received federal protection with the MMPA in 1972 . <p> Gray seals around Nantucket Sound were periodically monitored during the late 1960 's and 1970 's and regularly monitored since the 1980 's ( Richardson3 ; Rough8 ; Gilbert et al. 9 ) . Fewer than 17 gray seals were observed in any one year from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to 2,010 in 1994 ( Richardson3 ; Rough8 ; Gilbert et al. 9 ) ( Fig. 4 ) . From 1971 thru 1987 , only 6 pups were reported , 3 of which were standings . Pupping has since increased , from 12 born on Muskeget Island in 1992 to 59 in 1994 ( Rough8 ) . The nonpup population rise is likely due to immigration from Canada ( Rough8 ) . <p> Gray seals in Maine also increased . Richardson3 estimated approximately 80 in summer from 1965 to 1975 . A minimum of 600 gray seals were counted in 1993 ( Kenney , 1994 ; Gilbert , 1995 ; Kenney and Gilbert5 ) . Between 25 and 50 pups per year have been seen in Penobscot Bay since 1994 ( Gilbert10 ) . <p> Estimates of gray seal numbers for the entire western North Atlantic are not available , so U.S. and Canadian components are estimated separately . Waring et al . ( 1999a ) used 2,010 as the minimum abundance estimate for U.S. waters . In 1998 , the Atlantic Regional Scientific Review Group recommended against using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sable Island that winter around Nantucket ( Waring et al. , 1999b ) . Thus , there is currently no estimate for the number of gray seals in the United States and their status relative to optimum sustainable population ( OSP ) is unknown . Gray seal numbers appear to be increasing , but at an unknown rate ( Waring et al. , 1999b ) . In Canada , there is a minimum of 143,000 gray seals for Sable Island and the Gulf of St. Lawrence combined ( Waring et al. , 1999a ) , and numbers have been increasing . Sable Island pup production averaged roughly 13% per year from 1977 through 1993 ( Zwanenburg and Bowen , 1990 ; Mohn and Bowen , 1996 ) . Fishery-related Mortality <p> Known fishery-related mortality is low in U.S. waters and primarily involves the New England multispecies sink gillnet fishery . The average annual mortality for that fishery was 70 during 1993-97 ( Waring et al. , 1999b ) and occurred primarily in winter . Food Habits and Prey <p> The only prey information for gray seals in U.S. waters was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Prey consumed included windowpane flounder , silver hake , sand lance , skates , and gadids . <p> Gray seal prey habits in eastern Canada have been well assessed . Over 24 species , including sand lance , silver hake , Atlantic cod , capelin , and flatfish , were identified from scats collected on Sable Island ( Bowen and Harrison , 1994 ) . Atlantic herring , Atlantic cod , pollock , Atlantic mackerel , silver hake , and squid dominated the Grand Manan Island and eastern Nova Scotia diets ( Bowen et al. , 1993 ) . Prey habits in eastern Maine may be comparable to Grand Manan , given their geographic proximity . New England Fisheries <p> Significant changes have occurred in New England fisheries resources over the last 30 years . During the 1960 's and early 1970 's , fishing effort by foreign vessels off the U.S. northeast coast was high , with takes more than triple the average annual catch of U.S. fishermen ( Anthony , 1990 ) . Enactment of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act ( MFCMA ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response , the northeast domestic fishing fleet grew rapidly in numbers and vessel size ( Kitts et al. , 1998 ) . Domestic fishing effort doubled in New England between 1976 and 1983 , and stocks that had not been targeted by the foreign fleet quickly went from being underutilized to overexploited ( Anthony , 1990 ; Murawski et al. , 1999 ) . While the number of vessels participating in the groundfish fishery gradually declined after 1980 , it remains nearly twice the pre MFCMA size . Competition for resources escalated with the increase in vessels harvesting the rapidly filled quotas , resulting in many management problems and rapidly declining stocks . <p> Groundfish abundance began declining in the early 1980 's and reached record lows by the early 1990 's ( Murawski and Almeida , 1998 ) . Along with this declining trend came an increasing reliance on cod ( Murawski et al. , 1999 ) . But there have also been increased landings of nontraditional species like spiny dogfish and skates ( Murawski and Almeida , 1998 ) . Meanwhile , abundance of principal pelagics ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Over half of the 51 stocks reviewed in Murawski and Almeida ( 1998 ) are at low abundance levels , one-third are at medium levels , and only one-tenth are considered at high abundance . Two-thirds of the stocks are overexploited , one-fourth are fully exploited , and one-tenth are underexploited . Nearly three-fourths of New England 's principal groundfish stocks are overexploited , as are all those of the mid Atlantic ( New York-Virginia ) region ( Murawski and Almeida , 1998 ) . Further details regarding fish , fisheries , stock status , and management for select commercially important stocks in the northeast follow . Atlantic Cod <p> Atlantic cod range from North Carolina to Greenland in the northwest Atlantic . In U.S. waters , cod are assessed and managed as the Gulf of Maine stock and the Georges Bank and Southward stock ( Mayo and O'Brien , 1998 ) . The continental slope is the offshore boundary for cod along the coast of North America ( Bigelow and Schroeder , 1953 ) . Although cod are found at most depths throughout the year and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer months ( Bigelow and Schroeder , 1953 ; NEFSC11 ) . Spring distribution extends from Cape Cod across Georges Bank and up into the Bay of Fundy , with localized concentrations ; densities decrease and cod are more geographically isolated during fall ( Hunt et al. , 1999 ) . <p> Cod attain sexual maturity between ages 2 and 4 , with ages 2-5 dominating catches . They can grow to 130 cm long and 25-35 kg and may live >20 years . Spawning time varies somewhat by area , but it is generally between February and June ( Bigelow and Schroeder , 1953 ; Mayo and O'Brien , 1998 ; NEFMC , 1998a ) and in water depths <50 fathoms ( 100 m ) ( Bigelow and Schroeder , 1953 ) . <p> The Fishery Cod has been an important component of New England commercial fisheries for about 400 years . Originally a hook and line fishery , it ranged from Massachusetts inshore waters out to Georges Bank ( Bigelow and Schroeder , 1953 ) . Gillnets came into use in the 1880 's . The mechanized fishery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1900 's and led to increased landings ( Bigelow and Schroeder , 1953 ) . Today , commercial cod fisheries are conducted year-round principally with large-mesh otter trawls and sink gillnets . The Georges Bank fishery is dominated by otter trawls , while the Gulf of Maine fishery is more diversified . A large recreational cod fishery occurs during late summer in the lower Gulf of Maine and from late fall to early spring from Massachusetts southward ( Mayo and O'Brien , 1998 ) . <p> Gulf of Maine commercial landings averaged 5,5001 between 1960 and 1975 , averaged more than twice that from 1976 to 1985 , declined from 1986 to 1988 , then reached a record high of 17,8001 in 1991 . Landings decreased since then to 4,183 t in 1998 ( NEFMC , 1996 ; 1999c ; 1999d ; NEFSC11 ) ( Fig. 5 ) . The Gulf of Maine recreational fishery decreased from about 2,800 t in 1990 to 300 t in 1997 ( NEFSC11 ) . Georges Bank landings quadrupled between 1960 and 1980 ( NEFMC , 1996 ) , peaked at 57,000 t in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased through 1990 to 42,500 t ( U.S. and Canada ) . Landings dropped precipitously by 1995 , with a slight increase in 1997 ( NEFSC11 ) ( Fig. 6 ) . The U.S. accounted for 72% and Canada for 28% of the landings ( Mayo and O'Brien , 1998 ) . U.S. landings for 1998 were 6,9231 ( NEFMC , 1999d ) . Recreational catches averaged 3,7001 between 1979 and 1986 ( Mayo and O'Brien , 1998 ; NEFSC12 ) . <p> Discards of cod in the Gulf of Maine fishery reached 3,600 t in 1990 . Since 1993 , discards have decreased to 200-400 t/year ( Mayo and O'Brien , 1998 ; NEFSC11 ) . Discards occur in the Georges Bank fishery , but reliable estimates are unavailable ( NEFSC11 ) . Stock Status <p> Cod stock biomass in the Gulf of Maine is extremely low and in a state of collapse ( NEFMC , 1998a ) . Spawning stock biomass is low , fishing mortality is high , recruitment is poor , and the pre-recruit survival rate is low ( NEFSC11 ) . Overall , spawning stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected to continue declining ( NEFSC11 ) ( Fig. 5 ) . Recruitment has been poor since 1992 , with each succeeding year class roughly half the strength of the preceding year class ( NEFSC11 ) . Exploitation rates have remained high and , since 1983 , have been 2-3 times above the level needed to attain maximum spawning potential ( Mayo and O'Brien , 1998 ) . The mean exploitation rate from 1989 to 1997 was 59% ( NEFSC11 ) . Biomass surveys indicate a contracting cod distribution , with areas of high cod catches more narrowly distributed during 1994-98 than during 1979-83 ( NEFMC , 1998b ) . <p> The Georges Bank spawning stock biomass averaged 61,5001 for 1978-97 , from a high of 92,800 t in 1980 to a record low of 25,100 t in 1994 ( Fig. 6 ) . The exploitation rate for this stock averaged 40% from 1978 to 1997 . It peaked at 64% in 1994 , but dropped to 21% in 1997 ( NEFSC12 ) . Management <p> The U.S. Atlantic cod fisheries are managed under the New England Fishery Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FMP ) , which includes a complex of ten groundfish species . The FMP was established in 1986 and has been modified many times since . Its principal goal is to reduce fishing mortality sufficiently to allow stocks to rebuild . Management measures include time/area closures , gear restrictions , minimum size limits ( 19 inches for cod ) , a permit moratorium , days-at-sea restrictions , trip limits for the Gulf of Maine fishery , and a vessel buyout program ( Mayo and O'Brien , 1998 ; NMFS , 1999a ) . Several of these measures are summarized in NEFMC ( 1996 ) , ( 1998a ) , ( 1999c ) , ( 1999d ) , and ( 2000 ) . <p> Due to the critical state of the Gulf of Maine stock , a Stock Assessment Review Committee , comprised of U.S. and Canadian experts , recommended immediate reduction of fishing mortality by ending all directed fishing and minimizing bycatch ( NEFSC11 ) . They also recommended a substantial reduction in effort including 56% reduction of fishing mortality rates for Gulf of Maine cod stocks and 36% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Total Allowable Catch ( TAC ) for Georges Bank ( 4,700t ) and the Gulf of Maine ( 1,783t ) were both grossly exceeded in 1998 ( NEFMC , 1999c ) . Thus , proposed low trip limits , reduced TAC 's , and closed area extensions are being used to essentially create a by-catch-only fishery in the Gulf of Maine ( NEFMC , 1999c ) . <p> Time/area closures for the sink gillnet fishery were initiated in the mid 1990 's to protect harbor porpoise in New England coastal waters from Rhode Island to the Canadian border and in an offshore region adjacent to , and including , Cashes Ledge . The Northeast ( Penobscot Bay to the Canadian border ) and Massachusetts Bay Closure Areas were later closed to all gear for groundfish conservation beginning in 1996 and 1997 , respectively ( NEFMC , 1998a ) . Other area closures were implemented to protect right whales between 1 January and 15 May in Cape Cod Bay Federal waters and 1 April-30 June in the Great South Channel ( NEFMC , 1998a ) . Silver Hake <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina , but are most abundant from Nova Scotia to New York ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; Mayo , 1998 ) , and are typically in depths of less than 200 m ( Helser et al. , 1995 ) . Their distribution shifts seasonally , as most adults move offshore into deeper , outer-shelf and slope waters in the winter and spring , then into shallower coastal waters and banks during the summer and fall ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; Mayo , 1998 ) . The greatest concentrations of adults during the winter and spring are in the deep basins of the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine and along the continental slope from Sable Island to Cape Hatteras ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; Mayo , 1998 ) . Adults are more widespread in the summer and early fall , with concentrations over the shallower waters of northern Georges Bank and the inshore waters of the Gulf of Maine . Juveniles exhibit similar movement patterns , but generally in shallower waters ( Helser et al. , 1995 ) . <p> Within U.S. waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock and the Southern Georges Bank-Middle Atlantic ( southern ) stock ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; Mayo , 1998 ; Belles and Begg , 2000 ) . A separate stock ranges over the Scotian Shelf in Canadian waters ( Helser et al. , 1995 ) . <p> Spawning runs from May through November , starting earliest in the south and progressing northward ( Helser et al. , 1995 ) . It occurs throughout the range , with heaviest concentrations in the mid-Atlantic region between Cape Cod , Mass , and Montauk Point , N.Y. , on the southeastern slope of Georges Bank , and between Cape Cod and Grand Manan Island in the Gulf of Maine . Most silver hake mature between ages 2 ( 20-30 cm ) and 3 ( 25-35 cm ) ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; Mayo , 1998 ) . <p> Silver hake become increasingly piscivorous , even cannibalistic , with age and may exert some regulatory influence on other fish populations of the northeast continental shelf ecosystem . When hake is abundant , Atlantic mackerel and Atlantic herring stocks are low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helser et al. , 1995 ) . The Fishery <p> U.S. fishing efforts for groundfish increased in the Gulf of Maine , Georges Bank , and southern New England between 1976 and 1986 coinciding with a 72% decrease in silver hake biomass and a decline in U.S. landings ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; NEFMC , 1999b ) ( Fig. 7 ) . Distant water fleets ( DWF ) entered the fishery in 1962 and began a period of intense exploitation of groundfish stocks on Georges Bank and the Scotian Shelf ; silver hake was a principal target species . In just 3 years , the total take of hake reached 351,000 t , most of which was from the Gulf of Maine , northern Georges Bank , and mid-Atlantic areas . <p> Exploitation levels caused a decline in silver hake abundance and landings plummeted to 55,000 t by 1970 ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; Mayo , 1998 ) . With declining U.S. stocks , DWF efforts on the Scotian Shelf intensified ( NEFMC , 1999b ) . DWF take in U.S. waters after 1970 focused primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1970 to 1977 and reached 137,000 t in 1973 ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; Mayo , 1998 ) ( Fig. 7 ) . <p> Regulations imposed by the International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries in 1973 restricted the DWF fishery both temporally and spatially ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; NEFMC , 1999b ) . Implementation of the MFCMA further curtailed efforts ( Mayo , 1998 ) . The DWF fishery on the northern stock ended after 1977 , but not until 1987 for the southern stock where silver hake was primarily caught incidental to the squid fishery ( Mayo , 1998 ) . Stock status <p> Silver hake stocks were last assessed in 1990 ; there are no current estimates of stock size or spawning stock biomass ( NEFSC13 ; NEFMC , 1999b ) . Previous estimates show a downward trend for the southern stock and a generally downward , but fluctuating , trend for the northern stock . Spawning stock biomass for the southern stock was 650,000 t in 1965 , but the intensified DWF fishery caused a rapid decline to 150,000 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish in 1965 to less than 500 million by 1968 ( Helser et al. , 1995 ) . Survey biomass indices decreased by over 50% since 1985 and have been at record lows since the mid 1990 's . The DWF fishery similarly impacted the northern stock . Fishing mortality rates tripled between 1961 and 1964 . Spawning stock biomass decreased from 300,000 t in 1962 to very low levels in the 1970 's , and has been between 9,000 and 33,000 t since 1978 . Despite increases in biomass indices since 1980 , there has been no corresponding increase in the adult ( spawning stock ) biomass ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; Mayo , 1998 ; NEFSC13 ) . <p> The age structure of the stocks has become severely truncated and year classes are disappearing before becoming adults ( NEFMC , 1999b ) . A substantial juvenile mortality caused by consistently high discard rates in the otter trawl and northern shrimp fisheries may be impacting the adult populations , long-term yield , and spawning stock biomass ( Mayo , 1998 ; NEFMC , 1999b ) . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ages 1-2 ( NEFSC13 ) . Discard estimates for 1989-92 represented sizeable portions of each stock 's total landings ( NEFSC13 ) . <p> Fishing mortality rates increased substantially over the last 20 years ( NEFMC , 1999b ) . Since 1992 , the northern stock 's exploitation rate grew from 42% to about 65% ( Mayo , 1998 ; NEFMC , 1999b ) . The exploitation rate for the southern stock was 33% from 1978 to 1980,54% from 1983 to 1987 , and was recently estimated at 60% ( Mayo , 1998 ) . Both stocks are considered overexploited ( Mayo , 1998 ; NEFMC , 1999b ) . Management <p> Direct management of the U.S. silver hake fishery began with its addition to the Northeast Multispecies FMP in 1991 ( Helser et al. , 1995 ; NEFMC , 1999b ) . Amendment 12 to the FMP was submitted in February 1999 with the primary goal of decreasing silver hake exploitation by roughly 63% , to a target rate of 25% ( NEFMC , 1999b ) . The proposed action includes trip possession limits and mesh regulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shortening the Cultivator Shoal season by one month ( NEFMC , 1999b ) . Trip possession limits based on mesh size ( the larger the mesh , the higher the limit ) were developed as an incentive to use larger mesh sizes and reduce juvenile take . Also recommended is treating the northern and southern stocks as a single management unit , while continuing to manage the Cultivator Shoal fishery separately ( NEFMC , 1999b ) . Atlantic Herring <p> Atlantic herring range from North Carolina to the Canadian Maritime Provinces . Adults occur along the southern New England and mid-Atlantic coasts from the inshore waters out to the continental shelf break during late winter to early spring , migrate north into the Gulf of Maine to feed in the spring , segregate into spawning aggregations in late summer and fall , then migrate south again after spawning to overwinter in warmer waters ( Friedland , 1998 ; NEFMC , 1999a ) . <p> Maximum length is about 43 cm and maximum weight 680 g . Most fish mature by age 5 , some by age 3 ( Friedland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exploitable population is at about age 2 , the target age-group of the juvenile herring fishery ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . <p> Three major geographically distinct spawning stocks of Atlantic herring are on Georges Bank and Nantucket Shoals , in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Maine , and in the waters off southwest Nova Scotia ( Grosslein , 1987 ; Stevenson , 1998 ) . Each is further divided into smaller spawning areas that support discrete spawning aggregations ( Iles and Sinclair , 1982 ; Friedland , 1998 ) . Spawning occurs at depths of 10-100 m from late summer to fall , following a counter-clockwise progression from the northeastern Gulf of Maine around to Georges Bank ( Friedland , 1998 ; NEFMC , 1999a ) . <p> In 1991 , the two U.S. spawning stocks ( Georges Bank/Nantucket Shoals and Gulf of Maine ) were combined to form the coastal stock complex . This encompasses North Carolina to the Gulf of Maine , Georges Bank ( U.S. and Canadian portions ) , and the western Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick . U.S. management is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEFSC12 ) . The Fishery <p> The Maine herring fishery developed in the 19th century along with the sardine canning industry in northeastern Maine and the growth of the lobster fishery , for which herring were used as bait . Weirs were the most commonly used fixed gear until the 1940 's in eastern Maine and are still routinely used in New Brunswick . Stop seines became the dominant gear in the 1950 's as herring became more abundant along the coast of central Maine . Juvenile ( age 2 , 17 cm ) herring were the primary target of this fishery and remained so through the 1970 's . Purse seines gained importance after 1960 and continue to harvest an increasing percentage of the catch today . The majority of herring are either canned or used as lobster bait ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . <p> An adult herring fishery developed in the Jeffreys Ledge area in 1967 ( Anthony and Waring , 1980 ) and was supported by filleting and freezing plants that shipped the fish to West Germany . Southern New England and mid-Atlantic landings were relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEFMC , 1999a ) ; 1996 landings were 20,200 t , roughly 20% of the U.S. total ( Stevenson , 1998 ) . <p> The offshore foreign fishery began in 1961 with 100 Soviet vessels fishing Georges Bank . Between 1965 and 1972 , the number of foreign vessels fishing from Georges Bank to Cape Hatteras increased from 450 to over 1,000 . Most targeted herring . The foreign fleet consisted primarily of stern trawlers and side trawlers rigged for purse seining ( Anthony and Waring , 1980 ; NEFMC , 1999a ) . <p> This intense fishing pressure led to the collapse of the Georges Bank/Nantucket Shoals stock and fishery by the mid 1970 's ( Anthony and Waring , 1980 ; Friedland , 1998 ) . Estimated age 3+ biomass dropped from 1.2-1.35 million t in the late 1960 's to 400,000 t by the mid 1970 's ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . Landings steadily declined from 373,6001 in 1968 to less than 1,000 t in 1981 ( Friedland , 1998 ; NEFSC12 ) . Directed foreign fishing ended in 1982 . Mid-water trawlers recently returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1996 and over 6,000 t in 1997 ( NEFMC , 1999a ; NEFSC12 ) . <p> Unlike Georges Bank , landings from the Gulf of Maine stock have been relatively stable , averaging about 73,000 t since 1995 ( NEFSC12 ) . The total stock complex catch averaged 116,000 t since 1995 ( NEFSC12 ) ( Fig. 8 ) . <p> Declines in fixed gear use since 1982 changed the Maine coastal fishery . Purse seines and , increasingly , mid-water otter trawls now dominate the fishery . Pair trawls are also starting to be used ( NEFMC , 1999a ; NEFSC12 ) . Mobile gear use increased from less than 50% in the 1970 's to greater than 90% during the mid 1990 's ( Friedland , 1998 ) . <p> With this shift in gear usage , the proportion of juveniles harvested declined and the fishery is now more a mix of ages 2 , 3 , and 4+ fish . Since 1986 , the catch has been about 75% age 3+ fish ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . <p> The seasonal pattern of the fishery basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is active south of New England during winter ; there has been no winter fishing north of Cape Cod since 1993 ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . In spring , fishing shifts north into the offshore Gulf of Maine , then into the coastal Gulf of Maine in late summer/ early fall when herring move into these areas prior to spawning . Highest landings in the Gulf of Maine are from July through October , although herring are caught in Maine coastal waters from June to November . This coincides with spawning aggregations and the peak lobster season . Landings in Maine usually diminish by November and the fishery shifts south again ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . Recent Georges Bank catches have been made during summer to early fall ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . Most herring are caught off and landed in Maine , followed by Massachusetts and , recently , Rhode Island ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . Stock Status <p> The coastal stock complex has grown since the mid 1980 's and markedly so since the early 1990 's ( NEFSC12 ) ( Fig. 9 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georges Bank/Nantucket Shoals components of the stock complex ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . Total stock biomass increased from 500 , 000 t in 1992 to 2.9 million t in 1997 ( NEFMC , 1999a ; NEFSC12 ) . Spawning stock biomass increased from 143 , 000 t in 1990 to 1.8 million t in 1997 ( NEFMC , 1999a ; NEFSC11 ) . <p> Coincident to the rising biomass , the relative exploitation rate for the entire coastal stock complex declined from 67% in 1968 to 30% in 1990 to 4% in 1997 ( NEFSC11 ) . In contrast , annual harvest rates were 25-40% for the inshore waters of the Gulf of Maine where the herring fishery concentrated over the last 20 years ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . As a result , the Gulf of Maine component of the stock is fully exploited , if not overfished . The total coastal stock complex , however , is considered underexploited ( NEFMC , 1999a ; NEFSC12 ) . Management <p> Herring fishing is managed by NMFS , NEFMC , Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission ( ASMFC ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interjurisdictional fisheries and resources within state waters and is working with NEFMC to develop complimentary management measures for state and Federal waters . The Final Rule for the Atlantic Herring FMP was published by NMFS in December 2000 ( NMFS , 2000 ) . Maine , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and Rhode Island all have state specific regulations . <p> The NEFMC is taking a conservative approach under the new management plan by attempting to account for natural population fluctuations , ecosystem level considerations , such as predator-prey interactions , and the potential impacts of overfishing . In developing maximum sustainable yield ( MSY ) and target fishing mortality rates , there was an effort to include nonfishery sources of mortality , such as predation , including that by marine mammals . Because of potential overestimation of biomass , a precautionary approach was taken , allowing for slower development of the fishery and reducing the possibility for overfishing ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . West Coast Pinnipeds <p> U.S. west coast pinnipeds are the California sea lion , Steller sea lion , harbor seal , northern elephant seal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur seals are occasionally sighted in southern and central California offshore waters , and a female and pup were recently observed on San Miguel Island ( Melin and DeLong , 1999 ) . However , their only known breeding rookery is on Guadalupe Island , Mexico ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) , so they will not be discussed further . <p> Northern elephant seals and northern fur seals are also excluded from this report . They both breed and pup on some California islands ( fur seals only on San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands ) , but their distribution is generally more offshore , and both species widely disperse after the breeding season ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . California sea lions , Steller sea lions , and harbor seals are essentially year-round residents and are described in further detail below . California Sea Lion Distribution , Abundance , and Population Trends <p> California sea lions range from southern Mexico to Vancouver Island , B.C. ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ; Lowry et al. 14 ) . Three geographically distinct breeding stocks occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the U.S./Mexico border north into Canada ) is considered here ( Fig. 10 ) . The southern California Channel Islands ( Santa Barbara , San Nicolas , San Miguel , and San Clemente ) are principal breeding and pupping sites for this stock ( Lowry et al. 14 ) . California sea lions occasionally pup on the South Farallon Islands , where they are year-round residents , but fewer than 20 pups have been recorded there in the last 20 years ( Sydeman and Alien15 ) . Pupping takes place from late May to July , and peaks in mid-June . Breeding occurs in late June through July . <p> After the breeding season , adult and subadult males migrate north to the coasts of central and northern California , Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia and return to the rookeries in spring ( Lowry et al. 14 ) . Some immature sea lions undertake shorter migrations ( Huber , 1991 ) . The nonbreeding season range of adult females from the Channel Islands extends from southern California to the Farallon Islands ( Melin , 1995 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay year-round in southern California are primarily adult females , pups , and juveniles ( NMFS , 1997a ; Heath and Francis16 ) . Ao Nuevo Island in central California commonly supports a large nonbreeding sea lion population ( NMFS , 1997a ; Melin et al. 17 ) . The largest concentrations in central/ northern California waters are usually found on the Farallon Islands in the fall and spring during migration before and after the breeding season ( Huber , 1991 ) . Only males haulout north of the Farallones ( Melin et al. 17 ) ( Fig. 10 ) . <p> California sea lions are found in Oregon waters from mid-August through mid-June , absent only during the peak breeding season ( Brown , 1997a ) . The peak northward migration is during September and October ( Mate , 1973 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . Numbers decrease during the winter , but increase again with a smaller peak in April/May during the southward migration ( Brown , 1997a ; Brown18 ) . Sea lions are not restricted to coastal areas and have been seen as far up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls on the Willamette River ( Brown , 1997a ) . <p> In Washington the peak northward migration occurs in December , and the peak southward migration is in March/April ( NMFS , 1997a ) . Large aggregations occur in Puget Sound from September to May , but decline during January-March . Increased numbers around Vancouver Island , B.C. , in January corresponds with the decrease in Puget Sound and may be related to herring abundance . California sea lions are most abundant along the outer coast from March to May and from October to December and are absent , or in low numbers , from June to August ( Gearin et al. 19 ) . <p> California sea lion abundance increased dramatically during the latter half of the 1900 's after a period of extensive exploitation that began in the 1800 's ( Cass , 1985 ; Stewart et al. , 1993 ) . They were taken for pet food , hides , " trimmings , " display , sport , bounty , fishery protection , and even target practice ( Lowry et al. 14 ) . Commercial fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until prohibited to do so under the 1994 amendments to the MMPA ( Cass , 1985 ; 16 U.S.C. 1387(a) ( 5 ) ) . Sea lion numbers began increasing after curtailment of the commercial hunt in the 1940 's and markedly so after passage of the MMPA in 1972 . <p> The 1995 population estimate for the U.S. stock was 167 , 000-188 , 000 ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) , higher than the previous estimates of 111 , 016 in 1990 ( Lowry et al. 14 ) and 87 , 000 in 1988 ( Boveng20 ) . <p> Pup counts increased 8.8% per year between 1976 and 1982 , 10.2% per year from 1983 to 1991 , and at 8.3% per year for 1983-95 ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) ( Fig. 11 ) . El Nio events profoundly impact growth rates and survivorship through decreased prey availability for pregnant and lactating females ( DeLong et al. , 1991 ) ; major declines in pup counts occurred during the strong El Nio years of 1983 , 1992 ( see Fig. 11 ) , and 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1997 ; DeLong21 ) . Because of these pup declines , the average annual rate of increase in pup counts was 5.4% between 1975 and 1995 ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . <p> Peak Oregon counts grew from 1 , 000-2 , 000 in the late 1970 's to 5 , 000-7 , 000 in the early 1990 's ( NMFS , 1997a ) . An estimated 7 , 000-10 , 000 California sea lions likely pass through Oregon coastal waters during northward and southward migrations ( Brown , 1997a ) . Counts in the inland waters of Washington averaged 300-500 from 1986 to 1994 , then increased to over 1 , 100 in 1995 . Approximately 200-500 California sea lions were present along Washington 's outer coast during most of the 1990 's ( NMFS , 1997a ) . Numbers have increased substantially since 1997 , with high counts of approximately 980 , 1 , 200 , and over 2 , 700 in 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 , respectively ( Gearin22 ) . Fishery-related Mortality <p> California sea lion incidental mortality is highest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California set gillnet fishery for halibut and angel shark , with mean annual takes of 49 and 815 , respectively , for 1991-95 . Other commercial fisheries with known incidental mortalities are the California , Oregon , and Washington Pacific salmon troll fishery , Oregon and Washington nonsalmon troll fisheries , California herring purse seine fishery , California anchovy , mackerel , and tuna purse seine fisheries , California squid purse seine fishery , Washington , Oregon , California , and British Columbia salmon net pen fishery and the Washington , Oregon , and California groundfish trawl fishery ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ; Beeson and Hanan23 ) . Information on the mean annual takes is unavailable for many of these fisheries and is relatively low for the others . The total estimated minimum annual take for all fisheries combined was 915 for 1991-95 ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . Food Habits and Prey <p> Diet varies by location , year , and season . The most commonly consumed prey at the Channel Islands were market squid , northern anchovy , Pacific whiting , shortbelly rockfish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific sardine ( NMFS , 1997a ; Lowry and Caretta , 1999 ) . <p> Market squid , present in 35-44% of scats from three Channel Islands rookeries ( 1981-95 ) , is one of the most important prey items for sea lions in that area ( Lowry and Carretta , 1999 ) . Its prevalence in the diet increases in fall and winter , except during El Nio years when squid abundance declines ( Lowry et al. , 1991 ; Lowry and Caretta , 1999 ) . Most Pacific whiting consumed were 1-2 years old ( Antonelis , 1996 ) . The abundance of northern anchovy , which was available year-round and at a high frequency of occurrence in the diet , was inversely related to the consumption of other prey at San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands ( 1981-86 ) ( Lowry et al. , 1990 ; Lowry et al. , 1991 ) . <p> In central California offshore waters , Pacific whiting , rockfish , market squid , and herring dominate the diet . At the Farrallon Islands , Pacific whiting was most prevalent from April to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions primarily consumed 2-3 year old whiting , the availability of which was inversely related to diet diversity . Rockfish were a major component of the winter diet ( Ainley et al. , 1982 ; Bailey and Ainley , 1982 ) . Principal prey at Ao Nuevo Island were Pacific whiting , shortbelly rockfish , and market squid ( NMFS , 1997a ) . Market squid dominate the California sea lion summer diet in Monterey Bay ( Harvey and Weise , 1997 ) . In San Francisco Bay , Pacific herring was most common in fall and winter ( NMFS , 1997a ) , and peak sea lion numbers around Tomales Bay coincided with winter herring spawning ( Huber , 1991 ) . <p> In coastal Oregon , the most common prey were Pacific mackerel , Pacific whiting , Pacific herring , cephalopods , Pacific sardines , salmonids , smelts ( Osmeridae ) , spiny dogfish , lamprey , rockfish , jack mackerel , skates , and sand lance ( NMFS , 1997a ; Riemer and Brown24 ) . Pacific mackerel was most abundant in February and Pacific whiting most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Puget Sound , Wash. , important prey included Pacific whiting , Pacific herring , squid , salmonids , spiny dogfish , and gadids ( Schmitt et al. , 1995 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . Diet data are not currently available for the Washington outer coast . Steller Sea Lion Distribution , Abundance , and Population Trends <p> Steller sea lions of the contiguous U.S. west coast are part of the eastern stock which ranges from east of Cape Suckling , Alaska , through southeast Alaska , British Columbia , and along the west coast to California ( Loughlin , 1997 ) . Only the California , Oregon , and Washington components will be discussed . The southern extent of the breeding range is currently in central California on Ao Nuevo Island ( Stewart et al. , 1993 ; LeBeouf et al. 25 ) . Other rookeries include the Farallon Islands , Sugarloaf/Cape Mendocino , and St. George Reef ( off Crescent City ) in California and Rogue Reef , Orford Reef , and Three Arch Rocks in Oregon ( Loughlin et al. , 1984 ; Loughlin et al. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 10 regular haulout sites in Oregon , including the above-mentioned rookeries , from the south jetty at the Columbia River south to Rogue Reef ( Brown18 ; Brown and Riemer26 ) . Principal haulout sites in Washington range along the outer coast , and include Tatoosh Island , Cape Alava , Carroll Island , and Split/Willoughby Rocks ( NMFS27 ) . Steller sea lions are not commonly found in coastal bays or rivers , except the lower Rogue River and , occasionally , the lower Columbia River in Oregon ; they tend to remain within 5 miles of shore on offshore islands , reefs , and ledges ( Brown , 1997a ; Brown28 ) . <p> Since the early 1900 's the southern extent of the breeding range has shifted northward . In the late 1930 's there were over 2,000 Steller sea lions on the Channel Islands . By 1958 , there were less than 100 on San Miguel Island , the historical southernmost breeding site ( Bartholomew , 1967 ) . No pups have been born there since 1981 , and no adults have been seen there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current southernmost rookery , Steller sea lions were no longer present year-round beginning in the 1980 's ( LeBeouf et al. 25 ) . There has been no pupping at Point Reyes Peninsula since the mid 1970 's ( Sydeman and Alien , 1999 ) and little pupping at the Farallones since the early 1970 's ( Hastings and Sydeman29 ) . <p> The breeding season is from late May to early July ; peak pupping is in June ( Gentry , 1970 ) . Males generally disperse northward after breeding ( Mate , 1973 ; Hastings and Sydeman29 ) ; Mate ( 1973 ) found no adult males south of Oregon after August . Peak abundance in California and Oregon is during the breeding season . Because there are no rookeries in Washington , abundance there is lowest during the breeding season and highest from late-summer through winter ( NMFS , 1997a ; Gearin22 ) . <p> Steller sea lions were reportedly abundant along the California coast and outer islands prior to being hunted during the late 1800 's and into the 1900 's . Although California and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea lions taken by hunting were undoubtedly Steller sea lions ( Cass , 1985 ) . Large numbers were killed for bounties along the Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia coasts ( Stewart et al. , 1993 ) . Prior to 1971 , most subadult and adult mortality was from gunshot wounds . Rookeries in Oregon were dynamited and sea lions shot because of assumed fisheries interactions ( Brown18 ) . The frequency of such events declined after being declared a nongame species in 1971 and gaining protection through the MMPA in 1972 ( Mate , 1973 ) . <p> Steller sea lion populations did not escalate after passage of the MMPA . While counts in northern California and Oregon have been relatively stable to increasing , those in southern and central California have been declining ( Westlake et al. , 1997 ; Sydeman and Allen , 1999 ; LeBeouf et al. 25 ; NMFS27 ; Hastings and Sydeman29 ) . Counts of nonpups in California diminished from 5 , 000-7 , 000 between 1927 and 1947 to 1 , 500-2 , 000 since 1980 ( NMFS27 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; NMFS30 ) , and on Ao Nuevo , the largest central California rookery , they decreased nearly 10% per year from 1990 to 1993 ( Westlake et al. , 1997 ) . The Oregon population averaged about 2 , 000-3 , 000 since the 1970 's , and nonpup counts increased from roughly 1 , 500 in 1976 to over 3 , 000 20 years later ( Brown and Riemer26 ; Brown28 ; NMFS30 ) . This may reflect both improved and expanded surveys and an actual increase ( Brown and Riemer26 ) . An estimated 550-600 pups are born annually in Oregon , mostly at Rogue and Orford Reefs and a few at Three Arch Rocks ( Loughlin et al. , 1992 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . <p> Range-wide surveys of the eastern and western stocks were conducted during the summer breeding seasons of 1989 and 1994 ( Loughlin et al. , 1992 ; NMFS30 ) and a coast-wide census was made in summer 1996 . The 1994 nonpup counts included 1 , 046 in California , 3 , 070 in Oregon , and 447 in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were excluded in 1994 , and Washington was not surveyed in 1989 ( Loughlin et al. , 1992 ; NMFS30 ) , precluding a comprehensive assessment of trends . The total count for the 1996 census was 6 , 555 ( 5,464non-pups , 1 , 091 pups ) and included California ( 2,042 ) , Oregon ( 3,990 ) , and Washington ( 523 ) ( Gearin22 ; Brown28 ; Sydeman31 ; Ferryman32 ) . Figure 13 shows combined nonpup counts for California and Oregon trend sites only . The 1996 Washington coast summer count was comparable to counts during 1956-60 ( Loughlin et al. , 1984 ) , 1958-70 ( Mate33 ) , and 1994 ( NMFS30 ) . Nonbreeding season counts in Washington are substantially higher at 1 , 000-1 , 300 Steller sea lions ( Gearin22 ) . The eastern stock of Steller sea lions is listed as threatened under the ESA and depleted under the MMPA . Stock status relative to OSP is unknown ( Hill and DeMaster , 1999 ) . Fishery-related Mortality <p> Mortality incidental to west coast commercial fisheries was very low during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishery was less than two Steller sea lions per year , and less than one in the swordfish gillnet fishery , the Pacific whiting component of the **28;474;TOOLONG groundfish trawl fishery , and the northern Washington marine set gillnet fishery , respectively ( Hill and DeMaster , 1999 ) . Food Habits and Prey <p> Preliminary analysis of Steller sea lion prey in Oregon ( 1986-96 ) included 27 families and 36 species ( Riemer and Brown24 ; Gearin and Brown34 ) . Prey identified in =10% of scat samples for all years combined included , by percent frequency of occurrence , Pacific whiting ( 83% ) , Pacific lamprey ( 39% ) , salmonids ( 23% ) , Pacific herring ( 19% ) , squid/octopus ( 18% ) , skates ( 16% ) , and smelts ( 10% ) ( Riemer and Brown24 ) . <p> Pacific whiting ranked highest for all years , except 1986 and 1987 , when it was second to Pacific lamprey ( Riemer and Brown24 ) . Prey consumed at the Columbia and Rogue Rivers included Pacific whiting , rockfish , eulachon , anchovy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NMFS , 1997a ) . Scats collected in Washington during June-September 1993-97 included prey remains from 22 families and 25 species ( Gearin and Brown34 ) . Frequencies of occurrence for the seven major prey items , all sites combined , were Pacific whiting ( 94% ) , Pacific herring ( 23% ) , spiny dogfish ( 19% ) , skates ( 12% ) , Pacific sand lance ( 10% ) , Salmonidae ( 10% ) , and Pacific mackerel ( 4% ) ( Gearin22 ) . Harbor Seals <p> Eastern North Pacific harbor seals range from Baja California to the Aleutian Islands and from the Bering Sea to Cape Newenham and the Pribilof Islands ( Barlow et al. , 1998 ) . There are several stocks within this range . The three along the contiguous U.S. west coast have been designated by NMFS , using combined biological and management considerations , as the California stock , the Oregon and Washington coast stock , and the Washington inland waters stock ( Boveng35 ) . <p> Harbor seals frequent coastal and estuarine waters and haulout on a variety of substrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1996 ; Barlow et al. , 1998 ) . They are essentially nonmigratory and exhibit strong site fidelity ( Herder , 1986 ; Barlow et al. , 1998 ) . Movements are usually within 25-50 km , but may be up to 550 km ( Brown and Mate , 1983 ; Herder , 1986 ) , and occur primarily outside of the pupping season ( Huber , 1995 ) . Harbor seals are year-round residents of Washington , Oregon , and California and pup in all three states ( NMFS , 1997a ) . There is a cline in the timing of pupping , occurring earlier in the south and later in the north . Pupping in Washington exhibits additional area-specific variability ( Temte et al. , 1991 ; Jeffries et al. 36 ) . <p> California Stock : Distribution , Abundance , and Population Trends The California harbor seal population has been steadily increasing , and its distribution has expanded since the 1960 's . The number of occupied haulout sites in California increased from 427 in 1982 to 877 in 1995 ( Hanan , 1996 ; NMFS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast , the Channel Islands , Ao Nuevo Island , and the Farallon Islands ( Hanan , 1996 ) . They were uncommon on the Channel Islands during the 1950 's , but now breed on all eight islands ( Stewart et al. , 1993 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . Mean pupping dates are from late March to mid-May ( Temte et al. , 1991 ) . <p> Harbor seals were hunted for bounty in California during the early 1900 's , received state protection from hunting in 1938 , and Federal protection under the MMPA in 1972 ( Hanan , 1996 ) . Surveys occurred as early as 1927 , but they were infrequent until the 1960 's and not systematic until the late 1970 's ( Hanan , 1996 ) . Statewide counts are currently derived from aerial surveys during the premolt period from late June to early July ( Hanan , 1996 ) or from May to June ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . The most recent statewide count was 23 , 302 in 1995 ( Hanan , 1996 ) ( Fig. 14 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1995 ( Hanan , 1996 ) . The average annual statewide growth rate was 3.5% from 1982 to 1995 , but was 1.9% , 5.8% , and 3.1% for the southern , central , and northern parts of the state , respectively ( Hanan , 1996 ) . The rate of increase on the South Farrallon Islands was 15.9% per year from 1973 to 1985 , then averaged 9% per year from 1985 to 1997 . This high rate of increase was attributed to immigration rather increased pupping ( Sydeman and Alien , 1999 ) . The status of the California stock of harbor seals relative to OSP is uncertain , although the population is increasing and fishing mortality is decreasing ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . Fishery-related Mortality <p> The set gillnet fisheries for angel shark , halibut , and other large mesh fisheries accounted for nearly all incidental mortality of harbor seals in California . The mean annual take during 1994-95 was 228 seals . Implementation of gillnet area closures in southern California in 1994 reduced fishing effort and incidental mortality from a previous high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . The California Department of Fish and Game ( CDFG ) implemented similar restrictions along the central and north coasts ( Hanan , 1996 ; Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . Oregon and Washington Coast Stock : Distribution , Abundance , and Population Trends <p> Most harbor seal data describe the populations by state rather than by stock . The following is differentiated by stock , when possible , and by state , when necessary . General Oregon and Washington information precedes the more specific regional and stock information . <p> In Washington harbor seals are found on the outer Olympic coast , in the coastal estuaries of Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay , the Strait of Juan de Fuca , San Juan Islands , south Puget Sound , and Hood Canal ( Huber , 1995 ; Jeffries and Johnson37 ) . In Oregon , they occur in most coastal estuaries , embayments , along isolated shorelines , offshore rocks and ledges , and at least 150 miles up the Columbia River ( Brown , 1997a ; Jeffries et al. 36 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oregon ( Huber , 1995 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . Pupping and breeding occur at all of these sites . Peak pupping in Oregon is from mid-May to mid-June ( Brown38 ) . Pupping in Washington occurs in early June in the coastal estuaries , around mid-June along the outer coast , from August to September in the inland waters , and from August to January , usually with a peak in mid-September , in the Hood Canal area ( Jeffries and Johnson37 ; Huber , 1995 ) . <p> Prior to the 1940 's , about 5 , 000-6 , 000 harbor seals were estimated to be in Washington waters ( Newby , 1973 ) . An estimated 17 , 133 seals were killed in Washington between 1943 and 1960 through a bounty hunt to control apparent competition with commercial fisheries ( Newby , 1973 ; Johnson and Jeffries39 ) . About 3 , 800 seals were similarly killed in Oregon between 1925 and 1972 ( Barlow et al. , 1998 ) . <p> The Oregon and Washington coast stock increased nearly three-fold between 1977 and 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count in 1992 , but the annual rate of increase slowed substantially during the latter part of this period ( Barlow et al. , 1998 ) . The average annual rate of increase in Oregon was only 0.3% during 1988-96 ( Brown38 ) . The combined annual rate of increase for the Washington coast and inland waters was 7.7% for 1978-93 but was less than 3% for 1991-93 ( Huber , 1995 ) ( Fig. 16 ) . The Oregon and Washington coast stock of harbor seals may be nearing OSP ( Barlow et al. , 1998 ) . Fishery-related Mortality <p> Incidental mortality has been reported in the northern Washington marine set gillnet fishery ( 5.6/year ) , the **28;504;TOOLONG Pacific whiting groundfish trawl fishery ( 0.2/year ) , Grays Harbor salmon drift gillnet fishery ( 6.77 year ) , the Willapa Bay drift gillnet fishery ( =3.5/year ) , and the Washington-Oregon salmon net pen fishery ( =0.5/ year ) . The Washington-Oregon lower Columbia River drift gillnet fishery averaged 213 harbor seals per year for 1991-92 , but was only open 3 days in 1994 and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Inland Waters Stock : Distribution , Abundance , and Population Trends <p> The Washington inland waters stock includes Hood Canal , Puget Sound , the San Juan Islands , and the Strait of Juan de Fuca . General distribution , pupping , and historical trends are noted above . The 1996 count was nearly double the 1984 count of 6 , 062 ( Boveng35 ; Barlow et al. , 1998 ) . Unlike the coastal stock , this population is continuing to increase ( Huber , 1995 ; Barlow et al. , 1998 ) , perhaps due to emigration from British Columbia ( Huber , 1995 ) . Tagging data indicate that harbor seals readily move between the San Juan Islands and the Gulf Islands and Boundary Bay in British Columbia , but not between the coast and the inland waters ( Huber , 1995 ) . The stock status relative to OSP is presently unknown ( Barlow et al. , 1998 ) . Fishery-related Mortality <p> The minimum total estimated fishery-related mortality is 36 seals per year based on observer data and strandings . Fisheries with reported takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Puget Sound nontreaty chum salmon gillnet fishery ( 107 year ) , and the Puget Sound treaty and nontreaty sockeye salmon gillnet fisheries ( 15/year ) ( Barlow et al , 1998 ) . Food Habits and Prey <p> At the Channel Islands and coastal waters of southern California , prey included octopus , plainfin midshipman , market squid , rockfishes , flatfish , Pacific whiting , and spotted cusk-eel ( NMFS , 1997a ) . In Monterey Bay , prey included octopus , market squid , Pacific whiting , spotted cusk-eel , rockfish , plainfin midshipman , white croaker , Pacific sanddab , and staghorn sculpin ( Harvey and Weise 1997 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . Yellowfin goby dominated in San Francisco Bay , followed by plainfin midshipman , northern anchovy , and staghorn sculpin ( Torok , 1994 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . The anchovies were primarily juveniles consumed during the pupping season ( Torok , 1994 ) . <p> Prey consumed in Oregon was equally diverse . In the Columbia River , the diet consisted primarily of 15 taxa ( Browne et al. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herring , starry flounder , and other flatfish , smelts , lamprey , juvenile salmonids , Pacific tomcod , American shad , surfperch ( Embiotocidae ) , northern anchovy , and Pacific whiting ( Riemer and Brown24 ; Browne et al. 40 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . <p> Highest seal counts in the river coincided with winter spawning aggregations of eulachon , which was present in 85-100% of winter scats ( NMFS , 1997a ) . Coastal prey included sand lance , several species of sole , staghorn sculpin , Pacific whiting , smelts , lamprey , cephalopods , Pacific herring , surfperch , sanddab , rockfish , flatfish , eulachon , and salmonids ( NMFS , 1997a ; Riemer and Brown24 ) . Pacific lamprey , cephalopods , rex sole , Pacific herring , rockfishes , Pacific tomcod , and salmonids made up less than 10% frequency of occurrence for all sites in Oregon combined , 1983-96 ( Riemer and Brown24 ) . <p> Prey consumed in Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay , Washington included northern anchovy , smelts , Pacific whiting , flatfish , sculpins , salmonids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NMFS , 1997a ) . Prey in the inland waters included Pacific whiting ( Puget Sound stock ) , Pacific tomcod , plainfin midshipman , Pacific herring , market squid , shiner perch , sculpins , walleye pollock , sole , and sand lance ( NMFS , 1997a ) . In the nearby Strait of Georgia , Pacific whiting ( Strait of Georgia stock ) and Pacific herring constituted 75% of biomass consumed by harbor seals ( Olesiuk , 1993 ) . West Coast Fisheries Pacific Whiting <p> The four major spawning stocks of Pacific whiting ( also known as Pacific hake ) are the coastal stock , the Puget Sound stock , the Strait of Georgia stock , and a stock off the west coast of southern Baja California ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . The coastal stock is the most abundant and widely distributed , is genetically distinct , and characterized by a larger body size and extensive seasonal migrations ( Stauffer , 1985 ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . It is also the most abundant groundfish resource of the California Current ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both predator and prey ( Fiscus , 1979 ; Livingston and Bailey , 1985 ) . Only the coastal stock is discussed here . <p> The coastal stock is highly migratory and typically ranges from southern California to Queen Charlotte Sound , B.C. ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . It is a transboundary stock with biomass and landings in both U.S. and Canadian waters . From April to October , Pacific whiting migrate onshore and north along the continental shelf and slope from northern California to northern Vancouver Island , B.C. ( Dorn , 1995 ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . The densest summer feeding aggregations occur over depths of 200-300 m , and diurnal vertical migrations bring them near to the surface at night ( Alverson and Larkins , 1969 ; Dorn et al. , 1994 ) . The peak southward migration to the spawning areas is generally during November and December and spawning occurs from January to March ( Dorn , 1995 ) . Spawning concentrations are difficult to locate , but they range from central California to Baja California , over the continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1985 ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ; Bailey et al. 41 ) ( Fig. 17 ) . Pacific whiting remain between 200-500 m deep when spawning and do not migrate diurnally ( Alverson and Larkins , 1969 ; Bailey and Ainley , 1982 ; Ainley et al. , 1982 ) . <p> Migratory behavior is age-dependent , resulting in age stratification along the coast in summer . The mean migration distance increases with age ; older fish are more widely distributed than younger fish ( Dorn , 1995 ) , and there is a higher mean size-at-age farther north ( Methot and Dorn , 1995 ) . Juveniles ( 1-3 years old ) usually remain off central and southern California from spring through fall ( Ainley et al. , 1982 ; Bailey et al. 41 ) . Larger , older whiting typically arrive off Oregon and Washington by late April and off Vancouver Island by late May ; smaller fish arrive later ( Methot and Dorn , 1995 ) . A preponderance of older ( age 5+ ) , larger , and female whiting migrate into Canadian waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . In general , whiting smaller than 40 cm are in the southern areas and those larger than 40 cm are in the northern areas ( Wilson and Guttormsen , 1997 ) . However , range and biomass shift northward during El Nio events ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . <p> The coastal stock is characterized by extreme recruitment variability . Strong year classes can be two orders of magnitude greater than weak year classes ( Dorn , 1995 ) and dominate the population for 5-7 years ( Bailey and Francis , 1985 ) . This affects the mean age and spatial distribution of the population ( Dorn , 1995 ) . Recruitment to the exploitable stock is generally between ages 3-6 ( Stauffer , 1985 ) , with a significant contribution by age 3 ( Methot and Dorn , 1995 ) . Average weight and length of mature whiting are 1 kg and 52 cm , respectively ( Alverson and Larkins , 1969 ) . The Fishery <p> Large-scale harvests of Pacific whiting in U.S. waters began in 1966 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 's ( Dorn , 1995 ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . A U.S.-foreign joint venture ( JV ) fishery began in 1978 . Suspension of Soviet and Polish fishing privileges in 1980 and 1982 , respectively , resulted in a diminished foreign non JV fishery in 1982 and no directed foreign fishery in 1983 ( Nelson , 1985 ) . Non JV foreign fishing ended in 1989 . The fishery became fully domestic in 1991 with the end of the JV fishery ( Methot and Dorn , 1995 ) . <p> The domestic Pacific whiting fishery is a midwater trawl fishery comprised of at-sea processors ( motherships ) , catcher-processors ( factory trawlers ) , and a shore-based fishery ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . Seasons and quotas vary by sector . <p> The primary fishery occurs between April and November from northern California to British Columbia . Subject to spatial and temporal regulations , it essentially follows the whiting migration . Foreign and JV fisheries began off central Oregon in April , then worked northward through the summer and fall ( PFMC , 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon , and British Columbia ( Ainley et al. , 1982 ) . During 1972-76 , fishing effort shifted south to central California ; more juveniles were targeted as a result ( Ainley et al. , 1982 ) . Beginning in 1977 , the MFMCA prohibited fishing south of lat. 39N and within 12 nautical miles ( n.mi. ) of shore ( Ainley et al. , 1982 ; PFMC , 1997 ) because of chinook salmon by-catch , national security , and a high juvenile whiting catch ( Methot and Dorn , 1995 ) . U.S. catches are currently taken from Oregon to Cape Flattery , Wash. , over depths of 100-500 m ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . The Makah Indian Tribe , which entered the fishery in 1997 , fishes off Cape Flattery . The Canadian fishery is primarily south of lat. 49N , off of southwest Vancouver Island , B.C. ( Methot and Dorn , 1995 ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . <p> The at-sea fishery generally fills its quota in 2-3 weeks ( PFMC , 1997 ) . Season closures in 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August for most of the shore-based sector ( northern California closed in June ) ( PFMC , 1998a ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . The season closures differed in 1998 because of the shift in distribution associated with El Nio . The mothership fishery ended in May , factory trawling and the northern California shore-based fishing sector fishery closed in August , and Washington and Oregon shore-based fisheries closed in mid-October ( PFMC , 1998a , Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . <p> The U.S. catch averaged 152 , 053 t from 1966 to 1998 . Canadian landings averaged 51 , 044 t for the same time period . The combined catch averaged 203 , 097 t , from a low of 89 , 936 t ( 1980 ) to a high of 358 , 901 t ( 1994 ) ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) ( Fig. 18 ) . <p> Most of the Canadian catch ( 1985-95 ) was age 7 and greater , whereas the U.S. catch had a higher frequency of age 3 and 4 fish . The mean size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged from 40.6 cm to 44.7 cm . The smaller mean size in 1998 ( 40.6 cm ) may have been due to the El Nio induced northward shift of age 2 and 3 year classes that year ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . Stock Status <p> Biomass increased substantially in the early 1980 's , peaking at 5.7 million t in 1987 , then decreased as the 1980 and 1984 year classes were replaced ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) ( Table 5 ) . Average biomass from 1972 to 1998 was 2.8 million t , and was 1.67 million t in 1998 ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) ( Fig. 18 ) . A continued decline in biomass is expected over the next 3 years ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . <p> The coastal stock is fully exploited relative to the acceptable biological catch ( ABC ) , harvest guidelines ( HG ) , and quotas ( Low , 1993 ; Methot and Dorn , 1995 ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . U.S. catches were below HG prior to 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Canada harvested below their quota prior to 1987 but have fully utilized it since ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . The combined U.S. and Canadian quotas have exceeded the annual ABC since domestication of the fisheries , averaging 128% of ABC from 1991 to 1992 and 112% from 1993 to 1998 ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . <p> The exploitation rate also increased recently . United States exploitation averaged 6.5% from 1972 to 1998 , with a high of 13.9% in 1998 . The 1972-98 Canadian average was 2.0% and was also highest in 1998 at 5.2% . The combined exploitation rate was generally below 10% through 1993 but has averaged roughly 17% since 1994 ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) ( Fig. 18 ) . Management <p> Stock assessment and management are conducted jointly by the U.S. and Canada . Joint assessment , however , is recent ( 1997 ) and management is not always smooth . The Pacific whiting fishery is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council ( PFMC ) and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans ( DFO ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-standing disagreement exists over Canadian and U.S. allocations of the annual ABC ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . The respective quotas , relative to ABC , were basically compatible from 1985 to 1990 . The United States accounted for 58-80% and Canada 28-37% of the total ( Methot and Dorn , 1995 ) . In 1991 and 1992 , the U.S. and Canadian quotas were 90% and 30% of ABC , respectively . The U.S. quota has been 80% since 1993 ( Methot and Dorn , 1995 ; PFMC , 1998a ; Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . The ABC has been set at 290 , 000 t since 1997 and allotted as described above , for U.S. and Canadian quotas of 232 , 000 t and 80 , 000 t , respectively . The 25 , 000 t quota given to the Makah tribe in 1997 and 1998 was part of the total U.S. quota ( Dorn et al. , 1999 ) . <p> Prior to 1997 , 60% of the U.S. quota was available on a competitive basis to all vessels , with the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PFMC , 1997 ) . Since 1997 , 34% is allocated to factory trawlers , 24% to motherships , and 42% to the shore-based plants ( PMFC , 1997 ; PFMC , 1998a ) . The Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative ( PWCC ) , established in 1997 , further allocates shares of the factory trawler quota among member catcher-processor companies ( PFMC , 1998a ; Dora et al. , 1999 ) . Market Squid <p> Market squid is an important prey resource throughout its range . Nineteen species of fish , 13 avian species , and 7 marine mammal species reportedly consume market squid in Monterey Bay ( Morejohn et al. , 1978 ) . Market squid range from central Baja California , Mexico to southeast Alaska , but are most abundant between Punta Eugenio , Baja Calif. , Mex. , and Monterey Bay , Calif . ( Dickerson and Leos , 1992 ; PFMC , 1998b ; Vojkovich , 1998 ) . They are considered pelagic and are primarily found over the continental shelf , from the surface down to 800 m ( PFMC , 1998b ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast is unknown , as is the portion of the stock residing in U.S. waters ( PFMC , 1998b ) . <p> This is a small squid , with adults reaching 305 mm and 56-84 g ( Vojkovich , 1998 ) . The maximum age is 2 years and most spawn when 1 year old ( Spratt , 1979 ; Jackson , 1998 ) , but maturity and longevity may occur at earlier ages ( Butler et al. , 1999 ) . The natural mortality rate is nearly 100% per year after spawning ( Spratt , 1979 ; Jackson , 1998 ) . Basic life history and fisheries biology information , such as productivity , growth , and maturity are largely unknown ( PFMC , 1998b ) . <p> Market squid form dense aggregations when spawning and prefer shallow , protected nearshore waters ( Fields , 1965 ; Vojkovich , 1998 ) . Total spawning area is unknown , but the greatest spawning concentrations are off central and southern California ( Fields , 1965 ; Vojkovich , 1998 ) . Spawning occurs year-round , with peaks in southern California from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December in central California ( primarily Monterey Bay ) ( Fields , 1965 ; Spratt , 1979 ; Vojkovich , 1998 ) . Spawning may peak biannually ( Spratt , 1979 ; Leos , 1998 ; Butler et al. , 1999 ) . Spawning has been observed off Oregon and Washington from May to July and off British Columbia in late summer ( PFMC , 1998b ) . The Fishery <p> Fishing occurs on the spawning grounds during the spawning season . Therefore , peak catches are in the fall and winter ( October to March ) in southern California , during the late spring and summer ( April to November ) in central California , and during the late summer from Oregon to Alaska ( CDFG , 1998 ; PFMC , 1998b ; Butler et al. , 1999 ) . The California fishery lands most of the catch ; landings elsewhere are quite small ( Fig. 19 , 20 ) . Landings in Washington increase during or just after warm water El Nio events ( Schoener and Fluharty , 1985 ) . <p> Chinese immigrants started fishing for market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets for canned and frozen squid were developed in the 1920 's , and the fishery steadily increased during WW II and the 1950 's , as it expanded into southern California ( PFMC , 1998b ; Vojkovich , 1998 ) . Most of the catch was from central California , especially Monterey Bay , until the early 1950 's . From the 1960 's to the 1980 's , landings were split between central and southern California . The southern California fishery , which concentrates around the Channel Islands ( PFMC , 1998b ) , increased since the late 1980 's and currently accounts for 90% of the landings ( CDFG , 1998 ; Vojkovich , 1998 ) . <p> The market squid fishery was relatively minor until the 1980 's , yet recently became California 's largest fishery in tons landed and value . The central California take averaged about 6,000 t since 1950 . The southern California landings increased from an average of 9,000 t in the 1970 's and early 1980 's to over 41,000 t during the 1990 's ( Vojkovich , 1998 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70,000 t per year ( PacFIN42 ) ( Fig. 19 ) . <p> Landings plummeted during the 1997-98 El Nio ( Fig. 19 ) , as the squid were either unavailable or harder to catch ( PFMC , 1998b ; CDFG , 1999 ) . The 1997 fishery was not as heavily impacted as the 1998 fishery ( PacFIN42 ) . <p> The growing importance of the fishery in California resulted in an expansion in area fished ( Dickerson and Leos , 1992 ) and in the number of participating vessels . The number of vessels fishing for market squid increased from 85 in the 1970 's and 1980 's to 149 in 1997 ( CDFG , 1998 ; Vojkovich , 1998 ) . Fishing effort is expanding into previously underutilized spawning habitat off southern California ( Vojkovich , 1998 ) . The commercial squid fishery predominantly uses round-haul ( purse seine ) nets , although some scoop nets are used off southern California ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Stock Status <p> No information is available on the stock size of market squid . Because of the high rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dependent on spawning success and survival of recruits ( Spratt , 1979 ; PFMC , 1998b ) . The resource was considered underutilized for several decades , although that may be changing as the fishery expands ( Vojkovich , 1998 ) . Management <p> The California market squid fishery has essentially been an unregulated , open fishery , with a few small area closures in California off Santa Catalina Island and weekend closures in Monterey Bay . All vessel operators have needed to fish for squid were a commercial fishing license and boat registration ( CDFG , 1998 ; Vojkovich , 1998 ) . In 1997 , the California Senate passed a bill that included an expansion of the Monterey Bay weekend closure , a requirement for a squid permit for squid vessels and all light vessels ( those that use lights in catching squid ) , and a moratorium on new permits . Funds generated by the permit fees were to be used by CDFG to conduct squid research . The Squid Research Scientific Committee and Squid Fishery Advisory Committee were established and CDFG was given management authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1998b ) . <p> Market squid is included in the PFMC 's new Coastal Pelagic Species Fisheries Management Plan ( CPS FMP ) . Because of the paucity of basic information on market squid , the current preferred option is monitored management . The ABC recommended for the stock was 25% of the Maximum Sustainable Yield ( MSY ) catch , but MSY catch is unknown . The California Senate bill , noted above , required that CDFG develop management options based on the findings of the funded research by the year 2001 ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Northern Anchovy <p> Northern anchovy are preyed upon during all life stages . Juveniles and adults are important forage for a variety of fish , bird , and marine mammal species ( PFMC , 1998b ) . They range from Magdalena Bay , Baja Calif. , to the Queen Charlotte Islands , B.C. ( Frey , 1971 ) . The population is divided into northern ( Monterey Bay , Calif. , to B.C. ) , central ( San Francisco to Punta Baja , Baja Calif. ) and southern ( entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1998b ) . Most of the central subpopulation is within the Southern California Bight ( between Point Conception , Calif. , and Point Descanso , Mex . ) ( PFMC , 1998b ) . It supported a significant commercial fishery and has been the most extensively studied . The southern subpopulation will not be discussed . <p> Northern anchovy are small and short-lived , rarely surpassing 18 cm and 4 years of age ( Frey , 1971 ; PFMC , 1998b ) . Age composition and size vary regionally , with older and larger fish farther north and offshore ( Parrish et al. , 1989 ) . This distribution pattern is exaggerated during warmwater periods , such as El Nios , and at high abundance levels ( Methot , 1989 ; PFMC , 1998b ) . Anchovies commonly school in near surface ( <50 m ) and nearshore waters ; juvenile anchovy densities are about ten times higher nearshore than elsewhere ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Although spawning occurs year-round , it increases in late winter and early spring and peaks from February to April for the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ; spawning at an earlier age depends on water temperature ( Frey , 1971 ; Methot , 1989 ) . <p> Most of the northern subpopulation is offshore . Anchovies are only common along the Washington coast and coastal estuaries of Grays Harbor , Willapa Bay , and in the mouth of the Columbia River from May to October ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) . They also occur in Puget Sound , where they were once reportedly abundant ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . Spawning occurs from mid-June to mid-August , but specific spawning locations are not well known . A major spawning center off Washington and Oregon is associated with the Columbia River plume and anchovy eggs have been found in Puget Sound ( Richardson , 1981 ; Bargmann , 1998 ) . The Fishery <p> The anchovy fishery on the central subpopulation was small-scale until the mid 1940 's when the decline of Pacific sardines shifted focus to anchovies ( Frey , 1971 ) . Anchovies were initially landed for canning , and fluctuations in landings reflected changing consumer demand for canned anchovies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and livestock and pet food began in 1965 . Landings for reduction hit record high levels in the mid 1970 's , declined in the late 1970 's and early 1980 's , and have remained low since 1983 ( Thomson , 1990 ; Jacobson and Thomson , 1993 ) . <p> Anchovy harvests for live bait began just prior to WW II , and those landings have ranged from 3,500 t to 7,000 t per year ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Landings for use as dead bait , canned , fresh , or frozen products , and anchovy paste ranged from 250 t to 5,800 t from 1965 to 1997 ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Total landings in California grew from less than 5,000 t in the early 1960 's to over 140,000 t in 1975 , decreased to around 50,000 t per year in the late 1970 's , and to only a few thousand metric tons per year since 1983 . Landings in 1998 were 1,438 t ( PFMC , 1998b ; PacFIN42 ) ( Fig. 21 ) . This fluctuation is partly a response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NMFS , 1996 ) . <p> The fishery operates year-round , from 1 July to 30 June of the following year ( Jacobson et al. 43 ) . Round haul purse seines are primarily used . The age group targeted depends on the fishery . The live bait fishery probably targets younger fish than the reduction fishery , although both fisheries take large numbers of age 0-1 fish ( PFMC , 1998b ) . <p> The anchovy fishery is the most active coastal forage fish fishery in Washington . Landings fluctuate , but are generally relatively low ; 103 t were landed in 1998 ( Fig. 22 ) . Fluctuations are related more to demand than to biomass availability ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ; Bargmann , 1998 ) . Landings in Oregon are negligible . Stock Status <p> Total biomass for age 1+ fish for the central subpopulation averaged 326,000 t until the early 1970 's , increased to nearly 1.6 million t in 1974 , then declined to about 500,000 t in 1978 . Levels fluctuated through the 1980 's , declined during the early 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998b ) ( Fig. 21 ) . Spawning stock biomass ( SSB ) increased to an estimated 388,000 t in 1995 , apparently because of high recruitment in 1993 ( Jacobson et al. 43 ) . The stock was last assessed in 1995 , but 1997 biomass levels were assumed to be similar ( Jacobson et al. 44 ) . The decline in total biomass was blamed on low recruitment , rather than on harvesting ; fishing mortality rates rarely surpassed 17% ( Jacobson et al. 43 ) . Environmental fluctuations appear to influence variability in anchovy abundance ( Lluch-Belda et al. , 1989 ) . The central subpopulation was considered fully exploited during the early 1990 's ( Low , 1993 ; NMFS , 1996 ) , but is presently underutilized ( NMFS , 1999a ) . <p> The status of the northern subpopulation is unknown for there have been no recent estimates . This stock apparently has declined since the 1980 's ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . Stock assessments are not currently conducted for Washington coastal anchovies ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Management <p> Prior to 1977 , the northern anchovy ( central subpopulation ) fishery was managed by the CDFG . In 1978 , the PFMC assumed management with the adoption of the Northern Anchovy FMP ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Between 1966 and 1989 , reduction fishery quotas ranged from 68,000 t to over 370,000 t ( 1981 ) ; most years averaged closer to 100,000 t . From 1991 to 1994 , that quota was zero ( Jacobson et al. 43 ) . There is no quota for the live bait fishery and a 7,000 t quota for other non-reduction uses ( PFMC , 1998b ) . <p> California state waters are divided at Point Buchon into southern and northern permit areas for regulating anchovy fishing . The northern permit area is open to fishing from 1 August to 30 June and the southern permit area is open from 15 September to 30 June ; each includes small area closures . The allowable take is 5,000 t if there is no biomass estimate . <p> Management of the northern subpopulation in Washington is achieved primarily by compiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active management of the fishery ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) . In Oregon , anchovy fishing permits and gear restrictions are determined annually ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Pacific Herring <p> The range of Pacific herring extends from California to Alaska , and includes many spawning stocks ( Frey , 1971 ) . Herring is managed by individual states , usually on a stock-by-stock basis , and stock delineation is frequently spawning-ground specific . <p> Herring are relatively small and extremely important forage fish for marine mammals , sea birds , and other fishes throughout their range . They attain sexual maturity and enter the spawning population between ages 2 and 4 ( Spratt , 1981 ) . Adults are capable of spawning for several years and tend to return annually to their natal spawning areas . Herring spawn in shallow subtidal zones , with most egg deposition from 0 to minus 10 feet in tidal range ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . <p> Nineteen spawning areas , or stocks , are located in Washington , 18 of which are east of Cape Flattery and 1 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound are considered resident , while those that summer off the coasts of Washington and British Columbia are considered migratory ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . Spawning in Washington is from late January to early June and lasts two months . Spawning dates rarely vary by more than 7 days from year to year ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ; Bargmann , 1998 ) . Yaquina Bay is the primary spawning area in Oregon ( Bodenmiller45 ) . Spawning aggregations occur there from mid-January to late April , with peaks in February and March ( Brown18 ) . <p> The four largest spawning areas in California are in San Francisco Bay , the Tomales - Bodega Bay area , Humboldt Bay , and Crescent City Harbor . San Francisco Bay supports the largest spawning population , from which 90% of the state 's catch originates ( NMFS , 1999a ) . The spawning season in California extends from November to March ( Beeson and Hanan23 ) . The Fishery <p> Herring has been an important fishery resource in Washington for over a century . Several fisheries have existed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sac-roe , spawn-on-kelp , and recreational ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . Landings peaked at about 3,300 t in 1970 , then declined rapidly thereafter ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . Commercial sport bait and roe fisheries are currently the two principal fisheries in Washington ; there are no commercial herring harvests along Washington 's outer coast ( Lembergetal. , 1997 ; Bargmann , 1998 ) . <p> The commercial sport bait fishery targets juvenile ( ages 1-2 ) herring , mostly in south/central Puget Sound , during the spring through early fall when sport fishing is greatest ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ; Bargmann , 1998 ) . Landings were highest in the mid 1970 's at around 900 t/ year ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . Average landings from 1992 to 1996 were 464 t . Most take is with small ( <200 feet ) lampara seines ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) . <p> Adult herring fisheries target roe and are limited to north Puget Sound . <p> For the sac-roe fishery , spawning herring are caught and killed in gillnets or seines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t in 1974 , then declined with diminished stock size . <p> In Oregon , only Yaquina Bay has a large enough spawning stock to support a roe fishery , and takes are comparatively small . Average annual landings from 1981 to 1998 were 119 t ( PacFIN42 ; Bodenmiller45 ) ( Fig. 23 ) . The fishery generally opens in early February and takes are with lampara seines ( Brown18 ) . <p> The California herring fisheries , which peaked at over 10,000 t in 1982 ( NMFS , 1996 ) , are the largest on the west coast . Herring was initially harvested for reduction , bait , and canning , but the fishery for human consumption ended in 1954 . Since 1973 , California herring have been harvested primarily for roe for export to Japan ( NMFS , 1999a ) . The roe fishery season is November to March . California herring landings fell from 9,215 t in 1997 to little over 2,000 t in 1998 during the 1997-98 El Nio ( CDFG , 1999 ; PacFIN42 ) ( Fig. 24 ) . <p> The California roe-on-kelp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bays in 1965 , but it is currently limited to San Francisco Bay ( NMFS , 1996 ; CDFG , 1998 ) . The season is similar to that for roe , running from December through March for the 1998-99 season ( Ryan et al. 46 ) . Landings in Figure 25 do not include this fishery . <p> There is also a very small **25;534;TOOLONG fishery in Monterey Bay during the summer ( Spratt , 1981 ) . Only 45 pounds were landed in 1997 ( CDFG , 1998 ) . Stock Status <p> Spawn deposition and hydroacoustic surveys are used to assess herring biomass in both Washington and California ( O'Toole , 1995 ; NMFS , 1996 ; Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) . Stocks in Washington are assessed individually but will not be individually described . Cumulative spawning stock biomass ( SSB ) in south/central Puget Sound was fairly stable from 1977 to 1996 , averaging 5,514 t . The north sound SSB usually exceeded 9,100 t during 1977-80 , fluctuated through 1994 , then declined to roughly 5,500-6,500 t in 1995-96 . The Strait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined from the mid 1980 's to 1995 , then increased slightly in 1996 . Cumulative annual Puget Sound SSB for 1977 to 1999 averaged 14,069 t and has been below average since 1996 , despite a slight increase in 1999 ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ; Bargmann47 ) ( Fig. 25 ) . <p> As of 1996 , nine Puget Sound stocks were classified as healthy/moderately healthy , four were in a depressed or critical state , and information was insufficient for five . The Cherry Point stock , historically the largest in Washington , went from moderately healthy in 1994 to depressed by 1996 ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) . In June 1999 , NMFS received a petition to list several Puget Sound herring stocks as endangered , warranting initiation of a status review and inclusion on the list of candidate species for the List of Endangered and Threatened Species ( NMFS , 1999c ) . Status of the coastal stock is unknown , but sporadic survey coverage suggests an overall decline in SSB ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) . <p> In California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bays ; there are no estimates for Humboldt Bay or Crescent City ( NMFS , 1996 ; CDFG , 1998 ; Watters48 ) . The vast majority of the biomass is in San Francisco Bay , where 1978-98 SSB estimates ranged from 18,200 t ( 1997-98 ) to 90,636 t ( 1981-82 ) . The SSB estimates for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons were among the highest ever due to large 1992-94 year classes ( CDFG , 1998 ) . The smaller Tomales Bay stock ranged from 314 t ( 1989-90 ) to 10,046 t ( 1982-83 ) ( Watters48 ) . Combined SSB estimates for Tomales and San Francisco Bays ranged from 11,613 t ( 1973-74 ) to 97,142 t ( 1981-82 ) ( Fig. 24 ) . The precipitous decline in SSB in 1997-98 was likely a result of pronounced El Nio conditions . Preliminary 1998-99 spawning biomass estimates for San Francisco Bay were 35,945 t , primarily due to an influx of 2-year old fish from the large 1997 year class ( Oda and Watters49 ) . Management <p> Washington State herring are managed by the Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puget Sound Treaty Tribes . Harvest guidelines are based on stock biomass estimates ( Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) and are used to minimize adult takes in the juvenile fishery area ( south Puget Sound ) and juvenile takes in the adult fishery area ( north Puget Sound ) ( Wildermuth , 1995 ) . Quotas for north Puget Sound fisheries are determined preseason and divided 50:50 , treaty and nontreaty . The harvest rate is a sliding scale of 5-20% , depending on stock size ( O'Toole , 1995 ) . Harvest guidelines for north Puget Sound Cherry Point stock roe fishery and the spawn-on-kelp fishery have been around 6% since 1992 ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . The target harvest rate for the commercial sport bait fishery is 10% of the average estimated adult biomass in south Puget Sound , and has recently averaged about 7% ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . <p> Market demand for bait and some gear restrictions help maintain a take level below the calculated average yield of 819 t per year for Puget Sound ( Wildermuth , 1995 ) . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry ( O'Toole , 1995 ) . <p> Quotas for the Yaquina Bay fishery in Oregon are based on 20% of SSB . Abundance is predicted from one year to the next , although there are no good indices of abundance . There are no ocean harvest regulations ( Bodenmiller45 ) . <p> The CDFG manages each of the four major California spawning stocks separately ( NMFS , 1996 ) . Prior season estimates are used to determine catch quotas for the subsequent season . Allocation is usually 15% of estimated biomass , has been as low as 10% , but never above 20% ( Watters48 ) . Quotas for the 1996-97 roe fishery season included 11,181 t for San Francisco Bay , 215 t for Tomales Bay , 32 t for Humboldt Bay , and 25 t for Crescent City ( CDFG , 1998 ) . Pacific Sardine <p> Three subpopulations of Pacific sardine exist off the west coast of North America : the northern subpopulation ( northern Baja California to Alaska ) , southern subpopulation ( off Baja California ) , and a Gulf of California subpopulation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included here . <p> Pacific sardines have , periodically , been the most abundant fish of the California Current . When abundance is high , the range extends from the tip of Baja California to southeastern Alaska ( Parrish et al. , 1989 ) . When it is low , commercial quantities do not exist north of Point Conception , California . Occurrence in the northern part of the range is seasonal ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Increased biomass and warmer surface waters in recent years prompted the reoccupation of more northerly grounds off northern California , Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia ( Parrish et al. , 1989 ; Hargreaves et al. , 1994 ) . <p> Sardines are common in both nearshore and offshore areas and move seasonally along the coast . Older adults may migrate from southern California and Baja California spawning grounds to feeding grounds in the Pacific North-west . Younger adults ( age 2-4 ) feed along central and northern California . Juveniles are primarily in the nearshore waters of northern Baja and southern California ( PFMC , 1998b ) . <p> Sardines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Age at maturity changes with biomass levels . Maturity is common at age 1 at low biomass and at age 2+ at high biomass ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Spawning occurs in the upper 50 m of the water column and is influenced by water temperature . It peaks April through August between Point Conception , California and Magdalena Bay , Mexico . Spawning shifts northward and spans a longer time period during periods of warm water ( Lluch-Belda et al. , 1989 ) . The Fishery <p> The Pacific sardine fishery was the largest fishery in the Western Hemisphere during the 1930 's and 1940 's , with peak landings of over 700,000 t . Fish were harvested from Mexico to British Columbia , with 83-99% of the harvest taken in California ( PFMC , 1998b ) . The fishery began declining in the 1940 's . The range shifted southward with reduced abundance , and the fishery ended first in the Pacific Northwest ( 1947-48 ) , then northern California ( 1952-53 ) , but continued in southern California through the 1950 's ( Frey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . California imposed a 2-year moratorium on directed fishing in 1967 and allowed for a 15% take by weight in mixed loads for use as dead bait . Dead bait usage was limited to 227 t in 1969 . In 1974 , California enacted a complete moratorium on directed fishing but maintained incidental catch allowances for canning or reduction ( Wolf , 1992 ; PFMC , 1998b ) . <p> Rising levels of sardine bycatch in the southern California mackerel and live bait fisheries , and increased sardines in juvenile fish surveys in the 1980 's indicated increasing abundance ( Wolf , 1992 ) . The harvest moratorium was lifted in 1986 , reestablishing a directed purse seine fishery . There are currently 30 active purse seine vessels , known as the " wetfish fleet , " participating in the California sardine fishery ( Hill et al. 50 ) . Sardines are canned for overseas use , sold fresh , or used for live or dead bait ( PFMC 1998b ) . <p> Since the resumption of the California purse seine fishery in 1986 , landings have increased dramatically from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The fishery opens 1 January and operates year-round ; landings vary monthly due to fluctuations in availability , demand , and fleet participation . In 1997 , much of the catch was during the last quarter of the year when market squid was less available because of El Nio conditions ( CDFG , 1998 ) . <p> Landings in Ensenada , Mexico are also significant and increasing . Between 1983 and 1997 , Ensenada fishermen landed 63,700 t of sardines , 34% more than all California ports combined . Ensenada landings totaled 68,652 t in 1997 and 60,426 t in 1998 , compared to 42,839 t and 42,580 t in California ( PacFIN42 ; Hill et al. 50 ) . This resulted in total landings from this stock in excess of 100,000 t . Landings in Oregon were 3.9 t in 1992 , but have been under or near 1 t since then ( PacFIN42 ) . There are currently no sardine fisheries in Washington ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . Stock status <p> Sardine biomass typically varies over periods of about 60 years , with declines generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the absence of fishing , sardines are prone to fluctuations in biomass levels because of sensitivity to environmental variability ( Lluch-Belda et al. , 1989 ; PFMC , 1998b ) . Spawning stock biomass averaged 3.5 million t from 1932 to 1934 , was between 1.2 million t and 2.8 million t until the mid 1940 's , then sharply declined through 1965 . It was estimated as less than 5,000-10,000 t during the 1960 's and 1970 's . By the mid 1980 's , biomass began increasing at about 27% per year ( Barnes et al. , 1992 ; PFMC , 1998b ) . Age 1+ biomass escalated since 1983 and recently surpassed the 1 million metric ton criteria that defines population recovery . The estimated biomass for inside the range of fishery and survey data was 1.07 million t in 1998 ( Hill et al. 50 ) ( Fig. 26 ) . Biomass estimates include data from Mexico and the U.S. ( Barnes et al. , 1997 ) . <p> The stock 's range has been expanding along with the increasing biomass . The stock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has since extended northward ( Hill et al. 50 ) . The stock is reoccupying its historic geographic range ( Baja California to British Columbia ) and historic age groups are also currently represented ( Hargreaves et al. , 1994 ; Bentley et al. , 1996 ; Bargmann , 1998 ; Hill et al. 50 ) . Recent increases in the Mexican harvest may be sufficient to hinder sardine recovery even without a U.S. fishery ( PFMC , 1998b ) . With the combined harvests , the resource may well be fully utilized . Management <p> The CDFG currently manages sardines , with assistance and data from NMFS . Sardines are also included in PFMC 's Coastal Pelagic Species FMP as an actively managed species . Current regulations permit a fishery when spawning stock biomass exceeds 18,200 t ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Recent allocations include a 20% target harvest rate for the entire stock . In the absence of a cooperative management plan with Mexico , allocations are prorated by the percent biomass in U.S. and Mexican waters . As a result , 59% is allotted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The annual directed quota was 997 t from 1986 to 1990 , grew to 10,886 t in 1991 , and continued increasing thereafter to 43,545 t in 1998 and 120,848 t in 1999 ( PFMC , 1998b ; Hill et al. 50 ) . A dead bait quota of 227 t was established in 1988 and raised to 454 t in 1990 . The live bait quota was 68 t in 1984 and steadily increased to 907 t since 1988 ( PFMC , 1998b ) . The Coastal Pelagic Species ( CPS ) FMP includes a limited entry zone south of 39N within which vessels possessing limited entry permits may land no more than 125 t of CPS finfish per trip . Those lacking a permit may possess no more than 5 t ( NMFS , 1999b ) . The Coastal Pelagic Species FMP includes management options , such as harvest formulas and overfishing definitions , that incorporate forage needs and consider maintaining a forage reserve ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Discussion New England <p> Pinniped populations in New England are healthy and expanding . Resident species are increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending into the Gulf of Maine and southern New England . Food availability is apparently not a limiting factor . Prey studies , scanty for New England , suggest that harbor seals and gray seals consume a broad assortment of fish and squid , the selection of which is related to local abundance and availability and influenced by season , year , sex , and age class . Some prey species , such as Atlantic cod , silver hake , and Atlantic herring , are commercially valuable . There may be greater concern over the potential impact of expanding pinniped populations on commercial fisheries , rather than the reverse . The precarious state of New England groundfish resources could fuel this concern and exacerbate the issue . Incidences of operational interactions are well documented , especially in the New England sink gillnet fishery . The potential for prey overlap and resource competition may exist , but a detailed evaluation is not possible because of the complexity of these trophic interactions and a paucity of necessary prey data . <p> On average , only 3% of the New England sink gillnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams , 1999 ) . Both harbor seals and gray seals were observed feeding on herring inside and outside of purse seines off the coast of Maine . The seals were released unharmed , so no seal mortality was associated with the depredation ( Stevenson and Scully51 ) . <p> Williams ( 1999 ) found little overlap between the size of the target species in the New England sink gillnet fishery and the prey consumed by harbor seals caught in that fishery . They were principally feeding on prerecruits to the fisheries , so were not considered in direct competition for the targeted fish . This seemed particularly true for the Atlantic cod fishery . Most of the cod consumed by harbor seals were between 25-30 cm in length and those kept by the fishery were in the 60-70 cm range . However , these data were primarily derived from juvenile harbor seals , whose prey size selection may differ from that of adults . <p> Cod consumption by gray seals in the Gulf of Maine is unknown , but has been a critical issue in eastern Canada where cod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 ) estimated cod consumption by gray seals to be as high as 40,000 t in Atlantic Canada , a number derived by using estimates for the entire gray seal population . Over half of the cod consumed were less than 45 cm in length , or prerecruits to the commercial fishery . Similarly , Bowen et al . ( 1993 ) found that only 17% of cod consumed by gray seals in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were of commercial size . Gray seal predation of Atlantic cod on the Scotian Shelf was estimated to equal only 10-20% of fishing mortality and not considered an important factor in the cod stock collapse ( Mohn and Bowen , 1996 ) . The population of gray seals in the Gulf of Maine is comparatively small and localized in distribution . Any impacts on cod stocks are likely to be minimal . <p> Cod consistently appears in the diets of harbor seals in the Gulf of Maine and gray seals in eastern Canada , but its frequency of occurrence was never more than 26% ( Bowen et al. , 1993 ; Bowen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Williams , 1999 ) and the size consumed was smaller than commercially valuable size . Although not directly competing with the fishery , the seals ' removal of prerecruits could lead to a potential loss to the adult spawning population ( Beverton , 1985 ; Harwood , 1987 ; Hammill et al. , 1995 ) . <p> Silver hake consumed by pinnipeds and that targeted by the fishery were more similarly sized . Juvenile harbor seals consumed silver hake that ranged in size from 5-50 cm , with a mean length of 21.9 cm ( Williams , 1999 ) . The fishery primarily targets 25-35+ cm fish ; the new juvenile fishery targets fish that are generally less than 20 cm . A portion of the silver hake taken by harbor seals is also of the size class that is typically discarded ( 15-25 cm ) . Although this does not directly overlap with the primary fishery , it does with the juvenile fishery ; it could perpetuate the truncated age structure of the silver hake stocks . About 80% of the silver hake consumed by gray seals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1993 ) . <p> The potential for biological interaction may differ by stock of silver hake . Most information available regarding hake consumption comes from the smaller northern stock . Given the distribution of seals in the Gulf of Maine , this is probably the stock with which they would most frequently interact . Overholtz et al . ( 1991 ) estimated that harbor seals annually consumed an average of 449 t of silver hake from the northern stock and none from the southern stock between 1988 and 1992 . This was only a fraction ( 7.7% ) of the average annual fishery removal was 5,829 t in 1988-92 ( Heiser et al , 1995 ) , so may have had little impact on stock status . Proposed management measures that include coastal closure zones and take restrictions may minimize the likelihood for direct competition despite the current high level of fishery exploitation and the overexploited status of the northern stock of silver hake . Most landings are from the southern stock during the winter months and could overlap with harbor seals and gray seals wintering in southern New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seals caught in the New England sink gillnet fishery and was present in gray seal scats collected near Nantucket Island . The sample size for the latter was quite small ( present in 3 out of 42 scats ( Rough8 ) ) and the overall importance of silver hake in the diet was indiscernible . Also , the feeding rate of gray seals declines during the breeding and molting periods ( Reeves et al. , 1992 ; Bowen et al. , 1993 ; Rough8 ) , which would further reduce overlap . The impact of the expanding population of seals on the recovery of silver hake can not be ascertained . <p> Of the New England fisheries reviewed here , the Atlantic herring fishery has the greatest potential for biological interactions with pinnipeds . Assessing the extent of real or potential interactions is limited by the absence of prey information from the coast of Maine , where large numbers of harbor seals and a large herring fishery coexist . Most of the herring are landed off Maine between June and November when seals are abundant along the coast . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal movement of harbor seals in the Gulf of Maine . Herring is an important component of the summer diet in eastern Canada , where most of the herring consumed by both gray seals and harbor seals is of commercial size ( Bowen et al. , 1993 ; Bowen and Harrison , 1996 ) . The mean size of herring consumed by harbor seals caught in the New England sink gillnet fishery was 25.3 cm ( Williams , 1999 ) , also within the commercial size range . Overholtz et al . ( 1991 ) estimated that harbor seals in the northeastern United States annually consumed an average of 1,433 t of herring during 1988-92 . This was roughly 1.6% of the average annual landings for the total stock complex and 2.8% of the average annual Gulf of Maine landings . This consumption estimate was for years during which herring biomass was just beginning to escalate ; the current high levels of available biomass could alter that figure . <p> Herring is an important forage species for a number of predators , including seals and several commercially valuable fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The increase in the seal population in the northeast coincided with increasing herring biomass . This may minimize direct competition for declining groundfish resources , but could lead to indirect competition with groundfish through the common pursuit of herring as prey ( NEFMC , 1996 ; Williams , 1999 ) . <p> The NEFMC , concerned that a high rate of juvenile herring predation could affect recruitment to the fishery at age-2 , is taking a cautious approach to herring management and attempting to account for predator-prey interactions in the newly developed Atlantic Herring FMP . In developing the MSY and the target fishing mortality rates , there was an effort to account for non-fishery sources of mortality , including marine mammal predation ( NEFMC , 1999a ) . <p> The precautionary management approach and current high biomass levels may minimize the potential for biological interactions . However , the recent resurgence of the fishery , change in gear types used , shifting target size and location of fishing may result in as yet unforseen impacts and interactions . <p> Sand lances are important prey for pinnipeds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not detailed in this review because they are not commercially harvested in either the U.S. or Canada . Since there is no fishery for this resource , there is little possibility for direct biological interactions , an important consideration when evaluating pinniped prey availability . However , fluctuations in abundance of commercially exploited species that either prey upon or compete with sand lance could indirectly affect sand lance populations . Such was the case with herring . Herring and sand lance apparently exploit similar prey and fill similar niches trophically . When herring abundance declined in the 1970 's , the sand lance population increased significantly in shelf waters from the Gulf of Maine to Cape Hatteras ( Sherman et al. , 1981 ; Kenney et al. , 1996 ) . When the sand lance population around Cape Cod declined in the mid to late 1980 's , herring abundance increased and became a more important part of the harbor seal diet around Cape Cod ( Payne and Selzer , 1989 ) . West Coast <p> The potential for pinniped-fisheries interactions appears greater and more complex along the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the size of the region , the number of pinniped species , the extensive seasonal migrations undertaken by different sex and age classes of pinnipeds , tremendous variation in prey preferences , and numerous state and federally managed fisheries . Periodic El Nio events may further complicate matters by altering the abundance and distribution of prey and fisheries resources . <p> Pacific harbor seal and California sea lion populations have grown substantially since passage of the MMPA in 1972 , and some of the harbor seal stocks appear to be approaching carrying capacity . As opportunistic feeders , these pinnipeds exploit a large assemblage of prey , based on local abundance and availability , season , year , age or sex , and location . Fully 136 species or genera of fish , cephalopods , and crustaceans were identified as pinniped prey items in Washington , Oregon , and California ( NMFS , 1997a ) . Several , including Pacific whiting , market squid , northern anchovy , Pacific herring , and Pacific sardine , support commercially valuable fisheries with the potential for biological and operational interactions with pinnipeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. west coast have been well documented ( NMFS , 1997a ; Beeson and Hanan23 ) ; only those involving the commercial fisheries included in this review will be noted . California sea lions and harbor seals prey on the California herring gillnet fishery , with the frequency of depredation inversely related to fishing frequency . Both species also interact with the herring round haul ( purse seine and lampara net ) fishery and with the squid , sardine , and mackerel purse seine fisheries in California by foraging inside of the nets ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . <p> California sea lions usually escape from the herring nets before closure , so mortality is low ( Barlow et al. , 1997 ) . Depredation of the Yaquina Bay , Oreg. , herring fishery by California sea lions was considered problematic in the mid 1970 's . By the mid 1980 's , it was limited by a February opening date and was no longer considered a problem ( Brown18 ) . <p> The high abundance and extensive migrations of the coastal stock of Pacific whiting make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed by pinnipeds from the southern California rookeries to Cape Flattery , Wash . Availability is seasonal , size class differs regionally , and its abundance locally can strongly influence the predator 's diet ( Bailey and Ainley , 1982 ) . Smaller juvenile fish are generally consumed in southern California and larger , adult fish farther north . Availability of Pacific whiting is usually highest from spring through fall in California , and from summer through late fall in northern coastal regions . Its frequency of occurrence in the pinniped diet reflects seasonal changes in availability . <p> Pacific whiting is also the most commercially valuable and abundant groundfish resource of the California Current . As a result , it is one of the more thoroughly and regularly assessed of the U.S. west coast fisheries and has also been evaluated relative to its importance as pinniped forage . Bailey and Ainley ( 1982 ) and Livingston and Bailey ( 1985 ) estimated the total annual coast-wide pinniped consumption of coastal Pacific whiting to be 200,000-300,000 t , comparable to the commercial fishery 's annual landings . California sea lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated consumption highest south of 35N , based on population distribution ( Bailey and Ainley , 1982 ) . <p> Whiting is clearly an important component of the west coast pinniped diet , and seems particularly so for Steller sea lions in Oregon and Washington ( Gearin and Brown34 ; Riemer and Brown52 ) . Timing and location of the whiting fishery overlap with both Steller sea lion and California sea lion distribution along the northwest coast , and fishery closures south of 42N concentrate fishing efforts in this area . Lactating female Steller sea lions on the rookeries in Oregon focus foraging efforts on the dense offshore concentrations of Pacific whiting ( Riemer and Brown52 ) . Steller sea lions along the Washington coast , including several age and sex classes from rookeries to the north and to the south , consume a preponderance of Pacific whiting during the months it is available . There are currently no indications of resource competition for Pacific whiting along the Oregon and Washington outer coasts , but with fishing effort increasing near Cape Flattery , localized interactions could result . More detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyses of existing data are needed to better assess the likelihood of this occurring . <p> Since the coastal Pacific whiting fishery is , for the most part , closed south of lat. 42N , there are no apparent direct fishery impacts on California sea lions in southern and central California , including the Channel Islands rookeries , Steller sea lions in central California , and central and southern California harbor seals . In the few years preceding the fishery 's closure south of 39N in 1977 , intense whiting fishing in the continental slope waters off central California may have sufficiently depleted the resource near the Farallon Islands to cause California sea lions to feed inshore on other prey during late summer and fall . Sea lion distribution around the Farallones changed subsequent to the closure . The number of adults foraging offshore in the fall increased , as did the number of adults remaining at the Farallones during the summer , and juveniles moved farther north and farther offshore . This was attributed to whiting availability increasing offshore in the absence of fishing ( Ainley et al. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either their distribution , importance as prey , or fishery . Market squid is distributed coastwide , but is in greatest concentrations in southern and central California where it is a significant fishery resource and prey item . Its availability may be essential for female and juvenile California sea lions on the Channel Islands during the winter months , the primary spawning season for market squid in southern California . Both the fishery and pinnipeds exploit the dense schools of spawning adults around the Channel Islands during the winter , where its occurrence in sea lion scats mirrors the commercial harvest rate ( Lowry et al. , 1990 ) . Both also suffer the effects of market squid declines during El Nio years , resulting in the need to " prey switch . " The fishery may have greater short-term resilience and suffer fewer repercussions compared to the reproductive failures and high pup mortality experienced by California sea lions during strong El Nio events . Other prey consumed along with , or in place of , market squid need to be considered when evaluating the importance of market squid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its decline during El Nio events . The recent expansion of the fishery and relative lack of management heighten the potential for resource competition , but evaluating this is hindered by a dearth of information on market squid 's basic biological parameters , including stock size and status . Market squid are also consumed by pinnipeds in central California during the spring-summer spawning season , which coincides with the local fishery . Although only about 10% of the total California landings are currently from this area , localized interactions could still be significant . <p> Herring is an important forage fish for many of the pinnipeds discussed here , particularly for harbor seals in the northwest . With the Washington and Oregon harbor seal stocks increasing , impacts on prey and prey availability may arise . The Puget Sound herring stocks are commercially valuable and utilized by a growing population of harbor seals , whose estimated level of predation exceeds current fishing mortality ( Schmitt et al. , 1995 ; Lemberg et al. , 1997 ) . The herring fishery in Puget Sound is presently relatively small and the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of predation by seals in Puget Sound , some impact upon the stocks is possible , especially on a localized level , and for those stocks in a depressed - or endangered - state . The fishery and stocks are closely monitored and regulated and harvest rates are low . Although prey studies indicate that harbor seals consume herring in the Columbia River , Oregon coast , Grays Harbor , and Willapa Bay , insufficient information on those herrings stocks precludes evaluating predator-prey-fishery interactions . Fishing activity on these stocks of herring , however , is either negligible or nonexistent . <p> The larger herring stocks of central California , notably San Francisco Bay , are also utilized by pinnipeds . Pinniped predation is highest during the fall-winter spawning season , which coincides with the fishery . Interactions with the fishery are mentioned above . There do not appear to be any conflicts over prey availability , and both the herring spawning stock biomass and pinniped populations are at healthy levels . However , herring abundance decreases during El Nios , causing declines in landings , and could affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availability of northern anchovies and Pacific sardines appear important to the diet of pinniped populations along the coast , especially at the California sea lion rookeries , which are situated near large spawning aggregations of these small forage fish . The central subpopulation of anchovies was commonly exploited on the southern rookeries , where its predominance in the diet was year-round and less impacted by El Nios than some of the other forage species . The northern subpopulation was utilized by pinnipeds from central California and northward during the summer months . The anchovy fishery in southern California peaked in the mid 1970 's and has been fairly small since the early 1980 's . The most intensive fishing period then overlapped little with the period of greatest pinniped population increase in that area . Anchovy abundance recently declined , while Pacific sardine abundance is rapidly growing and expanding northward . <p> Sardines are important forage fish , with juveniles and adults preyed upon by numerous marine mammals , including seals and sea lions . However , there is little information available regarding sardines as prey because of their scarcity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forage species as abundance increases , perhaps replacing anchovies in the diet of some pinnipeds ( PFMC , 1998b ) . Since sardine is an important forage fish , management considerations include maintaining a forage reserve and incorporating forage requirements into harvest formula options and overfishing definitions ( PFMC , 1998b ) . <p> As an addendum , eulachon in the Columbia River deserve mention . The importance of eulachon in the winter diet of harbor seals is well documented , but the fishery is not reviewed here because of its small size and localized use of the resource . The highest counts of harbor seals in the Columbia River frequently coincide with winter spawning of eulachon ( Bargmann , 1998 ) . Eulachon are both commercially and recreationally harvested during the winter spawn and pinniped consumption was estimated as 26% of the commercial catch ( NMFS , 1997a ) . However , the eulachon population is declining and harvest levels dwindled to less than 5 t per year over the last few years ( Bargmann , 1998 ; PacFIN42 ) . Conclusions <p> Since passage of the MMPA in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contiguous U.S. west coast have grown exponentially , and the Oregon and Washington coast stock of harbor seals may even be approaching OSP . The U.S. west coast component of the eastern stock of Steller sea lions increased more gradually and less conspicuously . The population is relatively stable from at least northern California northward , but is declining from central California southward . The Steller sea lion is the only pinniped species included in this review that is listed as threatened , based on the status of the entire eastern stock . <p> The harbor seal , gray seal , California sea lion , and Steller sea lion populations described here exploit a broad assemblage of locally abundant and available fish and invertebrates , the relative significance of which is largely dictated by location , season , year , and environmental perturbations . Dietary differences are also related to age and sex class of the pinniped . All seem to maintain a degree of diet diversity and have the ability to " prey switch " in response to changes in prey availability and abundance . <p> A diverse diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1997 ; Williams , 1999 ) . Merrick et al . ( 1997 ) found a strong correlation between diet diversity and the Steller sea lion population decline in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands ; the decline was greatest where diversity was lowest . They concluded that a diverse diet - with at least two major prey resources - may enhance foraging efficiency and buffer fluctuations in availability of any one prey item . The California sea lion 's dietary and foraging strategy flexibility and adaptability are considered key elements in their recovery and continued population growth ( Lowry et al. , 1991 ; Melin et al. , 2000 ) . <p> The availability of small , schooling forage fish , alternative prey , and the ability to utilize that prey , are instrumental in adapting to fluctuating or limited prey resources . In both the New England and west coast regions , where most pinniped populations are thriving , small forage fish were nearly continuously available for exploitation . Fluctuations in abundance and availability , resulting from natural cycles and overexploitation , were frequently countered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , were apparently replaced by sand lance ( and vice versa ) when herring stocks collapsed in New England . Although both northern anchovy and Pacific sardine populations fluctuate widely , in approximately 60 year cycles ( Baumgartner et al. , 1992 ) , anchovy abundance was high during much of the recent period of low sardine abundance along the U.S. west coast . Similarly , the resurgence of herring following the collapse of the capelin stocks in the Barents Sea was instrumental in alleviating the effects of prey limitations on harp seals ( Haug and Nilssen , 1995 ) . Comparative analysis by Shima ( 1996 ) and Shima et al . ( 2000 ) concur . Available alternative prey , dietary flexibility , and large or expanding pinniped populations were common to the California Current , Benguela Current , and Barents Sea , whereas alternative prey was either unavailable or inaccessible in areas of the Gulf of Alaska where age-1 wall-eye pollock dominated the diet of the declining Steller sea lion population . Merrick ( 1997 ) considered the decline in abundance of forage fish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea . <p> Pinnipeds frequently prey upon commercially valuable fish and invertebrates , including Atlantic cod , silver hake , Atlantic herring , Pacific whiting , market squid , northern anchovy , Pacific herring , and Pacific sardine . Direct resource competition is then possible , as is competition for the prey of commercial species . This may be compounded by expanding pinniped populations , the sometimes vast fluctuations in commercial fish biomass , the fishery 's exploitation level , and the availability of alternative prey . <p> Given the current status of most pinniped populations described here , concerns over their impacts upon fisheries ( especially those with localized spawning stocks , or at critically low biomass levels ) are more prevalent than concerns over fisheries impacts on pinnipeds ( DeMaster and Sisson , 1992 ; NMFS , 1997a ) . Although pinniped predation is one component of natural mortality estimates ( M ) , few fish stock assessments explicitly address pinniped predation or the temporal-spatial elements of fishery competition . <p> Overlap in pinniped and fishery resource utilization exists in New England and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological interactions may be occurring can not presently be determined . More extensive and detailed research and evaluation are needed to augment the baseline information and trends presented here . Future endeavors would benefit from updated and more detailed prey information , including seasonality of prey preferences , and pinniped foraging depths and locations compared to specific times , locations , and depuis of fishery removals . Evaluating these variables on smaller geographic scales could reveal localized interactions that would otherwise be over-looked in broad scaled analyses . Reviewing management measures , particularly time/area closures , relative to pinniped movements and foraging locations may also prove instructive . <p> Potential biological interactions between pinnipeds and fisheries should be considered within a broader ecological context . This includes the impact of environmental changes on species composition and availability , especially when coupled with the effects of fishing ( Shima , 1996 ; Mueter and Norcross , 2000 ) , and accounting for predation by other species , fish and marine mammals included , when assessing fisheries and prey resources ( Hollowed et al , 2000 ; Shima et al. , 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management actions form a suite of interconnected variables that need to be considered when evaluating the causes and effects of biological interactions between pinnipeds and commercial fisheries .

@@4003941 INTRODUCTION <p> This study is intended to establish a framework for analyzing the economic impact of narcotraffic between Colombia , where most of the world 's cocaine is refined , and the State of Florida , which is the primary area of entry for Andean cocaine into the United States. 1 The purpose of the study is to analyze the economic costs and benefits of this activity to Florida , as an example that could be extended in both directions -- to Colombia and to the entire United States -- if additional data were to become available . Only the trade in cocaine is examined , though additional traffic in marijuana does take place and , in some cases , the data are not disaggregated for each drug . Only the economic impact is studied , though the trade obviously impacts the social and political realms as well . Because the tools of analysis are quite different among the disciplines , and because the economic issues need to be sorted out in any discussion of the overall impact of the cocaine trade , only economic issues are treated here . <p> While trade in illegal drugs in Florida encompasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade extends far beyond Colombia and Florida ( Bagley , 1988 ; Lee , 1985-86 ) , 2 the present study is limited to Colombia-Florida cocaine trafficking , distribution and consumption in Florida , and the financial flows involved . The conceptual framework illuminates the key factors involved in measuring costs and benefits to the state of Florida of the range of activities that constitute this drug trade . The key difference between Florida and other states , despite the fact that cocaine trafficking and consumption are national , not local , phenomena , is that cocaine typically enters the US market through Florida , and the flow of funds related to the wholesale trade often pass through Miami . This is in addition to the retail traffic that is similar across states in terms of the kinds of economic impacts involved . <p> The most common issues treated in impact studies of this type are the law enforcement costs and the drug treatment and rehabilitation costs due to illegal trafficking and drug consumption . Both of these are direct costs . In addition , the implicit social costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug abuse are usually estimated . The present project includes these issues and raises several additional concerns that apply especially to Florida . <p> Among the issues that are peculiar to the State of Florida is the process of international money laundering of cocaine-related income . During most of the 1980s , this phenomenon was centered in Miami , though in the past two or three years an increase in law-enforcement efforts have pushed money-launderers to seek additional points of entry into the United States , including other Florida cities such as Tampa and Orlando ( NNICC , 1989 : 91-99 ) . Money laundering can take place through many financial instruments and institutions , so the issue is much more complex than simply the process of depositing narcodollars in cash in Florida banks . Our interest is in the impact of this activity on Florida , but we need to trace it through the mechanisms used in order to understand the full significance . <p> Another issue that is clearly different in Florida from the narco-traffic picture in most of the rest of the United States is the investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This investment has taken the form of purchases of condominiums , apartments , and homes in ( principally South ) Florida , as well as acquisitions of companies , commercial real estate , and financial instruments in the area . Although it is not straightforward to estimate the amount of such investment in Florida , casual empiricism indicates that the quantity is quite large , and that it is concentrated in the Latin part of the state , mainly in Dade County. 3 As with the money laundering , these investments often are carried out through unusual vehicles , such as offshore trusts and non-resident companies . Investigation on this issue includes an effort to model the investment patterns and then to measure the value of such investments . Note that investments by local cocaine traffickers are not expected to differ across states , but that investment by the Colombian suppliers of the drug is known to concentrate in Florida . <p> A third issue that is specific to Florida is the consumption of goods and services by Colombian and Florida narcotraffickers , who use more of their funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they consume as well as invest in the local market . Consumption items include all goods and services , other than real estate and financial instruments , that may be purchased with available funds . Part of the effort here is to construct a plausible model of expected consumption by narcotraffickers . Then it will be possible to extrapolate the spending of this type , based on our initial estimates of the income produced . <p> An assessment of the economic impact of these activities , however accurately or inaccurately measured , requires comparison with alternative situations that could plausibly exist in the absence of the cocaine-related phenomena under study . Specifically , it is necessary to compare the costs of drug abuse now with what would occur in the absence of cocaine ( i.e. , assuming successful TOTAL INTERDICTION of the drug ) . This comparison would permit a discussion of the results of eliminating cocaine from consumption , which is the logical goal of the interdiction efforts . Also , it is useful to examine the alternative of LEGALIZING cocaine use in the United States , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the current costs and benefits of partial interdiction and continued illegal consumption . Each of these comparisons requires evidence from other contexts ( such as prohibition of the sale of alcoholic beverages and the subsequent abolishing of prohibition in the United States earlier in this century ) , since neither total interdiction nor legalization has been achieved . <p> The paper is divided into five major sections . First , the issue of crime protection/law enforcement is treated , presenting measures of the costs involved . In this section the costs of ( i.e. , damages due to ) criminal activities also are discussed . Second , the medical and rehabilitative costs are reviewed . Third , the question of lost employee production is raised and estimates suggested . These three sections use widely-available data and do not present any new evidence . The fourth section focuses on the financial flows involved in the narcotraffic , which lead to added investment and consumption in the Florida economy , as well as some added costs . This section presents a variety of methods for measuring the likely size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . All of the estimates refer to the year 1988 , unless otherwise noted . The fifth and final section compares these results with hypothesized outcomes under a situation of total interdiction of the cocaine trade and also under a situation of legalized cocaine trafficking . CRIME PROTECTION/LAW ENFORCEMENT <p> Protection against the crimes associated with drug trafficking is the largest direct cost found in this study . The crimes include such activities as : physically shipping cocaine into the United States from abroad ; transferring payments for the drugs into US financial institutions and other investments ; and robbery committed by cocaine addicts seeking money to buy more drugs . These activities alone suggest some of the key areas for protection expenditure : i.e. , government provision of ships , airplanes and people to interdict cocaine shipments ; the use of Operations Greenback , PolarCAP , C-Chase , and others to intervene in money laundering schemes ; operation of the legal system to prosecute violators ; and both police protection and personal security provision to deal with cocaine-related robberies . <p> Estimates of many of the costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem in 1984 . They can be ascribed proportionally to Florida based on the size of the state 's economy , to provide an initial crude estimate of the size of the problem . The estimates are as follows ( Harwood et . al , 1984 : 4 ) : See Table I below . <p> Without attempting to evaluate the accuracy of these data , it may simply be noted that the approximate crime protection cost related to cocaine trafficking in Florida was over $300 million in 1988 . From the perspective of the state of Florida , the Federal portion of enforcement expenditures is " subsidized by taxpayers in other states of the union since the Federal funds to pay for the programs are raised nationally . However , the Federal law enforcement expenditures related to cocaine interdiction actually are higher in Florida than in other states , so the estimate of these expenditures in the table is biased downward . More careful disaggregation of this information clearly is needed . <p> These numbers can be corroborated with direct measures of crime protection costs as compiled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enforcement has estimated a variety of costs incurred by state agency activities related to narcotics . The estimates cover a range of state and local government expenditures on crime protection programs , but not the Federal programs or private-sector expenses . These costs are listed in Table 2 for 1988 ( FDLE , 1989 ) . <p> An unavoidable problem with these estimates is that they cover costs of protection against crimes due to all forms of drug abuse , not just cocaine abuse . In fact , if we keep to the task of evaluating the costs and benefits of the cocaine traffic , these estimates will have to be lowered to exclude problems related to other drugs . The Florida Department of Law Enforcement specifically estimates that cocaine and marijuana account for about 45% of total crime cases investigated in the state . Of that 45% ( which is the basis of the estimates in the table above ) , the vast majority of cases ( about 80% ) relate to cocaine . This would give a final crime protection cost of $428 million x .80 -- $342 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the State of Florida costs of crime protection , we need to include the costs incurred by Federal agencies operating to control cocaine-related crime in Florida . The agencies involved include : Justice Department Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) and US Attorney 's Office ; Treasury Department Internal Revenue Service money-laundering unit ; US Customs Service ; US Coast Guard , and other agencies to a lesser degree . Estimates of the costs of operating these agencies in Florida and on Florida-related activities are shown in Table 3 . <p> An additional area of crime protection expense created by cocaine trafficking and consumption is personal protection obtained by households in the form of fences , burglar alarms , watchdogs , guards , etc . These costs have not been estimated in Florida , as far as we have been able to discover . Therefore , the national estimates that were interpolated for Florida are used again here : $91 million for 1988 . <p> The estimates are : $342 million for state and local law enforcement ; $87 million for Federal enforcement efforts ; and $91 million for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $520 million in 1988 appears to be a reasonable estimate of the total crime protection cost in Florida associated with cocaine-related crime protection . MEDICAL EXPENSES <p> Medical expenses related to the cocaine traffic are estimated mainly as the costs of rehabilitation programs provided by Federal and state authorities , as well as by private sources . Additionally , we would like to include the medical costs of those people injured in drug-related crimes , but measures of these costs were not available . <p> In the State of Florida , the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services ( HRS ) is responsible for managing and licensing all drug abuse services . HRS contracts with 86 community-based drug abuse programs throughout the state to provide comprehensive education , prevention , treatment and rehabilitation services . Additional educational efforts to reduce drug abuse are carried out by the Florida Department of Education in a variety of programs . <p> The medical expenses that were measured include : See Table 4 below . <p> As before , these are annual costs for programs and services in the State of Florida in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , the total annual cost for 1988 is $138 million . LOST PRODUCTION <p> This final issue on the cost side is the most difficult to measure . Obviously , an employee who is unable to work due to cocaine addiction or because the person participates in the illegal drug trade causes a loss of measured output for the economy . This simply assumes that that person would have been gainfully employed in the absence of the cocaine addition or business . However , the amount of work time lost to cocaine addiction is not possible to measure as accurately as the direct costs discussed above , since the level of addiction is not known , nor is the time lost from work readily attributable to cocaine abuse or other causes . Similarly , the narcotraffic participant may have otherwise worked in a productive job , or that person might have sought some other illegal employment or been unemployed . In all , the measures of lost work time must be fairly crude estimates of orders of magnitude . <p> After placing the above warnings about reliability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the national survey used in the previous estimates which , in turn , are restated as the Florida portion of the totals , lost production is by far the largest cost category of the drug trade . The 1988 estimates for Florida are as follows : See Table 5 below . <p> State estimates by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are very similar , showing about $5 billion of lost production in 1987 due to substance abuse in the state ( FDLE , 1988 : 2 ) . Finally , recent ( 1989 ) statements by the Federal drug policy coordinator , William Bennett , assert that in 1988 approximately $100 billion of productive output was lost due to narcotics consumption in the United States . This figure would impute to Florida , on the basis of population , about $4.7 billion of lost production in 1988 . Once again , adjusting the data to account for cocaine-related costs alone , the annual value of lost production for 1988 is $3.8 billion . <p> These numbers dwarf those for the other cost categories , so that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude is truly astounding. 13 The negative economic impact of cocaine traffic is clearly very significant in the three categories examined here . FUNDS INFLOW AND CONSEQUENT INVESTMENT AND CONSUMPTION <p> This final category of factors contributing to the total economic impact of cocaine traffic on the State of Florida is undoubtedly the most widely-discussed . It necessarily is also the least measurable since the money flows are often illegal and just as often disguised through various schemes to hide the ownership and source of the funds ( Walter , 1989 ) . <p> The transfer of funds is itself of relatively little interest when our concern is with economic impact . The direct result of even billions of dollars of new deposits in the banking system is minimal in terms of employment , spending , and other economic aggregates . ( For example , it has been estimated that at least $10 billion have moved from Panama to Miami banks since the indictment of General Noriega in 1988 . The net number of new jobs in the Miami banking sector appears to be on the order of 10 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore in the Euromarkets , little spending impact occurs in Florida. ) 14 As a result , our interest needs to focus on the uses of these funds , in investments and consumption of goods and services . <p> Before moving on to measure the uses of funds , it is necessary to establish some indication of the size of the flow of funds . These financial transfers may take a myriad of forms . Initial payments from US wholesalers of cocaine to Colombian exporters may be made completely within the United States , into accounts owned directly or indirectly by the exporters but , nonetheless , not crossing national borders and possibly not triggering government investigation into the source of the funds . Also , payments may be made in Colombia to the exporters and other participants in the early stages of drug production ; these people are likely to try to transfer the funds to a US location . This is the kind of situation in which " money laundering " is carried out , and which the US Treasury is combating specifically through operations of its money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine shipments , there are many downstream flows of money that result from the exporters ' use of their income to purchase US assets , products , and services . Purchase o luxury condominiums on Brickell Avenue in Miami or on Key Biscayne offer only the most visible use of these funds . Other uses range from the purchase of expensive cars , elaborate electronic security systems , and fast boats to the more mundane buying of household goods and airplane tickets . Figure 1 ( below ) sketches the kinds of money flows that arise from the narcotraffic between Colombia and Florida . <p> Note that extensive financial transactions are generated in both directions between the two countries . The resulting net balance of payments is highly likely to be positive for Colombia and negative for the United States . This is because the initial export of cocaine leads to income for Colombians , who subsequently spend only a portion of that on purchases from the United States , leaving some of the funds in Colombia . Since most of the funds will eventually be placed in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the overall balance of payments is probably minor . However , most of the merchandise exports are from Colombia to the United States , and most of the investments in dollar-denominated financial assets are owned by Colombians ( i.e. , capital exports by the United States ) . <p> In addition to the international flows involved , the total payments in Florida include sales by wholesalers to retail cocaine dealers in Florida and sales to final customers . While this part of the total income generated by cocaine traffic is not international , it unquestionably constitutes part of the income generated in Florida . Thus , after calculating the impact of income earned by Colombian cartels from their export sales , we will examine the income produced within the State of Florida by the downstream trafficking . Measuring Initial Funds Flows <p> The problem of measuring the initial funds flow to cocaine exporters is the critical difficulty in making some meaningful statement about the net benefit to Florida of the financial part of the narcotraffic . At this point in the study , our only reasonable statement about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working on the problem for several years . The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that in 1987 , in Florida , about $6 billion of illegal drug-related funds were paid to exporters and intermediaries ( El Nuevo Herald , 1988 ) . This estimate may or may not be accurate , but it must overstate part of the initial cocaine-export income since it includes marijuana as well as cocaine . If our intent is to measure first the initial income in the industry , then to see how the income is used , we must look for a better indicator of that initial flow . <p> One method for accomplishing this task would be to estimate foreign-owned deposits in Florida banks that come from Colombian depositors and then to estimate some percentage that could be judged to be cocaine-related . Although there are many difficulties with such a measure , it would offer one indirect indicator of the order of magnitude of the initial funds flow from Colombia . The greatest practical problem in creating the estimate is that Florida banks are not required to make available to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any other classification that would be useful here . It is possible to obtain for the foreign bank agencies in Florida , and for the Edge Act corporations in Florida , a direct measure of their non-resident deposits , subdivided into interbank deposits and deposits held by commercial and individual clients , but not by country of origin . For domestic , full-service banks in Florida , this disaggregation of accounts is not available . Based on the value of foreign-owned commercial and individual deposits , one could attribute a portion of the total as being from Colombia , and a portion of that as being cocaine-related . Each of these steps would obviously require crucial assumptions and some idea of the degree of approximation being used . <p> Since much of the drug-related funds are laundered before entering the Florida economy , even estimates of Colombian bank deposits in the state would greatly underestimate the actual inflows . As discovered by the Treasury Department 's money laundering unit , a wide variety of schemes are used to circumvent US law and avoid disclosure of the ownership and source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depositing funds in an offshore account before redepositing them in a Florida account can effectively hide the original source country and depositor . Thus it does not appear fruitful to try to estimate the economic impact on Florida via calculations of Colombian bank deposits there or via efforts to estimate the amount of money laundered before arriving in Florida . <p> Another effort to measure the initial funds flow can be made using data compiled by the Drug Enforcement Agency concerning the profits generated by stages in cocaine production and distribution . Figure 2 , from the Wall Street Journal ( 30 June 1986 ) , uses these data to present estimates of the profits per 300-kilogram shipment of cocaine that go to each participant in the " industry . " <p> These data indicate that about $15,000-per-kilo of cocaine go to the refiner -- but that $5,000-per-kilo go also to each pilot and wholesaler , and even more to distributors and dealers . These prices from 1986 must be reduced to reflect current ( 1988 ) market conditions , in which the value per kilo is about $12,000. 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that approximately 400 metric tons of cocaine were produced in South America in 1988 ( NNICC , 1989 : 39 ) . Subtracting from that an estimated 90 metric tons of cocaine interdicted by law enforcement efforts , we are left with 310 metric tons of cocaine that could have entered the US market in 1988 . Following this line of reasoning , income to the Colombian refiners can be approximated as 310 tons x $12,000 per kilo -- $3,720 million in 1988 . <p> The additional income earned by pilots and wholesalers ( who may be Colombian , US , or of some other nationality ) can be calculated as approximately 1/3 of that earned by the refiners , or $1.240 billion in 1988 . This calculation uses the Wall Street Journal estimate of distribution of profits in the narcotrade and the 1988 estimate of the price of one kilo of cocaine in Miami . Since approximately 70% of the cocaine imported into the United States is estimated to enter through Florida ( and the rest through California , Texas , and other states ) , we estimate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used in Florida . This leaves a Florida income of $868 million . <p> Finally , there is income generated at the level of drug dealers in Florida . Again working with the profit distribution as calculated in the Wall Street Journal study , and updating the price of cocaine to 1988 , we can arrive at an estimate of income earned by these participants in the drug trade . One additional piece of information needed at this stage is the amount of consumption of cocaine in Florida . Since we do not have such an estimate , some approximation is required . We can take total available production ( 310 metric tons ) and divide it into the proportion of the US population who reside in Florida to derive potential consumption within the state . In 1985 , Florida 's population was 4.7% of the US total ( University of Florida , 1987 : 4 ) . This leads to an estimate of possible consumption of 14.6 metric tons . At a 1988 street price of $30 per gram ( or $30,000 per kilo ) , the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $438 million . <p> In summary , the 1988 incomes obtained by each participant in the cocaine trade are estimated as shown in Table 6 . See below . <p> It is necessary to attribute some portion of this income to possible investment/depositing in Florida , such that we could begin to estimate the consequent economic impact . While no direct estimates are possible , it is possible to use an alternative sample of Colombian businesspeople to infer behavior of the cocaine refiners . In an annual survey of businesspeople in Call and Bogota in May of 1988 , the University of Miami found that the respondents would invest 73% of their available funds in Colombia and only 27% overseas ( IBBI , 1988 : 7 ) . This would mean a maximum of $1,004 million that would have been invested by the Colombian refiners in US deposits or investments . <p> Presumably the pilots , wholesalers , distributors , and dealers in Florida would initially put virtually all of their incomes into Florida deposits , or other holdings , and then spend ( or invest ) portions on local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full $1,678 million into available funds for investing and spending by these traffickers . Assessing the Full Investment/Spending Impact <p> Assuming that the initial level of income generated by the cocaine traffic between Colombia and Florida to the refiners is on the order of $3.7 billion per year during 1988 , probably 95% of it will enter the US financial system as dollar deposits at some time . As already estimated above , about $1 billion will be invested outside of Colombia , some of it in Florida . Spending by the recipients of this income will typically be some large fraction of the total income , on the order of 95% , with the rest saved in financial instruments and other investments. 17 This would produce $3,534 million of spending by the refiners , some of which would go to buy Florida products and services . If even one-fourth of the spending takes place in Florida , or on products and services produced in Florida , the largest direct impact of the refiners ' income will be about $884 million . <p> The pilots , wholesalers , distributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes similarly to others in this country , with about 95% going into consumption and the rest into savings . The $1,678 million of incomes would result in $1,594 million of initial spending , most of which would probably take place in Florida ( though not necessarily on products produced in Florida ) . <p> Thus total first-round spending in Florida , by all of the participants in the cocaine traffic , is estimated at about $2,478 million in 1988. 18 This value must be increased by the amount of capital investment created by the Colombian refiners ' use of their funds . We estimated that they probably invested about $1,004 million outside of Colombia in 1988 . Most of these funds would have been placed into financial investments , though some portion was surely invested in real estate , ongoing businesses , and other capital projects . Assuming that at most 25% of these funds were invested in capital investments , we add $251 million to the total economic impact on Florida of narcotraffickers spending and investment . The grand total is then estimated at approximately $2,729 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at about $2.7 billion , is far less than the costs incurred in Florida for law enforcement , medical expenses , drug rehabilitation programs , and lost employee production , estimated at about $4.5 billion for the year . Figure 3 presents summary data on the full economic impact . ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS <p> To draw useful conclusions from the above measures of economic costs and benefits of the cocaine trade in Florida , one needs relevant comparisons with alternative conditions that might exist . First , it is useful to explore the possibility that cocaine interdiction could be totally successful in eliminating the supply of the drug in Florida ( and presumably the United States ) . Second , it would be helpful also to explore the implications of legalizing the traffic in , and consumption of , cocaine , which is an occasionally-recommended alternative to the present strategy of partial interdiction . <p> The possibility of total interdiction of cocaine from the US market implies a successful law enforcement effort to stop the boats , airplanes , land vehicles ( through Mexico ) , and other means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Given that the existing law enforcement efforts have been successful in interdicting , at most , 90tons/400tons ( about 25% of total estimated production ) , the cost of total interdiction could not be less than about four times the current level . Of course , this estimate is wildly optimistic since cocaine traffickers could be expected to alter their strategies in response to greater law enforcement efforts -- to protect their billions of dollars of annual revenues . Given that , in previous instances , there has not been a single case of totally successful interdiction of other narcotics , it could even be argued that the cost of such a policy would be infinitely high . <p> Under a scenario of total interdiction , the costs of work lost due to cocaine consumption would be eliminated . This would result in huge savings if it occurred in isolation . If , however , cocaine consumption were replaced by consumption of other narcotics , such as heroin or the synthetic drugs that have been appearing in the 1970s and 1980s , the net benefit would be much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which other drugs were substituted for cocaine . The unhappy fact is that many cocaine users have also been identified as users of other drugs as well so that , in many cases , substitution is a strong possibility . <p> In the state of Florida , the net result from these conditions would be a large increase in expenditures on law enforcement , some of which would be subsidized by taxpayers in other states who pay part of the costs of the Federal agencies . Costs due to production lost and to rehabilitation would decline , perhaps significantly , depending on the degree to which other drugs were substituted for the interdicted cocaine . On the benefit side , if the Colombian cocaine cartels lost their ability to enter the US market , Florida would receive less spending and investment ( i.e. , fewer benefits ) than before , unless the substituted drugs led also to large revenues for traffickers in Florida . <p> The second alternative scenario that should be compared to the current situation is the possibility of legalizing cocaine traffic and consumption , possibly with restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large consumption tax , as in the case of alcoholic beverages . This policy would clearly eliminate most of the law enforcement problem ( except for crimes committed while under the influence of cocaine and , possibly , consumption by those underage ) . On the other hand , legalization would unquestionably increase the level of consumption due to the elimination of sanctions and , most likely , a decline in the price of cocaine . Although taxes could be used to keep the price high , those very taxes would encourage contraband sales of cocaine by people seeking to avoid paying them . <p> Any increase in consumption would increase the problem of lost production , presumably in proportion to the increase . This would be a major cost to the Florida economy , given the current annual cost of almost $4 billion in lost production when the drug is illegal . Savings of less than $1 billion in law enforcement costs ( even assuming that another illegal drug(s) does not substitute for cocaine and require continued law enforcement efforts ) would be overwhelmed by the work lost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In summary , there is no doubt that the net economic impact on the Florida economy of the cocaine traffic is quite negative . Even though the benefits of investments and consumption by cocaine traffickers in the state of Florida may be as much as $3 billion per year in the late 1980s , the costs of law enforcement , health services , and lost productivity are significantly greater . In 1988 , the costs in the state of Florida have been estimated here to be on the order of $4.5 billion . <p> Obviously , much more detailed analysis is needed to measure the full costs of lost work and productivity by cocaine consumers and traffickers . Equally obviously , the estimates of drug money flows are very crude . On both of these subjects , more study is needed . If the crude measures are at all in the range of actual costs and benefits , then our conclusions will hold even with the further details . <p> Another consideration to keep in mind when interpreting this analysis is the size of the activity relative to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income of the state of Florida was approximately $170 billion . This places the cocaine traffic at about 2% of income produced in the state during that year . In this context , the costs and benefits are relatively unimportant . On the other hand , the other problems -- psychological , social , and legal -- created by drug abuse may be far more important to the society than these economic considerations . <p> a " The author would like to express his appreciation to the University of Miami Colombian Studies Project , directed by Bruce Bagley , for its financial support of this study . <p> 
@@4017041 Section : Environmental Management Systems COMPOST MARKETING ISSUES The U.S. Composting Council has developed a White Paper discussing use of Canadian heavy metal standards for fertilizer products in the United States -- and the potential impact on compost registered as fertilizers . <p> IN 1997 , the issue of the lack of heavy metal standards for fertilizer products was spotlighted when a newspaper account in the Seattle Times reported that a fertilizer contained high levels of some contaminants not normally considered acceptable . The concern over the safety of inorganic fertilizers culminated in Washington state adopting Canadian standards developed for fertilizers . <p> The situation in Washington led a national organization , the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials ( AAPFCO ) , to address the lack of standards for heavy metals in inorganic fertilizer products . In February , 1998 , AAPFCO passed a motion to recommend adoption of the Canadian standards ( Table 1 ) . <p> To better understand the impact of these heavy metal standards on compost products , the U.S. Composting Council put together a White Paper ( from which this article is adapted ) on the origin and tentative recommendation for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the implications for composting and organics recycling activities . <p> In the United States , composters may register their compost products with a state department of agriculture either as a fertilizer or a soil amendment . The determining factors regarding how compost products are registered are based on the label claims a composter makes ( its marketing/sales strategy ) , and whether the state has enacted a Uniform Soil Amendment Bill , which enables a product to be registered as a soil amendment and thus claim those benefits ( e.g. improving the physical characteristics of soils ) on the bag or in sales literature . A compost that bears a nutrient claim is usually registered and regulated as a fertilizer . <p> " Manipulated " animal manures are considered to be fertilizers when marketed as such or if nutrient claims are made . Although AAPFCO defines manipulation as " processed or treated in any manner , including drying to a moisture content of less than 30 percent , " many states have not established a clear cut definition of the terms manipulated or manipulated manures . Manipulation also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. by various regulatory entities . If the Canadian standards are approved by AAPFCO and enacted by states , compost facility operators would be directly affected if their product is registered as a fertilizer ( like they already are in Washington state ) . AAPFCO INITIATIVES ON FERTILIZER REGULATIONS <p> AAPFCO is comprised of officials from the United States , Canada and Puerto Rico who regulate commercial fertilizers as well as other products such as soil amendments , agricultural liming materials and horticultural growing media . AAPFCO develops and updates model legislation that governs the labeling and distribution of these products so that interstate commerce is less affected . Once approved , model bills , terms and definitions , and Statements of Uniform Interpretation and Policy ( SUIP ) may be enacted by the regulating authority ; however , the regulating authorities are not required to enact AAPFCO model documents . For example , most states have enacted some version of AAPFCO 's Uniform State Fertilizer Bill , but only 37 states have enacted the Uniform Soil Amendment Bill . <p> AAPFCO 's Canadian standards initiative began with a recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt scientifically sound standards for the acceptable cumulative levels of substances not generally recognized as plant nutrients when applied to the soil . The By-Products and Recycled Materials Subcommittee of AAPFCO 's Environmental Affairs Committee then presented a recommendation to the Board of Directors to adopt the Canadian standards for fertilizers into a Metals in Fertilizer SUIP . A goal of this action is to discourage other states from adopting standards on their own ( as Washington did ) , threatening the uniformity in fertilizer regulation . <p> AAPFCO officials are authorized under the Uniform State Fertilizer Bill to stop the sale of an adulterated fertilizer product . Until the new SUIP is adopted , an adulterated fertilizer product is defined as one that " contains any deleterious or harmful substance in sufficient amounts to render it injurious to beneficial plant life , animals , humans , aquatic life , soil or water when applied in accordance with directions for use . " The definition in the AAPFCO Metals in Fertilizers SUIP is more specific . It reads : " As an interim guide for implementation of Section 12(a) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they contain metals in amounts greater than the levels established by the Canadian standards . Biosolids shall be adulterated when they exceed the levels of metals permitted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Code of Federal Regulations , Section 503 . Note : These interim guidelines are intended for use until scientific risk based standards are established by ongoing studies which are expected to be completed within two years . " <p> The ongoing studies referred to by AAPFCO include a risk assessment done in California on arsenic , lead and cadmium in fertilizers and a recently completed study by The Fertilizer Institute ( TFI ) that is evaluating the risk associated with applying fertilizer in commercial applications ( formally titled " Applicator Risk Assessment Study " ) . The Canadian standards are not based on an actual risk assessment ( as are EPA 's Part 503 regulations ) . Instead , they were developed by a group of scientists who based them on long-term cumulative metal additions to soils . <p> While the heavy metal limits are still in evaluation stage , AAPFCO has more clarity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The organization drafted an SUIP for Product Labels That Meet Metal Guidelines , which reads : " When applied as directed , this product meets the guidelines for metals adopted by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials . " Products that meet the Canadian standards for heavy metals in fertilizers will be required to include the above statement on their label , since all state officials have indicated they would accept this language on labels distributed in their state . UPCOMING VOTES ON ADOPTION <p> At the AAPFCO annual meeting in August , 1999 , members will vote on keeping the Metals in Fertilizer SUIP ( Canadian standards ) in tentative status for another year , and will vote to approve the SUIP for Product Labels That Meet Metal Guidelines as official . As noted , AAPFCO is still seeking additional scientific data ( risk based , peer reviewed ) to evaluate the risk from heavy metals in fertilizers distributed in the United States . Since these two SUIPs are in tentative status , any regulatory authority may adopt the SUIPs on an interim basis . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the political pressures in their state to do so are strong enough . <p> All chemical ( inorganic ) fertilizer products , both in bulk and bagged form , will be affected by these SUIPs , as will organic fertilizers , many animal manure products , and any other products registered and marketed as a fertilizer ( bearing nutrient claims on the label ) . The types of products affected in the United States will be dependent upon states ' fertilizer and soil amendment laws , as well as their interpretation of the laws and definitions within . The current SUIP for Metals in Fertilizers defines biosolids as adulterated only if the metal content is above those outlined in the US EPA Part 503 regulations . IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPOSTING INDUSTRY <p> Any state 's Department of Agriculture can adopt the Canadian standards for heavy metals in fertilizer , for use on an interim basis , as a means to define if a fertilizer product is adulterated . This would enable those states to order the stop sale of any adulterated products until they can meet the standards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all products marketed as fertilizers ( making nutrient claims ) , or defined as fertilizers by the Uniform State Fertilizer Bill or a particular state 's Department of Agriculture , will be affected by this SUIP . This would have an immediate effect on composts registered as fertilizers and many manure products ( those in the category of manipulated animal manures ) . These products will be required to meet both the new metal standards and the labeling requirements . Under current interpretation , biosolids products would not be affected , unless they are marketed and registered as fertilizers . Biosolids that are directly land applied ( especially where nutrient data is provided along with the product ) have not been addressed thus far . <p> Since the term manipulated manure is open for interpretation in many states , it will be difficult to determine how states will categorize composted manure ( even if they do not make nutrient claims as fertilizers ) . These labeling requirements could be extremely problematic if not standardized on a national basis . <p> Companies that want to register their compost with a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't instituted the Uniform Soil Amendment Bill , will have to register it as a fertilizer , thus subjecting themselves to the Metals In Fertilizers SUIP . ( Conversely , some composters want to register their products as a fertilizer , automatically subjecting it to the SUIP . ) In these instances , the adoption of the Canadian standards could be a deterrence to registering composts . Companies marketing manure products , and those making nutrient claims for their products , may choose to change the product name to something other than manure , or may choose not to make nutrient claims . Not providing this nutrient data is problematic to end users who rely on that information to determine supplemental fertilizer requirements . <p> Based on the fertilizer survey completed in Washington state , most fertilizer products likely will meet the Canadian standards , because they are applied at relatively low application rates , and the heavy metals standards are based on cumulative loading rates . Under current interpretation , yard trimmings , biosolids , food residuals , municipal solid waste , and other composts should not be affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered as fertilizers . If , however , they are registered as a fertilizer ( or make nutrient claims ) , composts may not be able to be applied at recommended application rates for maximum efficacy as a soil amendment . Manure-based products in Washington state that are registered as a fertilizer or that make nutrient claims are feeling the most impact from the new fertilizer law . For example , a typical fertilizer application rate may be only 0.5 to one ton/acre , whereas a compost application rate could be five to 100 tons/acre . <p> There are several questions that exist regarding future interpretations of the Metals in Fertilizer SUIP by individual states . For instance , how will the SUIP affect the land application of biosolids , since testing and reporting of biosolids for nutrients , as well as heavy metal content , is required ? Will certain states choose to adopt the Canadian standards for soil amendment products , as Canada has ? California already has created a Heavy Metals Facilitated Rule-Making Committee to evaluate the heavy metal standards for biosolids and other organic products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than fertilizers is very possible , and could be done on a state by state basis ( not uniformly ) . <p> In a nutshell , the bottom line for composters is this : If you make a nutrient claim or register your product as a fertilizer -- and sell the product in a state that has adopted the Metals In Fertilizer SUIP -- you need to comply with the heavy metals limits in the Canadian standards . WHAT ARE THE CANADIAN STANDARDS ? <p> THE Canadian standards for heavy metals in fertilizers were developed in 1979 in a trade document , and are enforced under the authority of the ( Canadian ) Fertilizers Act and Regulations , Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada ( AAFC ) . The metals standards are generally applicable to fertilizers and supplements applied to land or used in crop production . These standards have been used to evaluate and manage all products regulated under the ( Canadian ) Fertilizer Act and for which metal concerns have been raised ( e.g. , organic fertilizers , processed sewage , compost , phosphate rich fertilizers such as monoammonium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Between 1993 and 1995 , the AAFC met al standards were reevaluated in response to ( heavy metal ) standard development activities elsewhere ( e.g. , the U.S. EPA 's heavy metals limits for biosolids ) , the variety of by-products being proposed for reuse as fertilizers and supplements , and the progressive depletion of rock phosphate deposits worldwide . It was concluded that the AAFC metal standards remain valid . The Canadian standards for metals in fertilizers and supplements are based on what the Fertilizer Section , Plant Products Division of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency deemed as the total , acceptable , cumulative metal addition limits for soils . The Canadian standards affect all fertilizers and soil amendments , including compost and biosolids , marketed in Canada . FERTILIZER REGULATION EVOLUTION IN WASHIHGTOH STATE <p> CONCERN over the content of heavy metals in fertilizers appears to have begun in Quincy , Washington , when farmers blamed crop yield reductions and sick looking cows on the use of fertilizer products containing a steel mill by-product . This by-product was considered a hazardous waste at the steel mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) regulations , could be sold as a fertilizer ingredient . Eventually , the Washington State Department of Ecology ( DOE ) created a team to evaluate the issue of heavy metals ( nonnutritive elements ) in fertilizer products and the state legislature passed Senate Bill 6474 -- the Fertilizer Regulation Act -- giving DOE oversight authority over waste-derived fertilizers . <p> In June , 1998 , the state adopted the Canadian standards for maximum acceptable heavy metals additions to soils . The annual ( heavy metal ) limits were calculated by converting the kg/ha values into lbs/acre . Washington state assigned a long-term cumulative metals additions to soils of 45 years . The resulting limits , in annual maximum pounds/acre , are Arsenic -- .297 ; Cadmium -- .079 ; Cobalt -- .594 ; Mercury -- .019 ; Molybdenum -- .079 ; Nickel -- .713 ; Lead- 1.98 ; Selenium -- .055 ; Zinc -- 7.329 . The state Department of Agriculture may allow higher concentrations of certain micronutrients when guaranteed to provide needed nutrients to plants . The law also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk-based or peer-reviewed data become available which warrants their modification . <p> All fertilizerrs , agricultural liming materials , manipulated animal manure products , and any other products making nutrient claims fall under the purview of this law . ( Liming materials are considered fertilizer products in Washington state . ) Soil amendments currently are not regulated by the Department of Agriculture , and therefore do not fall under this law . However , if a compost product or any other soil amendment makes a nutrient claim or is registered as a fertilizer in Washington , then it has to comply . The language used on a product 's bag or label will determine whether it will be considered a fertilizer or a soil amendment . <p> The law also requires that all fertilizer products distributed in Washington , at a minimum , must have the following labeling statement : <p> " This product has been registered with the Washington State Department of Agriculture . When applied as directed , this fertilizer meets the Washington standards for arsenic , cadmium , cobalt , mercury , molybdenum , lead , nickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive specific information about Washington standards from the distributor of this product . " After July 1 , 1999 , the label also has to state that product content details are available via the Internet ( and the web site is provided ) . Two bills have been introduced in Washington state 's legislature suggesting modification of the labeling requirement . One supports the standard labeling language developed by AAPFCO ( see main article ) . <p> Finally , the state Department of Agriculture will begin Ecological Review of waste-derived and micronutrient fertilizers in July as part of their fertilizer registration process . AAPFCO RULE MAKING PROCESS <p> THE rule making process within AAPFCO usually begins with one of its committees evaluating an issue . If deemed to be relevant , especially over a multiple state area , and requiring action , the committee will develop a course of action , which could be in the form of a model bill , a revision to an existing bill or regulation , or Statements of Uniform Interpretation and Policy ( SUIP ) , and recommend it to the AAPFCO Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in February . The board will then either send the proposal back to committee for further review , or approve it , which begins a six month review process by the AAPFCO membership . <p> Next , the proposal would be voted upon by the membership at its annual meeting in August . If approved , the proposal receives tentative status , allowing interested states to enact it on an interim basis . At the following mid-year meeting , the sponsoring committee would recommend to the AAPFCO board to approve the proposal , or keep it in tentative status for further evaluation . If the committee recommends to the board that the proposal become official and the board approves the recommendation , then the proposal is voted upon by the membership at the annual meeting in August . If the membership votes for adoption , then the proposal is passed , and is recommended as an officially approved document by the association for adoption by all regulatory authorities . Table 1 .

@@4008041 In the last two decades , Mexico has emerged as one of the most important countries in the world from the point of view of U.S. foreign policy . For the first sixty years after the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920 , the United States took Mexican stability for granted , and we seldom worried overly about the large , populous , Third World neighbor on our southwestern border . Mexico was a top-down , authoritarian , patronage-based , single-party regime that incorporated major social groups into the political system ; this , coupled with an economy that expanded impressively for several decades , seemed to guarantee Mexico both political and economic stability-the primary goal of U.S. policy. ( n1 ) <p> But it was Mexico 's admission in 1982 that it could not pay its obligations that triggered the great Third World debt crisis of the 1980s . Shortly thereafter , the political system began to wobble as well , giving rise to the fear that Mexico would destabilize or that a left-wing , populist , anti-American regime might succeed the long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party in power . Suddenly it began to appear that the United States could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , destabilized , but still-distant Central American " banana republic , " but a populous ( 100 million ) , important country right on our border , whose destabilization would have immense implications for the United States both domestically and strategically . <p> Its potential for instability , either economic or political or both , has vaulted Mexico to a position of importance in U.S. foreign policy comparable to that of Japan , Germany , or Russia . It is not that Mexico represents a threat to the United States in any classic strategic or military sense . Mexico is not about to invade the United States militarily , nor are there Mexican missiles armed with nuclear , chemical , or biological weapons aimed at the United States . Instead , Mexico is important to us because of its ability to affect us domestically in many ways . Even the slightest hint of actual or potential economic or political instability in Mexico sends tens of thousands of Mexicans fleeing toward or across the U.S. border . And that has immense consequences for U.S. school systems , housing , employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs -- mainly in the Southwest , but now increasingly in other areas as well . It also triggers a domestic political backlash , resulting in pressures for increased border patrols , immigration restrictions , and insistence on English as the official U.S. language . These measures in turn trigger their own backlash in Mexico , which exacerbates the problem and increases the pressures on Mexican stability. ( n2 ) <p> Therefore , the best way to think about Mexico in an international relations sense is not through the lens of hardheaded , classic realism -- Mexico is not a military threat -- but through the newer prism of what Joseph Nye and Robert Keohane called " complex interdependence . " ( n3 ) Mexico is interdependent with the United States on a host of issues : oil and natural gas , tourism , trade , NAFTA , water rights , pollution and the environment , immigration and labor supplies , banking and investment , manufactured products , and now drugs , crime , gangs , and violence . There is perhaps no other country in the world , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such a wide range of issues . Note that most of these issues are not what we might call " hard " strategic threats , but rather what Nye and Keohane call " soft " interdependency issues . Note also that most of these are not what we think of as classic international relations issues over power and dominance ( although that is also involved ) ; rather , they are issues that are both international and domestic -- what we now call " intermestic . " Moreover , all of them are hot , post-cold war , front-burner issues . <p> That means that a host of U.S. agencies -- primarily domestic affairs agencies -- have jurisdiction over and are interested and involved in U.S. policy toward Mexico . Few of these traditionally domestic agencies -- EPA , FBI , DEA , and so forth -- have a long history of involvement in foreign affairs or in Mexico ; they frequently lack the language skills , international affairs experience , or foreign policy background to carry out their assigned roles successfully . Perhaps of even greater importance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jostling and even rivalries among agencies -- that has long characterized and often frustrated the successful carrying out of U.S. policy . We do not have a single U.S. foreign policy in Mexico ; instead we have approximately sixty-seven policies-one or several policies for each of the U.S. agencies operating there . It is the thesis of this article that the bureaucratic politics of U.S.-Mexican relations has now become so complex , so multilayered , so conflicting , that it hamstrings , frustrates , and often paralyzes policy and makes it virtually impossible for the United States to carry out a successful foreign policy there . BUREAUCRATIC POLITICS <p> In a justly famous book written some years ago about the Cuban Missile Crisis , Harvard scholar Graham Allison described the " rational actor model " of American foreign policymaking. ( n4 ) This model suggests that a series of options , with the pros and cons carefully weighed , are presented to the president or foreign policy decisionmaker , who makes the decision based on a " rational " calculation of which option best serves U.S. interests . Allison pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rational actor model , though that was how most Americans conceived of foreign policymaking -- when and if they thought about it at all . <p> But Allison argued that at least two other " models " were also present in foreign policy decisionmaking : an organizational model and a bureaucratic model . The organizational model indicates that foreign policy agencies have habits , guidelines , cultures , and standard operating procedures of their own quite independent of presidential decisionmaking ; in the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis , the Navy went ahead with its own way of blockading Soviet ships regardless of President Kennedy 's detailed instructions , even though the " Navy way " had the potential to trigger World War III . The bureaucratic model ( the main focus of our analysis here ) suggests that agencies such as the State Department , the Department of Defense , the Central Intelligence Agency , and others have independent bureaucratic interests ( budgets , power , prestige , access to the White House ) that they seek to enhance and protect , which are also quite independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted during the 1980s , for example , at the height of the cold war , State Department officials frequently lamented that dealing with the Soviets was easy compared with their discussions with a certain rival agency in a five-sided building in " foreign territory " across the Potomac. ( n5 ) <p> In the years after Allison 's book appeared , the models were refined , adapted , and expanded . Critics suggested that the organizational and bureaucratic models operated in circumstances when the foreign policy debate was long and protracted , but that in crisis situations where quick decisions were necessary ( such as the Dominican Republic intervention of 1965 ) , the president acted expeditiously without these other models coming into play . Then , on the basis of his experiences in the White House , Roger Hilsman refined Allison 's model , added new cases to it , and explored the role of additional groups and interests not included in Allison 's scheme. ( n6 ) In my own contribution to this approach based on my involvement in policymaking in the 1980s , I analyzed both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt issue ; Justice -- drugs and immigration ; Commerce -- trade policy ; Environmental Protection Agency-pollution ) and added two other models to Allison 's original three : a political process model , based largely on Congress 's increasing role in constructing foreign policy and the log-rolling involved in that process ; and a personal aggrandizement model , based on the rise of the self-interested " me generation " and on the data generated by political scientists , who demonstrate that if all other variables hold constant -- party , state , region , district , gender , rural-urban , and so on -- the factor that most explains congressional voting and political decisionmaking is the desire to be reelected. ( n7 ) <p> Now let us apply the bureaucratic politics model to Mexico . In the following I present my conclusions in the form of an executive summary ; I will offer much of the data and analysis on which they are based later in the article . Mexico has become a high-priority country in U.S. foreign policy . Evidence of this includes the growing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico issues to cabinet or White House levels ; the frequent visits of cabinet members to Mexico ; the presence of cabinet officers as ambassadors to Mexico have been sworn in ( e.g. , Janet Reno and Barry McCaffrey at the swearing in of U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow ) ; and the amount of newspaper attention to Mexico issues . There are more U.S. government agencies assigned to the American embassy in Mexico than to any other country in the world : thirty by my count . There are over 1,200 official , civilian , U.S. government personnel in Mexico , again the largest number in the world . These numbers do not include the significant number of CIA , DOD , and Defense Intelligence Agency personnel in Mexico . The bureaucratic politics of foreign policymaking used to be confined to three main , sometimes rival agencies : State , DOD , and CIA . Now it includes many more . There are no less than forty-three agencies involved in the drug war alone , and almost all of these are in one way or another involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico policy . Mexico affects their constituents and districts on issues such as jobs , drugs , trade , and schools . Some congressmen carry out their own foreign policies in Mexico . At Davidow 's swearing in , most of the congressmen present were from the Southwest . Congress adds a new and vastly complicating factor to the bureaucratic politics phenomenon regarding Mexico . Not only is there often rivalry and bureaucratic politics between cabinet departments , but there are other rivalries within departments -- for instance , between the Army and Navy within Defense , between Customs and INS within Treasury , between FBI and DEA within Justice . To say these agencies are not always on the same wavelength would be an understatement . Although the ambassador is the titular chief of mission , with all agencies ostensibly reporting to Washington through him , our research revealed that each U.S. agency operating in Mexico conducts a quasiautonomous policy , which it may or may not coordinate with the ambassador . Most agency representatives report directly to their own Washington departments virtually on a daily basis without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mission ( DCM ) . Of course , this will vary depending on the strength , skill , and orientation of particular ambassadors and other personnel . The ever-present problems of bureaucratic rivalry , lack of coordination , and agency secrecy and back-channeling were exacerbated in Mexico during the period when we carried out our research by the absence of an ambassador -- the strong hand at the helm -- for an extended period . Paradoxically , we also found a disconnection between the Washington agencies involved and their representatives " in the field " -- Mexico . It became clear that some Mexico desk officers in Washington , as well as their larger international departments , had no idea what their own agency representatives were doing in Mexico or what specific policies they were carrying out . It is obviously difficult to coordinate policy when Washington officials do n't know what their own agency officials are doing in Mexico City . This is due partly to lack of coordination , partly to Washington 's inability oftentimes to control fully its own representatives in the field , and partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear direction out of their own departments . Clearly , some agencies do not trust others with information and do not inform them of major policy initiatives . The most striking case , analyzed in detail below , involved the Justice Department 's sting operation in Mexico , Operation Casablanca , which nabbed members of Mexico 's banking community on charges of laundering drug money . Justice carried out this operation without informing the White House drug czar 's office or the State Department -- because they feared that State and the drug czar might object and scuttle the operation . From this episode it became clear that the United States has two drug policies in Mexico : one run by Justice and DEA and one run by State and the White House . Neither the right hand nor the left knows fully what the other is doing . Actually , our research shows we have not just two but multiple , often unconnected , sometimes rival drug policies toward Mexico . Because Mexico is so important , many of the big issues in U.S.-Mexican relations are immediately bumped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels . But that is the level at which the least Mexico expertise is brought to bear and at which Mexico issues , rather than being resolved quietly , become the most politicized and controversial , and therefore become virtually incapable of resolution . At this level , also , attention spans may vary , other more immediate issues may suddenly take precedence , or the sentiment may develop that we 've already done enough ( with NAFTA ) for Mexico . A high priority has been placed on interagency cooperation in implementing policy regarding Mexico . That is why so many issues regarding Mexico get bumped up to cabinet level ( at lower levels there would otherwise be very little cooperation , let alone resolution of interagency disputes ) , why there is a drug czar in the White House ( so he can coordinate among cabinet secretaries ) , and why there are so many interagency task forces on Mexico . However , there is often less cooperation than meets the eye ; the sharing of equipment and resources has not worked out very well , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating in Mexico . U.S.-Mexico relations are so sensitive in many areas that U.S. representatives must sometimes deny that they exist . For example , the Department of Defense has as least forty-seven cooperative programs with the Mexican military . Yet because of Mexican nationalistic sensitivities on one side and congressional concerns over human rights on the other -- and because DOD has been " burned " numerous times previously on some of these programs -- DOD insists publicly that it has " no programs " in Mexico . More on this deception below . The Mexico case is complicated by the fact that U.S. states , counties , localities , regional entities , and border areas are all conducting their own foreign policies in Mexico with their Mexican counterparts without necessarily involving the State Department or the federal government . The U.S. Constitution and numerous Supreme Court decisions give the federal government a monopoly on foreign policymaking , yet this is violated so often that a whole body of literature has sprung up on what is called " local foreign policy . " These are not just innocent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as water , immigration , drugs , and border patrol . There are so many U.S. programs operating in Mexico that it is impossible to keep track of them all . Even ambassadors and DCMs are sometimes unaware of all the programs being run through their embassies . In addition , quite a number of these programs are hidden from view , even from embassy officials , for fear of public disclosure and resulting embarrassment -- either to Mexico or to the United States . We are used to seeing , let us say , USAID operating perhaps five or six major programs in a specific country , a number that is usually manageable in terms of embassy and policy administration . But every U.S. agency surveyed seems to be running scores of programs in Mexico . And with approximately thirty agencies listed officially on the embassy roster , this adds up to approximately one thousand programs operating in Mexico . That figure does not include the programs of the many agencies operating in Mexico that are not listed on the embassy roster , nor does it include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entities who carry out their own programs in Mexico quite independent of the embassy . When these programs are added in , the figure rises to several thousand ( not including the private sector -- see below ) . No one person could be aware , let alone fully apprised of so many programs . Administrators produce a bureaucratic nightmare when they fail to coordinate , work at cross purposes , drop the ball , and contradict each other . Not only are there bureaucratic politics operating within the U.S. embassy in Mexico City and among agencies in Washington , but the border area itself presents a whole separate arena , complicating U.S.-Mexico policy in a new way . The two thousand-mile border contains gaping holes through which , despite a massive U.S. effort , tons of cocaine and marijuana and thousands of illegal immigrants continue to slip . Part of the problem is again bureaucratic : at least ten primary federal agencies , plus numerous state , county , local , and regional agencies , operate in the border area . These agencies render themselves ineffective because of lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duplicated assignments , and bureaucratic rivalries . New steps are being taken to harmonize border activities through a Southwest border coordinator . Probably these are steps in the right direction , but it seems unlikely they will solve the problems . Because Mexico is a large country and shares a long border with the United States , we conduct more private activities and transactions vis-a-vis Mexico than we do with any other country in the world , except Canada . Involving parties as diverse as the Ford Foundation , human rights groups , soldiers of fortune , tourists , investors , maquiladores , drug runners , and coyotes carrying immigrants into the United States , these private transactions -- accelerated by NAFTA -- have reached a stupendous volume . Although many involve major policy issues , few of these activities are ever coordinated with official U.S. government policy , and some may even be at odds with it . The result is an incredible , uncoordinated cacophony of uncontrollable voices and activities in U.S.-Mexico relations . <p> Virtually every U.S. government agency operating in Mexico is pursuing its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often secret , contradictory , and conducted with varying levels of coordination with the ambassador . Although this means that each agency has a piece of the action and a vested interest in its own programs , the agencies lose overall coordination , harmony , and focus on the larger goals . The lack of coordination , including the downright secrecy in which some programs are shrouded -- as evidenced by the infamous Justice Department sting operation -- have damaged both U.S. interests and U.S.-Mexican relations . The United States does not have one single , well-thought-out policy that it arrived at through the rational actor model . Rather , it has scores of policies toward Mexcio . Ultimately , having so many policies means having no policy at all , and that is both dysfunctional and self-defeating . RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AS FINDINGS <p> Normally in an article of this kind , any mention of research methodology is confined to a dreary appendix . But in this case the methodology itself merits mention , since it turned up a variety of interesting findings about the bureaucratic politics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan was to inventory all the U.S. government agencies operating in Mexico and request information on their Mexico programs . Our list of U.S. government agencies operating in Mexico was derived from three sources : the Federal Staff Directory , the State Department 's Key Officers of Foreign Service Posts ( June 1997 ) , and a list provided by the State Department of agencies accredited to the U.S. embassy in Mexico City , entitled " Agencies for FY98. " ( n8 ) <p> Obviously for a research project like this we employed a variety of sources : in-depth research , library and archival materials , interviews , and when possible , participant observation . But to see what information was available in the public domain , we determined to begin our research by having research assistants contact the U.S. agencies involved and request a statement of each agency 's policies and programs in Mexico . The research assistants were told to describe the research project , to be as open as possible , and to ask politely for whatever public information on Mexico policy was available . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of these responses , a selection of which are included here , tell us a lot about U.S. policy , or the lack thereof , in Mexico : <p> Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms . We were told by the Washington office that ATF policy in Mexico would be " the same as anywhere else , " " like Florida . " However , " to be 100 percent sure " of this , we would need to submit a formal written request according to the guidelines of the Freedom of Information Act . When we called Mexico City , we received a much more cooperative response from ATF officials there . They said it was " no big secret " : ATF 's role is " to assist the Mexican government in tracing all U.S.-source firearms seized in Mexico . " <p> Department of Agriculture . General information about the department was available on the department 's Web page . However , even though it has numerous programs in Mexico , Agriculture headquarters in Washington , including the international office , did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agricultural Affairs office at the U.S. embassy in Mexico . But that office would not give out any information about its programs ( presumably because they touch on the hot drug issue ) without an official request letter sent to the office director in Mexico City . Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) faxed such a letter on 29 June 1998 , but has yet to receive a response . <p> Department of Commerce . The Department of Commerce was generally unhelpful but did send a packet of materials . The materials contained no information specifically on Mexico , though they did provide Web site addresses that offered public relations descriptions of investment opportunities in Mexico . <p> Department of Defense . DOD is extremely sensitive these days after a number of recent , well-publicized gaffes and exposures , including revelations of Mexican drug czar General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo 's associations with " The Lord of the Skies , " drug cartel leader Amado Carrillo ; controversial sting operations directed at Mexican banks ; revelations of possibly illegal U.S. training of Mexican troops in counternarcotics and counterinsurgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the military attache 's office . DOD at first told us that there were " no programs " and " no military operations " in Mexico . Probing deeper , since we knew that was false , we were told that there were " several programs " that were " tailored to what each country can live with . " With regard to the Personnel Exchange Program , we were informed that U.S. military branches send their officers to Mexico to provide information on U.S. culture to Mexican officers . ( Culture ? ) In the United States , on the other hand , Mexican military personnel are employed as language instructors in military academies . ( Language instructors ? ) <p> Better and more forthright answers came from the office of International Security Affairs at DOD . We were told that most of the work DOD is doing in Mexico deals with counternarcotics . The United States , we were informed , provides helicopters and other equipment , as well as training in counternarcotics . A special office of Drug Enforcement Policy and Support has been established within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Enforcement Agency . We were informed that the only information available to the public is on DEA 's Web site . That information is very general and nonspecific . In addition , we were advised to consult the National Narcotic Intelligence Consumer Committee annual report , as well as congressional testimony , both of which proved to be quite uninformative . <p> Department of State . The packet we received from the State Department failed to provide the information we requested on Mexico or State 's programs there . On State 's Web site , we found a useful description of priorities for the U.S. embassy in Mexico . The Mexico office at State was helpful in providing the list of agencies that are part of the U.S. embassy in Mexico . Because of its proximity , and because Mexico is a ( maybe the ) primary producer and transshipment point for drugs entering the United States , Mexico has become the primary focus for every government agency involved in counternarcotics . <p> Department of the Treasury . The Treasury Department , Bureau of Customs , said it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to call the U.S. embassy in Mexico . The Customs official at the embassy told us he could not give out any information without " making a few calls . " Ultimately we were directed back to the Policy Division of the International Affairs Office of U.S. Customs in Washington . <p> Federal Bureau of Investigation . We spoke with several offices at the FBI . We were repeatedly transferred ( from the Mexico desk to public affairs to research to the press office ) because no one was sure what information they were allowed to disclose . Finally the press office instructed us to fax a request letter , which we did on August 7 ; we have yet to receive a reply . <p> Internal Revenue Service . We were told that the information we were requesting on IRS activities in Mexico is " not that basic . " Nevertheless ( or is it because of that fact ? ) , we would need to file a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act and guarantee payment of all research and search expenses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available on the Web page , we were told , and is " applicable to all countries . " Specific information on Mexico can be found in the country report . That report proved to be both forthcoming and informative . <p> Obviously , this brief survey represents only one attempt -- and a quite superficial one at that -- at coming to grips with U.S. policy toward Mexico . Clearly , we have employed other sources of information and other methodologies . Furthermore , some of the responses cited can be ascribed to incompetent , unresponsive , bureaucratic ( not entirely unheard-of in Washington , D.C. ) , or ill-informed public affairs officials who do n't know and do n't care what U.S. policy is in Mexico or who are uninterested in being helpful to the public . Nevertheless , even at this superficial level , these responses tend to support the conclusions reached in the first section of the paper about ( a ) the huge number of agencies and programs involved in Mexico , ( b ) the lack of coordination between and within the agencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these programs are shrouded , and ( d ) the effort to shield or disguise what American policy is doing in Mexico . PROGRAMS ASSESSED <p> It is impossible , in a brief article like this , to assess all the complex , often overlapping U.S. policies toward Mexico . Much of the preliminary information , in terms of formal , official statements of U.S. policy , is contained in the appendix . In the next section , therefore , we focus on two policy arenas , U.S. drug policy and military cooperation , because they more or less represent the major U.S. policy priorities in Mexico and because they illustrate many of the general points made earlier . Because of space considerations , we focus mainly on aspects related to the main theme of bureaucratic politics . Drug Policy <p> There are , at last count , no less than forty-three U.S. government agencies involved in counternarcotics . Because of its proximity , and because Mexico is a ( maybe the ) primary producer and transshipment point for drugs entering the United States , Mexico has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Heroic efforts have been made , particularly by the Office of the Drug Czar , to coordinate these agencies and present a single , clear , coherent policy and strategy . The creation of the drug czar 's office during the Reagan administration was itself an admission that the then-existing drug policy needed better coordination . Then , as now , State , Defense , DEA , Customs , Coast Guard , and others were all independently carrying out their own counternarcotics policies , meanwhile entangling in bureaucratic rivalries , jealousies , turf battles , and fights over budgets and responsibilities . The drug czar 's office was therefore located in the White House to give it added clout , and the drug czar was supposed to be a cabinet member . The elevated status would enable him to meet and negotiate with other cabinet secretaries as an equal , knock heads if necessary , and arrive at a coordinated policy . The key question has always been whether the drug czar would be a member of the cabinet or not , and administrations have changed direction several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry McCaffrey , is not a member of the cabinet . Therefore , there are severe limits on his ability to coordinate drug policy among the several departments . The law enforcement agencies see State as " soft " on drugs and have even threatened to bring obstruction of justice charges against U.S. officials who refuse to go along with some . . . schemes . <p> A variety of coordinating groups , interagency task forces , undersecretaries , assistant secretaries , and subprincipals ' groups operate below the drug czar . Quite a number of these serve useful functions , particularly by sharing information . But below the top cabinet level , almost no decision can be made -- unless the principals also concur , which happens irregularly . Many of the meetings of these groups are not necessarily full information-sharing meetings ; rather , one agency hosts a briefing that may or may not provide full information . The other agencies may listen and take notes , but they will not necessarily share their own full information or report fully on the policy initiatives of their agencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the policies of their own agencies . Nor can lower-level officials be expected to reach agreement , let alone have the authority to coordinate policy , since their principals may not be in agreement , fully informed on new initiatives , or yet " on board . " Hence at all levels , but particularly at the very top , there is neither full coordination of U.S. drug policy nor the incentives or authority to achieve it. ( n9 ) <p> The basic split in policy is between those agencies that have primarily law enforcement backgrounds , orientations , and responsibilities ( Justice , Treasury , DEA , FBI , Customs ) and those that are primarily political and diplomatic ( CIA , State , White House , including the Office of the Drug Czar ) . My earlier research ( n10 ) revealed that these law enforcement agencies ( Justice , DEA , and FBI ) are mainly staffed at policy levels -- not surprisingly -- by lawyers . All of these agencies are relatively new to the foreign affairs arena ; they tend to have few personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be dominated by ethnocentrism , and often to have a tunnel vision concerning policy . That is , as law enforcement agencies , legitimately and quite properly charged with the responsibility of implementing and enforcing the law ( U.S. law -- and there is one of the nubs of the problem ) , their job is to carry out U.S. counternarcotics policy . If carrying out this responsibility means harassing , arresting , or ousting military officers , cabinet members , or even the president of another country ( as in the case of Colombia 's Ernesto Samper ) , then so be it . If it means kidnaping Mexicans from their own nation and bringing them to the United States for trial , then so be it . If it means violating Mexican law by carrying guns while operating in Mexican national territory , then that must be done too . If it means conducting a sting operation among bankers in Mexico ( also illegal under Mexican law ) and luring them to the United States for arrest , then that too must be approved . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies whose single-track vision and legitimate responsibilities oblige them to enforce the law -- even if that implies enormous costs in terms of overall U.S.-Mexican relations and even if that is often self-defeating on its own law enforcement terms . <p> The second set of agencies mentioned above has a different set of priorities and responsibilities . State , CIA ( at least its analytic arm ) , and the White House -- including , although the orientation is not 100 percent , the drug czar 's office -- tend to emphasize the larger picture of U.S.-Mexican relations . They tend to see the law enforcement types as cowboys who may well damage U.S.-Mexican relations by their one-track policies and overzealous implementation of them . They do not believe that arresting high-level Mexican officials or drumming high-ranking military officers out of the armed forces is the correct policy . Kidnaping Mexican officials from their own territory , riding roughshod over Mexican laws , and de facto taking over some Mexican government functions is not , they believe , in the long-term best interests of either Mexico or the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a number of these officials are opposed to much of the U.S. counternarcotics strategy , since they believe that drug sales are a crucial element in the Mexican national economy and that successfully removing that component might well destabilize Mexico . Many are not convinced that a " war on drugs " is the right course to pursue or that the drug problem can be solved by focusing on the supply or production side . These agencies , in other words , are concerned with the big picture of U.S.-Mexican relations , which takes place on multiple , complex , interdependent levels and which may well be harmed by a too zealous , unilateral , single-agency enforcement of the U.S. drug policy . In response , the law enforcement agencies see State as " soft " on drugs and have even threatened to bring obstruction of justice charges against U.S. officials who refuse to go along with some of Justice 's more harebrained schemes . When one agency of the U.S. government threatens the officials of another ( including a U.S. ambassador , although in another country besides Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out what the first agency wants to do , that is more than bureaucratic politics run amok ; that is complete chaos and dysfunction . In other words , we have no single counternarcotics policy towards Mexico , but two ( and many more ) conflicting policies , run by conflicting agencies , whose constant feuding and competition threaten to destroy U.S.-Mexican relations . <p> The case that best illustrates these destructive bureaucratic conflicts is the sting operation known as " Casablanca , " carried out by the Justice and Treasury Departments against a number of Mexican bank officials in an effort to catch them on a money laundering charge . Over a three year period , U.S. undercover agents apparently lured bankers working mainly with Mexico 's Juarez narcotraffickers to launder drug money , using such techniques as wire transfers and bankers ' drafts . For their service , the bankers received 2 to 3 percent of the transactions . The culmination of the sting came when American officials lured the bankers to the United States with the promise of a free holiday in San Diego and Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico was often viewed by U.S. policymakers as a difficult , prickly , noncooperative country on such issues as Mexico 's failure to break relations with communist Cuba or to adhere to the U.S. blockade . This case is particularly interesting for a number of reasons . First , Mexican law does not allow sting operations , so U.S. officials were using U.S. laws to indict Mexican bank officials operating in Mexican national territory . Second , for the reason just cited as well as Mexican nationalism -- specifically the sense that Mexican officials were cowed by the United States -- the sting elicited a howl of protest in Mexico , which not only formally objected but threatened to prosecute the U.S. officials who ran the antidrug sting . Third , although we are supposed to be cooperating with Mexico at all levels in the drug war , the sting was carried out without informing Mexican high government authorities or gaining their legal approval for the U.S. actions-apparently because of American impatience with the failure of Mexican prosecutors to make any real progress against drug corruption and for fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sting . Fourth , and most important for our discussion of bureaucratic politics , the Justice-Treasury sting was carried out without informing either the Department of State or the Office of the Drug Czar , or informing them at such low levels and in such a purposely obscurant way that no one would recognize the larger policy implications of the sting . The reason for not fully informing the latter two agencies was Justice 's and Treasury 's fears that State and the drug czar , with their " softer " attitudes on drugs and focus on " the big picture , " would object , leak the information , or scuttle the operation by appealing to President Clinton . Needless to say , State and the drug czar 's office were very angry over being left out of the loop on Casablanca . <p> In an editorial , the New York Times denounced the sting as both unlawful and undiplomatic. ( n12 ) It said that Washington 's failure to obtain Mexico 's approval for an undercover operation carried out on Mexican soil was inexcusable and had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton was obliged to express " regrets " to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo after a wave of denunciation and threats from Mexico . But elsewhere in the United States , denunciations were rather muted , reflecting American impatience with apparent Mexican foot-dragging on the issue and the tendency ( or preference ) of Americans to blame Mexico for our own drug problems . The public undoubtedly supported the sting , and DEA was quick to claim credit for the operation regardless of State 's views . <p> A far more informed and biting criticism came from CSIS 's Mexico Project director Delal Baer , ( n13 ) who at the time of the sting was living and conducting in-depth research in Mexico . She was thus able to assess the impact of the sting as well as of overall U.S. drug policy in Mexico at a level far deeper than U.S. editorialists . Baer criticized a policy in which law enforcement agencies ( Customs at Treasury and DEA at Justice ) are in the pilot 's seat and allowed to operate autonomously from other U.S. agencies and from overall U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. government , untrained in foreign policy , have little understanding of the larger consequences of their tactics . Not only was the sting a diplomatic embarrassment for the United States , but its consequences reverberated negatively through the whole Mexican political system and the entire U.S.-Mexico bilateral relationship , of which Customs and DEA are often blissfully unaware . For example , the timing of the sting threw a monkey wrench into delicate negotiations President Zedillo was conducting with the Mexican Congress over financial reforms -- reforms which are in the U.S. interest to see enacted . The sting also panicked investors -- whom U.S. policy has an interest in encouraging -- who interpreted the operation as indicating the U.S. government lacked confidence in Mexican institutions . The sting and the intense Mexican reaction to it also led to several calls in Mexico for the resignation of their central bank governor and attorney general -- officials whom the U.S. has tried discreetly to support. ( n14 ) <p> Baer goes on to say that while it may not be the responsibility of U.S. law enforcement officials to monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , it is the responsibility of senior officials to coordinate policy among the various agencies involved . They should ensure that such operations are conducted with at least some respect for signed agreements and rules of bilateral cooperation between the two countries , as well as with a sense of the impact of such policies in Mexico and their effect on overall U.S.-Mexican relations . Apparently that was not done in this case -- and indeed this case is part of a pattern in overall US. -Mexican relations . The stage is thus set for a new and recurring confrontation between the United States and Mexico . For instance , Justice and Treasury can be expected to pressure hard for decertifying Mexico as a country cooperating in the drug war , while State and , one hopes , the White House will be scrambling to present the larger picture of U.S.-Mexico interrelations to prevent Congress from making that blunder . Baer concludes sarcastically : What a " victory " for Janet Reno , Customs , and DEA ! They have proven that if the United States dangles $30 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can corrupt them in the same way drug traffickers already have . For this dubious revelation we have put the entire framework of U.S.-Mexican relations at risk . <p> Unfortunately , this case is not atypical of a wide range of U.S. policies -- on drugs and a host of other issues -- in Mexico that emerge as the result of the bureaucratic politics of American policymaking . Reviewing only my own files on Mexico from the last few month reveals such headlines as " The U.S. at Odds With Itself on Mexico , " " Drug War Leader Is Frustrated : Kramek Says Politics Hamper Coast Guard , " ( n15 ) and " 2000 Miles of Disarray in Drug War : U.S.-Mexico Border Effort a Shambles . " ( n16 ) Meanwhile , through the Southwest Border Initiative , the Justice Department continues to operate in Mexico with the same coalition of law enforcement agencies ( Customs , DEA , FBI , the Criminal Division of Justice , the U.S. Attorneys ' Offices , the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program , and state and local counterparts ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither State , CIA , the drug czar , or the NSC is represented . Finally , we have the devastating reports of the General Accounting Office -- about as objective a voice as we are going to get on this issue -- whose consistent conclusion through a series of reports has been : ( a ) " Mexico continues to be the principal transit country for cocaine entering the United States " ; ( b ) " despite U.S. and Mexican counternarcotics efforts , the flow of illegal drugs into the United States has not significantly diminished " ; and ( c ) the effectiveness and usefulness of new laws , new counternarcotics agencies , and new initiatives is limited " due to inadequate planning and coordination among U.S. agencies " emphasis added. ( n18 ) Military Cooperation <p> Over the decades , U.S. military cooperation with Mexico has been exceedingly sensitive and therefore quite limited . While the United States is eager to engage its Mexican counterparts in joint , cooperative activities , the Mexican side has been very reluctant . This stems from a variety of factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the United States defeated Mexico and took 40 percent of her national territory ; constitutional prohibitions against training military units in foreign countries ; Mexico 's extreme sensitivity to U.S. slights and/or intervention in Mexico 's internal affairs ( e.g. , Operation Casablanca ) ; powerful anti-Americanism in the Mexican foreign service , at universities , and among leftist groups ; a strong sense of inferiority on the part of Mexican military officials about their professionalism compared to that of U.S. officials ; a Mexican foreign policy that was historically oriented toward frustrating or opposing the United States on all issues ; a tradition stemming from the Mexican Revolution of 1910 that leads Mexico to be sympathetic to revolutions ( Cuba , Nicaragua ) and revolutionary movements ( the FMLN of El Salvador , for example ) that the United States opposes ; and resentment and jealousy that the United States is a First World country while Mexico remains in the Third World . Doubtless other more immediate factors ( corruption , far lower salaries for the Mexican military than for their U.S. counterparts ) are involved , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as Mexico was peaceful and stable , and the cold war was still on but centered elsewhere , the United States was not preoccupied with these Mexican sensitivities or the lack of contact with the Mexican military . Mexico was often viewed by U.S. policymakers as a difficult , prickly , noncooperative country -- a pain in the neck -- on such issues as Mexico 's failure ( alone among countries of the hemisphere ) to break relations with communist Cuba or to adhere to the U.S. blockade ; her failure to support the 1965 U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic ; her obstreperous and often anti-American support of guerrilla forces in Central America in the 1980s ; and her consistent refusal to support the creation of a U.S.-favored inter-American defense force ( seen as " imperialist , " " antirevolutionary , " and a fig leaf for U.S. unilateral intervention ) or the expansion of responsibilities of the Inter-American Defense Board -- for fear the United States would dominate it as well . <p> But then a number of things happened to force a considerable reappraisal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexican side . First , in the 1980s and 1990s Mexico began to look far more shaky both economically and politically ; the United States ( and perhaps Mexico too , though reluctantly ) realized it could no longer take Mexican stability for granted . Second , the growing realization of their complex interdependence on so many issues led the two countries closer together . Third , there was NAFTA , which the United States initially saw more as a security strategy to help stabilize Mexico than an economic trade agreement . NAFTA made Mexico a " North American country " ( which the Mexicans as well as the rest of Latin America are still trying to get used to ) , established the United States the guarantor in perpetuity of Mexican economic and political stability , and brought the two countries closer together on a variety of issues . Fourth , the end of the cold war not only led the United States to pay greater attention to what military strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan a hundred years ago called its " soft , vulnerable underbelly , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Third World game " of balancing off the United States against the Soviet Union ; the United States was now " the only game in town . " Fifth , the growing traffic in narcotics led Mexico , belatedly , to the conclusion that drugs were not just an American consumption problem , but they could also , as in Colombia , damage Mexican institutions and society as well . From the mid-1980s on , the role of the Mexican military in the counternarcotics effort increased exponentially . Sixth , the uprising in Chiapas and guerrilla activity elsewhere in Mexico revealed how poorly equipped Mexico 's military was to conduct counterinsurgency warfare against a foe that was dedicated , organized , and skillful ( e.g , able to use the media and the Internet to mobilize domestic and international support ) . All of these factors , and doubtless others besides , began to push the United States and Mexico not into a military-to-military embrace but into a slowly evolving , closer yet still prickly relationship , marked by numerous sensitivities and many ups and downs . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States moved slowly in creating confidence-building and cooperative programs over the course of the last three decades. ( n20 ) They took very low-level cooperative steps : welcoming a Mexican military officer at the prestigious U.S. National War College ; accepting a U.S. officer at the Mexican national military academy ; upgrading the U.S. military attache in Mexico City to brigadier general status ; conducting a low-key and low-visibility annual exchange of a small number of officers at the service academies , in foreign language instruction programs , and so forth . Meanwhile , other , potentially larger and more encompassing programs , such as the World War II-created Joint Mexican-United States Defense Commission ( JMUSDC ) , either languished or , as in the case of military assistance programs , remained limited , or in terms of joint exercises were virtually nonexistent . But Mexico has made it plain it does not want to see JMUSDC 's mandate broadened and was particularly opposed to its assuming an operational role . And the hardware or military assistance approach relies entirely on Mexico 's deciding to make a major purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mexico buys significant amounts of equipment from France , Russia , and other sources and thereby purposely limits U.S. influence ; at the same time on the American side , Congress or the State Department may block the sale -- particularly when facing the scrutiny of human rights groups after the 1994 Chiapas uprising . <p> In 1988 the Defense Department adopted a new program for closer bilateral military relations with Mexico. ( n21 ) This program , which predates the end of the cold war as well as the emergence in the 1990s of an entirely new gamut of intermestic issues , still appears to be guiding U.S. policy , although it has been updated . The program directed the armed forces to forge greater military-to-military relationships with their Mexican counterparts through two open-ended stages . The first involved efforts , through exchange and other programs , to provide Mexico with a better understanding of the U.S. armed forces . The second stage involved increased contact , but now on a reciprocal basis . Given the Mexican sensitivities listed above , the program required patience , flexibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire for high-level talks or joint exercises ; U.S. military officials recognized that by law Mexican armed forces were forbidden from participating in any combined or coordinated exercises with any other country and that military units could not leave Mexico to train in the United States . For the Department of Defense , this kind of high-sensitivity relationship was relatively new and unique , but not universally accepted within DOD . It was a remarkably enlightened program , designed by Defense intellectuals who actually knew something about Mexico and were able to see their ideas translated into policy terms . <p> During the course of the early 1990s , these kinds of low-level , low-key contacts gradually increased . Most of them emphasized interservice contacts , primarily involving the Coast Guard and the Navy 's Third Fleet , which is headquartered in San Diego . These included U.S. port visits in Mexico , cooperative search and rescue operations at sea , " coincidental interaction " ( passing information and sharing experiences ) , counterdrug cooperation at sea , antismuggling operations , environmental protection efforts , establishment of a permanent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visiting military or military war college delegations , and so on . This " slow and steady " approach was eventually expanded to include some unprecedented joint training missions in Mexico , like airborne exercises in which U.S. aircraft served as jump platforms for Mexican paratroopers . The DOD strategy clearly was to use these low-level contacts and interchanges both to build confidence with the often hypersensitive Mexicans and to pave the way for bigger and higher-level cooperation in such potentially controversial areas as counterinsurgency and war on drugs . By the mid-1990s , the Department of Defense was proudly ( but still quietly ) saying that it had over forty-five cooperative programs with the Mexican armed forces . <p> But then things began to get out of hand , to go beyond the pale . Part of this had to do with the military 's political culture -- Allison 's organizational model . DOD has many able , energetic , ambitious , gung-ho officers -- Type-A personalities eager to overcome all obstacles and " get the job done " -- who , once they receive their orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suggest . But part of it also had to do with purposeful secrecy aimed at deceiving or going around Congress , as well as circumventing other agencies -- the bureaucratic politics phenomenon . Our focus here is mainly on the latter . <p> To begin with , the context changed . First , U.S. military assistance and sales to Mexico increased dramatically . A country that had long been purposely low-profile from both the U.S. and Mexican perspectives now vaulted quickly to the midrange of U.S. military assistance. ( n22 ) Second , the stakes dramatically increased : Mexico became the primary transshipment point for drugs entering the United States ; guerrilla uprisings , economic collapse , violence and assassinations , and rising crime threatened social upheaval and political instability ; and high-level U.S. officials became increasingly concerned for the fate of its large neighbor to the south . Third , in contrast to the low-key , low-visibility policy of the past , Mexico became high profile and high visibility with the visit of Defense Secretary William Perry in 1996 , followed by a parade of other cabinet-level visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure from the Congress , the public , and the press , abandoned its earlier cautious , deferential , patient , and nonthreatening approach and began a more blatant , high-pressure , even interventionist policy . Instead of allowing Mexico to conduct its own reform program at its own pace , the United States began increasingly to take the lead , increase the pressure , and treat Mexico as " just another banana republic " -- albeit an especially large and proximate one . <p> A few specific examples ( among many ) of the bureaucratic politics of this new relationship will suffice to make the point . First is the celebrated case of General Gutierrez Rebollo , Mexico 's drug czar . That special position had been created in Mexico at U.S. urging and with considerable U.S. pressure . General Gutierrez had been appointed to the post to emphasize that Mexico was serious about counternarcotics , that this was a war on drugs , and to make the position comparable to that of General Barry McCaffrey , the U.S. drug czar . McCaffrey had confidence in General Gutierrez and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What McCaffrey was not aware of was that General Gutierrez was in the service of one of the Mexican drug lords . More than that , this information about General Gutierrez 's drug connections was available to U.S. intelligence , specifically the Defense Intelligence Agency . But in another instance of the right hand not knowing what the left was doing , it was never shared with McCaffrey and the drug czar 's office . <p> Another example is the Joint Combined Exchange Training ( JCET ) program. ( n23 ) The JCET program is funded under a 1991 law that says U.S. troops may go on joint , combined training exercises with foreign militaries overseas if the primary purpose is to train U.S. troops . Oversight of the program is the responsibility of the secretary of defense , specifically the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict , and ultimately the Congress , which passed the measure . But over the years JCET was vastly expanded to encompass activities not intended or anticipated in the original legislation . Under JCET , U.S. forces have trained former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombian armed forces in counterinsurgency and counternarcotics policy , done the same in Peru and other countries , and in general used the program to evade the restrictions governing other assistance programs that involve aid to militaries that abuse human rights . Virtually no oversight of this mushrooming program was carried out by DOD or Congress , and the State Department was seldom informed about the full extent of the training . Some of these agencies preferred not to know too much. ( n24 ) <p> In Mexico the JCET program has been used to train Mexican troops on Mexican soil . This is a dangerous step because of extreme Mexican sensitivities , for historical and nationalistic reasons , concerning the presence of any foreign troops on Mexican soil -- especially American troops training Mexicans in exceedingly touchy counternarcotics and counterinsurgency issues . These issues are especially sensitive because , unlike most Americans , Mexicans are not convinced that drug trafficking for the U.S. market and the presence of Zapatista guerrillas in Chiapas are such unmitigated evils . In addition to the training on Mexican soil , U.S. Army Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican troops who form elite counter-narcotics and counterinsurgency battalions . Because Mexico 's constitution forbids training Mexican units in foreign countries , the members of these battalions are flown to the United States in small groups , trained , and then flown back to Mexico , where these smaller units are reassembled. ( n25 ) But Mexico 's constitution is a hallowed and revered one , and this transparent subterfuge by the Americans to avoid its prohibitions can only be described as stupid and self-defeating . Apparently the U.S. government is under such intense pressure to solve the drug issue that it is willing to violate the Mexican constitution -- one of the main institutional pillars still holding Mexico together -- to achieve that goal . Moreover , once the JCET training is complete , the United States can not control how Mexico uses these troops . In fact , in both Colombia and Mexico these U.S.-trained elite units have been employed less in counternarcotics ( the U.S. priority ) than in counterinsurgency ( the Colombian and Mexican priority ) , where they have committed widespread human rights abuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and within the U.S. Congress which , exempting itself , of course , blames DOD and State for not overseeing these programs more closely . <p> These and other issues have led to storms of protest in Mexico . In summer 1998 Mexico issued increasingly sharp attacks over what it views as " unacceptable interventionist attitudes on the part of the United States . " It was incensed over Operation Casablanca and demanded that those U.S. officials responsible for the sting be brought to Mexico to stand trial for violating Mexican laws . Most Mexicans are convinced ( and Comandante Marcos has charged ) that U.S. special forces are working with Mexican armed forces in Chiapas to wipe out the Zapatista guerillas . Mexican sentiments were further inflamed when two out-of-uniform U.S. military officials from the military attache 's office in Mexico City appeared at the site of recent violence in Chiapas ; after being detained by local villagers , they lamely said that they were there only " to learn the countryside and the culture . " These repeated and often illegal interventions in Mexican internal affairs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of JMET but of a wide range of cooperative U.S.-Mexico programs built up over the years . At the time of writing , the relations between the United States and Mexico were extremely tense on a wide range of important issues . <p> I have treated these two programs , drug policy and military cooperation , separately , but in fact they are intimately interrelated . One need not be an advocate of " militarizing the drug war " to recognize that some degree of involvement and cooperation from both the U.S. and Mexican militaries is necessary to solve the drug problem . At the same time , reforming the Mexican military is essential if overall policy toward Mexico , including democratization and a better human rights performance , is to succeed . However the bureaucratic politics practiced by different agencies in each of these areas has a multiplier effect when applied to U.S. policy as a whole based on democracy , stability , open markets , and free trade . Multiple agencies ' practicing bureaucratic politics in numerous policy arenas compounds the aforementioned problems of chaos , dysfunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to also focus on other U.S. policies toward Mexico , including energy policy , immigration policy , environmental policy , and border policy , we would find many of the same problems of bureaucratic conflict , turf wars , battles for bureaucratic prestige and budgets , ignorance about what other agencies are doing , and the like . The result is not just a confused U.S. policy with the main policy goals often lost in the bureaucratic maneuvering and manipulation , but the possibility of a breakdown in policy , defined as the inability to accomplish major policy goals in Mexico . When U.S. policy ineptness , overreaching , conflict , and sometimes too-heavy-handedness are added to the possibilities for fragmentation and ungovernability in Mexico itself , they become truly frightening indeed . CONCLUSION <p> The United States can not continue to run its foreign policy on this basis . With the end of the cold war , it is domestic politics and bureaucratic rivalries that almost exclusively drive U.S. foreign policy , rather than a hardheaded but enlightened calculation of the national interest and a sense of how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , important neighbor like Mexico . Congress and the White House play politics with foreign policymaking , doling out whole programs to different agencies on political and bureaucratic grounds . Then each agency conducts its own foreign policy with little or no attachment to a central core of principles and interests . And there is precious little coordination between , among , or even within the distinct agencies involved . Both the politicians and the agencies involved seek to curry favor with particular constituencies and pursue their own organizational and bureaucratic self-interests . Operation Casablanca and the JMET programs are the two most blatant examples , but there are many others. ( n26 ) <p> The bureaucratic politics of U.S.-Mexican policymaking has now snowballed way beyond Allison 's original formulation to encompass dozens of offices , departments , and agencies carrying out hundreds if not thousands of programs . The White House , the president , and the National Security Council are supposed to coordinate all these distinct programs , but that is being done ineffectively or so superficially that each agency continues to follow its own route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington but also the myriad offices in the Mexico City embassy , which has more U.S. agencies represented than any other U.S. embassy in the world . What in the embassy is supposed to be a coordinated " family " of operations has become dysfunctional . It is said that " we have no one policy toward Mexico but sixty-seven policies . " <p> The incredible pluralism , verging on chaos , has by now begun to affect the substance of American policy toward Mexico . There are two things that exercise the Mexicans : one is the specific contents of individual U.S. policies -- not our main subject here ; the other is the sheer confusion in U.S. policy , the lack of clear direction , the fact that the United States speaks with many voices on foreign policy , not one . Other nations in this and other times have lamented these characteristics of American foreign policy , but now , and specifically in the Mexico case , the situation is far worse and going beyond the pale . The sheer proliferation ( the world 's largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hand of U.S. policymaking seldom knows fully what the right hand ( actually , fifty or sixty other " hands " ) is doing , and increasingly the political and bureaucratic " games " that one part of the American government tries to play on others ( as in Casablanca ) are now becoming exceedingly destructive and self-defeating . Not only is there rising anger and indignation in Mexico ( n27 ) -- hardly conducive to gaining Mexican cooperation on a host of issues -- but policy effectiveness is also breaking down . This is more than Allison 's famous model run amok ; it is Allis ' n Wonderland . <p>

" At that time , 30 years ago , the Big Apple needed all the help it could get . It was in the midst of a financial crisis the likes of which had rarely been seen in any American metropolis before . At that point , not even a spectacularly effective mayor could have pulled the city back from the brink , so all the spectacularly ineffective Beame could hope for was an answer to his prayer . He did n't get it . <p> Thirty years later , much has changed for the better in New York . But since the April 1975 fiscal crisis the world 's financial capital has continued to lurch from one fiscal crunch to another , up to the present day . Sometimes the symptoms have been more obvious , but even when it has appeared healthy the city 's disease has always been lurking there , just under the skin , waiting to flare up at any moment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the situation than " disease . " New York 's affliction has consisted of a complex web of different , but closely related , ailments . Dissecting Gotham 's budget , it is hard to know where the malign influence of the city 's over-powerful civil service unions leaves off and the crushing burden of its overgenerous social welfare spending takes up . The malevolent effects of City Hall 's growth-stifling taxes and its cringe-inducing bonding practices are practically inseparable . <p> All of which might lull other civic leaders into a delightful bout of Schadenfreude . The only problem is that New York 's syndrome is spreading , and not just to other cities " and towns but to state capitals , as well . The news out of Albany and Sacramento these days sounds eerily similar to New York City 's turbulent fiscal history . Therefore , with three decades of history under the Brooklyn Bridge it is now possible to put the Big Apple under the microscope . And with other cities and states starting down the same path to financial ruin , it is doubly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compelling cautionary tale for local leaders who care to listen . A bad case of the " British disease " <p> New York City can be seen as the first large-scale American outbreak of what used to be called the " British disease " ( France and Germany are also afflicted at the moment ) -- the economic sclerosis suffered by liberal democracies held hostage to the demands of politically powerful labor unions and social service providers . A more technical term for this is " distributional politics , " and Mancur Olson has provided a particularly useful framework for understanding the nature of the problem . Relative prosperity and the illusion that a local economy can sustain the higher taxes that go with bigger government encourages weak government leaders to offer small concessions to special interests , such as municipal unions or vocal advocates for the poor . These concessions snowball over time , creating an ever-larger constituency for government spending and making it increasingly difficult to turn back the clock . New York is a classic example . <p> Gotham certainly has an overinflated social service network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two elements of the " British disease , " labor is the older and bigger problem . It results from a mix of ideology and a politics organized around the systematic purchase of votes . A string of New York mayors either found it convenient to expand the unionized municipal work force or wilted in the face of union strong-arm tactics . <p> The 1975 disaster did not materialize over night . The seeds were sown by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia , who took the reins of a bankrupt city in 1933 and left behind a vastly increased city work force and budget when he ended his tenure in 1945 . LaGuardia forged a partnership with President Franklin D. Roosevelt to create a local version of the New Deal in order to lift the city out of the Great Depression . Over the short term , it was a success : The city would emerge from World War II into an economic boom . But its long-term legacy was a municipal government incapable of supporting its oversized programs and , especially , its gargantuan city work force . This problem only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargaining rights to city employees in 1958 . <p> On its face , Wagner 's move does not strike a modern audience as particularly odd -- it should not be surprising that a Democratic politician would favor union interests . But Wagner 's move broke for good the power of the Tammany Hall machine that had long run the city 's politics , and had been a bulwark of the Democratic party . Once they were able to use collective bargaining to harness the enormous size of the city payroll , the unions quickly supplanted Tammany as the dominant political force in the city . Wagner was reelected to a third term in 1961 by exploiting this unprecedented base of support . <p> As problematic as the Tammany machine had been , New Yorkers might be forgiven if they soon started to miss it . For all its serious failings , at least Tammany had always tried to balance its labor support with the concerns of outer-borough homeowners sensitive to taxes . This balancing act had served as a de facto check on the unbridled expansion of city spending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wagner threw caution to the wind . Spending grew twice as rapidly in his last four years as it had in his first eight , and much of that spending flowed to an ever-increasing municipal work force . That growing work force in turn created an even greater labor constituency than the one that had already propelled Wagner into office . Wagner 's embrace of public-sector unionism , combined with existing civil service rules , provided tens of thousands of city residents with relatively well-paid jobs with virtual lifetime tenure , topped off with generous pensions . <p> The seeds Wagner had sown during his third term started to sprout almost immediately after his successor , John V. Lindsay , took office . Lindsay 's first term began with a labor-relations debacle -- a , 10-day transit strike in January 1966 . Lindsay 's Protestant rectitude and denunciation of the Transit Workers ' Union and its Irish-American leader Mike Quill butted up against Quill 's outright contempt for the mayor . The result : The mayor ultimately threw in the towel , and transit workers enjoyed average annual raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps inspired by the success of their brethren in the transit union , sanitation workers and teachers soon went on strike , marking a pattern of labor unrest that would dog Lindsay throughout his first term . The mayor 's almost gallic propensity for surrendering when the going got tough only fanned the flames of union activism . By the time his first reelection campaign rolled around in 1969 , Lindsay was a different man . As election day neared , he dropped his adversarial stance against union " power brokers , " ultimately winning their political support ( if not their personal affection ) , albeit at the price of even more generous contracts . <p> Which is why Abraham Beame , Lindsay 's colorless , diminutive successor , inherited a massive and growing budget deficit . Beame , however , was not entirely blameless . The Brooklyn clubhouse pol had been the elected city comptroller under Wagner , and again during Lindsay 's second term . His mayoral campaign slogan was " Abe Beame knows the buck , " so he should have known precisely how precarious the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet he seemed as surprised as anyone when the house of cards began collapsing . A bloated army of city workers would be on hand to march all over the city 's balance sheet as the national economy worsened and Gotham lurched towards insolvency during Beame 's first term . <p> By the end of 1975 the city directly employed an astonishing 340,000 workers , an increase of 100,000 since 1959 alone . And that did n't include the 80,000 people who worked for the state Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( which had absorbed the city-run transit system in 1969 ) or the bi-state Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , or the bevy of private firms supporting themselves , almost solely on government contracts . <p> Thus , on the brink of ruin , city politics ( and politicians ) were dominated by extraordinarily large municipal unions . This had come about for several reasons , ranging from LaGuardia 's expansive view of city government 's responsibilities and the expansive work force that went with it , to Wagner 's ploy to break Tammany by granting greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak temperaments in the face of aggressive unions . These mayors had let the union bull into the china shop , and in 1975 it would start thrashing around . The welfare city <p> The enormous work force was symptomatic of another perilous condition -- the city 's utterly unsustainable rate of social service spending . As Wagner expressed it so elegantly when asking Albany , to let him borrow more to finance city expenditures , " I do not propose to permit our fiscal problems to set the limits of our commitments to meet the essential needs of the people of the city . " He said this with a straight face , and with a very generous notion of what the word " essential " meant . <p> LaGuardia had started the ball rolling during the New Deal by introducing a raft of programs to serve the city 's poor residents . Wagner would take these programs to a whole new level , fully incorporating middle-class residents into the welfare state . Some of these programs took the form of indirect taxes and subsidies , such as rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent control as an emergency measure during World War II . Unlike most others , the rent ceilings stayed after the war was over . But other programs required ongoing costs . The proliferation of low-cost housing ( actually targeted at the lower middle class ) under the 1955 Mitchell-Lama program , was just one example . Even municipal jobs became a form of welfare support for the middle classes . <p> After Wagner 's tenure , however , New Yorkers were not quite , ready for what awaited them on Lindsay 's watch . The tall , telegenic Lindsay was viewed as the " great white hope " of American urban liberalism . He rode into office trumpeting a compassionate concern for blacks that led to comparisons with Robert Kennedy . The mayor 's efforts at racial reform made him a favorite of the New York Times and landed him on the covers of Time and Newsweek . His name appeared on vague lists of potential presidential contenders . <p> As primary author of the Kerner Commission report on the Watts Riots that had riled Los Angeles in 1965 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American racism blocked the conventional paths of upward mobility for African Americans , never mind compelling evidence of black economic progress in the 1960s . In Lindsay 's view , it was up to the government to create state-sponsored paths of social mobility for racial minorities . Thus , even at a time when the black male unemployment rate in New York was 4 percent and there were long columns of help-wanted ads for unskilled laborers in the Big Apple , Lindsay managed to double the welfare rolls to over one million . In doing so , he killed two birds with one stone , creating jobs for thousands of middle-class social workers . This would not have been so bad except that , in a condition unique to New York City , the state requires Gotham to foot one quarter of the bill for public income assistance and Medicaid . <p> Lindsay would dig the hole even deeper after the Detroit and Newark race riots of 1967 and 1968 . He became convinced that further social spending was the only sure way to avoid racial violence in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't -- at least New York was spared large-scale problems , although there were numerous small riots and a massive increase in violent crime that amounted to an ongoing rolling riot . But this relative stability had come at a steep price : Although its population was shrinking , and although spending on core services like police , fire , and sanitation declined as a percentage of overall expenditures . New York City 's budget grew by 125 percent during Lindsay 's tenure . Footing the bill <p> The only thing more destructive than such a wholesale expansion in city spending was the way in which Lindsay and his successors set about funding it . To pay for both the union contracts and the vastly augmented welfare population . New York City raised taxes with reckless abandon , while also mortgaging itself far into the future by issuing one wave of municipal bonds after another . <p> The sharp up-tick in taxation started soon after Lindsay took office , when the mayor persuaded Albany to levy the city 's first personal income tax and a commuter tax ( a levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city ) . He also revamped the business income tax . The immediate effects of these tax hikes on individuals and businesses were masked by an economic boom , but as soon as the national economy soured in 1969 major cracks began to appear . In response to mounting job losses , Lindsay increased the city 's personal income tax 75 percent , hiked the sales tax by one penny on every dollar , and expanded the reach of the business tax to include the partnership profits of physicians , lawyers , and other professionals . To make matters worse . Governor Nelson Rockefeller was increasing these same taxes at the state level . By 1975 the marginal state and local income tax rate in New York City was more then 18 percent , while neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut still imposed no taxes on wage income . To a certain extent the tax increases did work -- net city tax receipts rose by 53 percent ( 12 percent in real terms ) between fiscal 1970 and 1975 . But the city was hemorrhaging private-sector jobs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the growth in the budget , which expanded by an incredible 80 percent ( 28 percent in real terms ) in the same period . <p> Not to be outdone by Wagner 's iron-willed determination to spend without a thought for revenue constraints , Lindsay turned to the bond markets . To make ends meet , he vastly expanded the city 's reliance on short-term debt , which rose from $1.3 billion in 1970 to over $3.4 billion in 1974 in nominal terms . To an increasing degree , however , the city was borrowing just to keep its head above water -- using the proceeds of short-term notes to meet current operating expenses and to pay off other notes issued to cover prior expenses . This marked a significant difference from how municipalities are supposed to use borrowing -- issuing bonds to cover capital expenses such as infrastructure investment or individual construction projects . In such cases , the worst that can happen if the bond market heads downhill is that a school project does n't get started , or a road repaving project is delayed for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell game . If the bond markets moved in an unfavorable direction , the ability of city government to carry out its normal day-to-day functions would be in jeopardy . Collapse <p> It was only a matter of time before this house of cards collapsed , and although Lindsay managed to avoid getting hit by the falling sword , his successor , Beame , was n't so lucky . <p> By 1973 , all of the ingredients for disaster were in place . Ornery unions were hovering over the mayor 's shoulder , confident in their own ability to strong-arm City Hall in any contract negotiation . The city was overextended when it came to providing social services , and its welfare liabilities only expanded as misguided tax policies scared off businesses and a recession generated longer unemployment lines . And despite those higher taxes , the city had been resorting to increasingly risky methods for financing its obligations . The Arab oil embargo of 1973 was enough to push Gotham over the edge . <p> That embargo and the recession it sparked caused an overall worsening of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , it led to a general tightening in the broader market for municipal bonds . The bean-counters did the best they could to keep the situation under control , but by the spring of 1975 the game was up . The city could not find any takers for yet another seasonal offering of tax anticipation notes ( a type of short-term bond designed to tide the city over until its next round of tax revenues starts pouring in ) . Beame was forced to plead publicly for investors to buy the notes . When that did n't work , Gotham was officially flat broke , and there was a danger that the city would simply default on its debts . Something had to be done . <p> But what ? The city had no hope of growing its way out of the hole . Burdened with backbreaking taxes , the city 's economy had been in free-fall since 1969 . Between that year and 1977 , an astounding 570,000 private-sector jobs disappeared . The only real growth industry was government -- even as its balance sheet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 . Meanwhile , getting labor concessions proved nearly impossible . The unions would eventually make limited concessions , but for a time it looked like they would sink the city with a general strike and mob violence . When Beame called for city workers to forgo a 6 percent pay increase scheduled for July 1 , 1975 , the city 's Municipal Labor Coalition responded by bringing tens of thousands of protestors into the narrow canyons of lower Manhattan in a raucous protest against the First National Bank ( later CitiBank ) , which union leaders and liberal politicians had declared " the number one enemy " because , as a major bondholder , it had expressed doubts about the city 's solvency . Beame 's program of limited layoffs sparked a wave of sick-outs , protest strikes , and walkouts by workers performing essential services such as sanitation . City Hall itself came under siege as the pink slips started issuing forth , and laid-off cops blockaded the nearby Brooklyn Bridge , hurling beer cans at their still uniformed brethren and letting the air out of tires to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor leaders wanted a general strike , but it quickly became apparent that the federal government was not going to offer a bailout . This forced the unions to confront a frightening possibility : With no federal help forthcoming ( remember Gerald Ford 's famous " Drop Dead " speech in the fall of 1975 ) , the city could go bankrupt . And if that happened . City Hall would be in a position to scratch all the generous labor contracts and start over . This threat ultimately led the union leadership to rethink their position . How not to fix a city budget <p> The city 's fiscal rescue was financed by the Municipal Assistance Corporation ( MAC ) , created by governor Hugh L. Carey . It would prove only a partial cure : Statutory reforms achieved fiscal transparency and improved financial planning , but left the city 's propensity for excessive spending largely unchanged . MAC was a state entity handed a dedicated tax revenue stream to allow it to convert the city 's short-term debt into more secure long-term bonds . Financially , MAC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . But ironically , that very success reduced the pressure to address the city 's underlying problem -- that it was spending beyond its means . It was as if a high-living homebuyer had , among his spending excesses , purchased a house that was too expensive for him given his income . But rather than scaling down his spending , he instead went in search of an accommodating bank that would allow him to stretch out the refinancing of his mortgage on slightly more favorable terms . <p> MAC also had a second , more subtle irony . It ultimately provided a convenient opportunity for the unions to win easy political points without making significant concessions . They could do this by agreeing to let the city pension plans purchase MAC bonds . They had initially resisted the idea when they were first dragged ever-so-reluctantly to the negotiating table . However , they eventually " gave in , " as soon , cynics might argue , as labor leaders realized they had nothing to lose and everything to gain . <p> Then , as now , public pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's constitution . City taxpayers were ultimately responsible for making good on earlier poorly considered pension promises to the unions . So despite their high-minded talk of heroic self-sacrifice in taking a risk and purchasing the new MAC bonds , the unions were " gambling " with house money . They would get their pension benefits no matter what . But they did gain something from their so-called concession -- they created the public perception that they were trying to play nice with the city . <p> Such ploys , combined with Beame 's apparent inability to push a hard bargain with labor , paved the way for more aggressive union tactics as the crisis wore on . Barry Feinstein , leader of a Teamsters local involved in the negotiations , knew how to play rough . In 1971 , his union members had released raw sewage into the city 's waterways during a contract negotiation . He later compared the unions ' strategy during the fiscal crisis to " guerilla warfare . " And it worked . Considering what could have happened , the unions fared quite well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly through attrition or transfer to state payrolls rather than through layoffs . A scheduled 1976 pay increase was deferred , and there was no base increase at all in 1977 and 1978 . The city withdrew half its subsidy on employee pension contributions , representing a small cut in take-home pay for many of the remaining workers . But the pensions themselves remained untouched , as were longevity raises and cost-of-living increases . By 1978 , the unions were negotiating for pay increases again , and over the next four years base pay increased by a compounded rate of 26 percent . During the period from 1975 to 1983 , the number of city workers was cut by 20 percent . But total compensation costs per worker for the rest actually increased 4 percent after inflation . <p> What ultimately saved the city was a " happy " coincidence . The misery-inducing inflation of the late 1970s translated into a faster growth in the city 's tax receipts , while effectively reducing the relative size of the city 's overhanging fixed-interest debt and pension obligations . Third-world countries typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such tactics -- creating inflation to evade creditors . In New York City 's case , it just happened by accident . <p> Perhaps this is why few outside the circle of professional fiscal monitors cared at the time that the politicians had almost completely dropped the ball when it came to reform . Certainly , they had managed to push through a new Financial Control Board ( FCB ) to oversee every aspect of the city 's budget . And the FCB and MAC between them managed to force austerity measure on Beame and his tougher successor , Edward Koch . But by 1978 , with President Ford 's " Drop Dead " talk in the past , the federal government stepped in first with a raft of emergency loans and then a federal loan guarantee to back up city debt . <p> And , by the early 1980s , even Koch 's fiscal tough talk had largely fallen by the wayside . Buoyed by state cuts in income tax rates between 1978 and 1981 , and Reagan 's tax cuts in 1981 , the stock market started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely dependent on this enormous sector of its economy , good times on Wall Street cleared the way for a return to the status quo ante . Between 1980 and 1989 , the city budget nearly doubled in size , growing almost as rapidly in absolute terms , and relative to private value added , as it did in the 1960s . Koch added 57,000 full-time positions to the city payroll , more than offsetting the job cuts instituted during the crisis . By 1990 , when Koch was succeeded by David Dinkins , the size and cost of municipal government was as big as it had ever been . <p> There were occasional stretches of fiscal constraint . On the basis of his campaign rhetoric , Rudy Giuliani , Dinkins 's successor , seemed likely to be another story . He pointedly refused to rule out layoffs in his initial budget message , putting the unions on the defense . He sold off assets like the city 's radio and TV stations , tried to start selling the city hospitals ( until he was blocked by the courts ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some services . He was particularly successful in contracting out social service programs to nonprofit agencies . Facing , a cash shortfall and desperate to reduce costs lest the city be taken over by the financial control board , Giuliani made welfare reduction a top budgetary priority . Trumpeting the theme of work , he split the labor-liberal coalition by enlisting the public-sector middle class in support of welfare reform . The strategy worked , and in one of his signal achievements Giuliani began to sharply reduce the rolls even before federal welfare reform legislation was enacted . <p> But in doing so , he also perpetuated the unsustainable costs of the city 's public-sector work force . His last financial plan , adopted just two months before September 11 , 2001 , contained what amounted to a $2 billion operating deficit covered with surplus funds from prior years . Giuliani effectively mortgaged a portion of the city 's future economic growth to make good on promises to city workers . <p> Whoever succeeded Giuliani was destined to inherit an unbalanced budget ; the World Trade Center attack simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has relied heavily on tax increases and borrowing to close a budget gap that reached $6 billion early in his tenure . His unwillingness to challenge New York 's distributional politics and entitlement culture virtually ensures a continued long-term decline in New York 's relative economic growth . Giuliani 's achievements notwithstanding , it still seems like city leaders are acting as if they have learned nothing from the experience of 1975 . One-party dangers <p> At a remove of three decades , the fiscal crisis can seem like nothing but a distant tragedy . And yet if one looks at the current trials and tribulations of a certain large . West-coast state , all of a sudden the lessons of the New York debacle take on a new importance . <p> What are those lessons ? First , it 's not the economy , stupid -- it 's politics . Rereading the history of the Big Apple 's fiscal crisis , one of the most striking aspects of the sad story is that the decline into chaos was more or less gradual , starting back in the 1930s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point : Normal economic cycles were not ultimately to blame for New York 's fiscal crisis , or for its recurring problems since then . A particular economic event -- the oil embargo -- might have been the straw that broke the camel 's back . But the camel was already badly in need of a chiropractor . What made the camel vulnerable was its long history of distributional public-sector politics that took the private sector for granted . The motivation for such policies did not matter -- Wagner 's grant of collective bargaining rights as a calculated ploy to break Tammany was just as destructive as Lindsay 's high-minded , but woefully misguided , effort to solve racism by putting much of the city 's African-American community on to the dole , which in turn was just as damaging as Beame 's lack of leadership in the face of mounting budgetary danger . <p> It is worth considering New York 's particular brand of distributional politics . As Olson 's generalized theory would predict , the city 's death spiral was made possible by the fact that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparative advantage in several highly lucrative sectors , an advantage that would help mask the deleterious effects of redistributionist policies at the start by attracting similar businesses despite the tax rates . All a politician needed was to create a steeply progressive income tax and he would be good to go . <p> A lack of political competition is crucial , too . Despite the election of three at least nominally Republican mayors in the last 40 years , the Republican party has virtually ceased to exist as an organized political force outside the smallest borough , Staten Island . The city 's 1992 term-limit law brought a predictable termination date to the Giuliani era ( a period of relative budgetary restraint ) , but has made no difference in the overwhelmingly Democratic makeup of the city council . This means that even the most irresponsible politicians have a high likelihood of retaining their seats , since as long as they squeak through a party primary they are unlikely to face a serious challenge in the general election . Coming soon to a state near you <p> The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its incomplete recovery is that the city has proven to be not an outlier but a front-runner . That is , it was not the exception so much as it was the first occurrence of what could become the rule . <p> Consider California . Its comparative advantage in high-tech , industries led computer entrepreneurs and " dot-com " millionaires to flock to Silicon Valley , a region that provided a seemingly limitless supply of new revenue during the expansion of California 's distributionist politics in the 1990s . As a result , wealthy California satisfied its highly organized public-sector interests by spending the state into near bankruptcy . In real terms , the state 's general fund increased 68 percent from 1994 to 2001 , thanks in large measure to skyrocketing personal income tax receipts from stock options and capital gains , which reached a full one-quarter of general fund revenues . This meant that California was exceptionally vulnerable to a stock-market downturn . Innovations in public financing , some of them pioneered during Gotham 's 1970s bailout , helped California dig its way out of its hole for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon , the Golden State will merely lurch from one bout of near-insolvency to the next , just as New York City has for most of its post-crisis history . " <p> In short , it can happen again . It could happen in New York state . It is still too soon to say whether it will happen in California , although Californians may now have , in Arnold Schwarzenegger , a governor who might avoid the political timidity that plagued New York . The problem is political , not financial or economic . As the state-and local-government share of an economy continues to expand , such crises will become more common . Carried by irresponsible politicians , the disease of New York City-style public-sector politics can spread elsewhere . <p> By E. J. McMahon and Fred Siegel <p>

Roman gourmand and chef who wrote copiously on elaborate food preparation and presentation , leaving us with an invaluable insight into the culinary mores of his contemporaries .

( The full translation of this book , along with extensive commentary and the complete original text , can be found in A Soup for the Qan , by Paul Buell and Eugene Anderson . ) In his dishes , from lamb-stuffed eggplant , with basil-garlic yogurt sauce to deep-fried fish cakes flavored with mandarin orange and the bitter spice asafoetida , he was creatively combining flavors from the wide sphere of Mongolian influence , from Baghdad to Beijing , centuries before the words " fusion " and " cuisine " were ever used in the same sentence . <p> Or what about the nameless cooks who scribbled down their tips in cuneiform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became all the rage in today 's chic bistros , chefs in the cradle of civilization were , if the clues they left on clay tablets are to be believed , dismembering tiny game birds , roasting the legs , and braising the bodies before carefully reassembling them atop a round of flatbread and garnishing them with watercress . <p> The Maya were not lacking for culinary achievements either , as we know thanks to European observers , archaeological evidence from trash heaps , and a direct culinary heritage that can be traced forward to many of today 's Latin American cooking traditions . They made good use of the many foodstuffs native to the New World , such as tomatoes , maize , turkey , and chile peppers , to create a complex and flavorful cuisine , and the tamales and salsas ( not to mention chocolate ! ) they invented today grace tables the world over . <p> Long before superstar chefs started experimenting with trout ice cream or tomato foam , adventurous foodies from Mongolia to Mesopotamia to Mayapn were paving the way . I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-create some of their most appealing dishes for a group of brave guests . <p> THE FIRST DIFFICULTY a twenty-first-century home cook runs into when attempting to explore cuisines hundreds or thousands of years old is in establishing the ground rules . Does one make use of refrigeration ? ( The answer , after a brief but definitive analysis of logistics : an emphatic yes . ) What about mutton , one of the most common meats throughout the Old World but now almost impossible for the common consumer to obtain in this country ? Would I be cheating if I settled for lamb ? ( In America today , sheep are slaughtered almost exclusively before the end of their first year , making them technically lamb . Anything older is very , very tough -- to buy , I mean , although I presume it also presents a challenge to the incisors . ) And what about all those archaic food-preparation methods ? I possess neither a horse under whose saddle I can shove meat for tenderizing , as the Mongols did , nor a yard into which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then there are the Sumerian recipes that call for blood . Is it safe to cook with blood ? Is it even legal ? <p> Mesopotamians were not the only ones to use blood in their cooking , and they were most likely not the first , either . Blood , after all , is full of iron and protein ; it 's also tasty , with a meaty flavor not unlike liver . And when added to a dish with some liquid in it , say turnips braised in broth , the blood acts as a thickener much like flour or cornstarch , only more so ( and with a more disturbing color ) , creating a thick , dark brown sauce . This binding quality made blood valuable to early cooks trying to raise the bar on their culinary endeavors . The cooks of the Mongol court disregarded the religious taboos of some of the empire 's subjects when they used sheep 's blood as a binding agent in noodles , both to add nutritive value and to make the dough easier to handle . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood to bind the fillings for their blood sausages . <p> Which is why it 's a little surprising to me that everyone I tried to buy the stuff from thought I was a Satan worshiper . <p> Whether I was talking to ethnic butchers in Queens or a gentlemen farmer selling his organic lamb chops and wool at a bustling , upscale green market in Manhattan , the tenor of a previously amicable conversation would change drastically upon mention of the word " blood . " Friendly , open faces would close up , turning wary , suspicious . The answer to my query was always some variation on , " Oh no , we do n't have that . " One sheep farmer said she could provide blood , but with a condition . " I 'll have to get you to sign a form indicating that the blood will not be used for human consumption . " <p> Not be used for human consumption ? What exactly was I getting myself into here ? <p> Finally , after weeks of failure , I walked into a Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to get the precious stuff -- a gallon jug of frozen beef 's blood , USDA approved if you can believe the cap . It was n't until I 'd paid 15 bucks -- the going rate for a gallon of cow blood , salinated to prevent coagulation-and was on my way out that the guy asked : " So what are you , a vampire or somethin ' ? " <p> Ingredients in Hu 's book posed different sorts of challenges . The carp for his fried fish cakes , for instance , is just an overgrown goldfish , which hardly anyone eats anymore . I found mine -- and had it executed by bludgeoning -- at a fish monger 's stall deep in Chinatown . Then I carried the creature 's butchered remains with me uptown a dozen or so blocks to an Indian grocery , where I obtained , for the same recipe , a small vial of asafoetida , which is a powdered resin from a plant in the fennel family , yellowish in color with a distinctive odor not unlike burned garlic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our foodie forebears-but it was nothing compared to the cooking . <p> Here our shadowy Mesopotamian friends threw a few wrenches into the works . Unlike Hu 's detailed book , clearly intended as an instruction manual for healthy and flavorsome eating , the three cuneiform tablets I referenced -- happened upon unexpectedly among the tablets of the Babylonian collection at Yale University and translated by Jean Bottro in The Oldest Cuisine in the World-are essentially bits of information being passed from one professional cook to another . Knowledge of cooking methods is often taken for granted ; in the recipe for turnip broth , for instance , the cook is to " prepare the water " ; no further clues are forthcoming . In other instances , ingredients themselves remain mysterious . Bottro guesses when he can , based on other direct and indirect sources , but when it comes to ingredients such as samidu and kisimmu , the scholar is stumped . <p> While an author engaged in respectable research must refrain from undue speculation , guesswork is par for the course when you 're a contemporary home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , the following instructions for " amursnu-pigeon in broth " : " ... after cooking in broth and removing the amursnu-pigeon from the pot , you wipe it off .

" <p> As you can see , contemporary home cooks have their work cut out for them here . For starters , what the beck is an amursnupigeon ? <p> I wound up using quail . First I removed the legs of the birds . These I roasted in high heat in the oven , while the bodies I gently poached in a broth made with a bit of animal fat ( I used lamb ) , vinegar , leeks , garlic , onions , and shallots . ( The shallots were my embellishment , an almost certainly inauthentic stab at the ingredient samidu . I thought shallots would be appropriate because the Mesopotamians , according to Bottro , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have used leeks , onions , and garlic together as a base in many of their recipes , much as the French use their " holy trinity " of carrots , celery , and onions . ) Then I removed the birds from the broth , dried them , rubbed them with garlic , and served them on small flatbreads made with barley flour , baked on a hot dry . skillet -- the Mesopotamians would have baked them on the walls of a clay oven -- accompanied by bitter greens ( I used watercress ) and sprinkled with vinegar , with the roast legs alongside . Was it anything like amursnupigeon as the Mesopotamians ate it ? Who knows ? But the elements of what Mesopotamians would have found a worthy dish -- the flavors , the nutritional value , the presentation -- were there . <p> Turnips stewed with blood was , by comparison , a fairly straightforward affair . In one pot I braised quartered turnips in water until tender . In a second I sauted chopped onions in rendered lamb fat . Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and crumbled in a small cake that I made of ground black sesame seeds , molded into a sort of freeform brick and baked until hardened . ( This is my admittedly ad hoc improvisation on the seed " cakes " Mesopotamians made as a sort of pantry staple , to be added to everything from beer to , well , turnips in blood . ) Once this flavor base was cooked through , I stirred in the turnips with a couple of cups of its broth , and poured in a quarter cup of blood . The blood looked very much like blood in my measuring cup , but once it hit the hot water it immediately thickened and darkened to an earthy brown color that coated the turnips nicely . <p> The quail broth I used to make an accompanying dish of simple barley porridge , flavored with a garnish of raw leeks , onions , and garlic , finely minced . One of the surprise delights of the meal , the porridge was more successful than the quail as an evocation of the Mesopotamian habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic flavor was also treasured by the members of the Mongol court , if Hu 's book can be taken as an accurate guide . In common with other sophisticated cuisines around the globe , many of Hu 's dishes are named for ones they are meant to emulate in flavor , cooking method , or appearance . " Eggplant Manta , " for instance , is not actually a manta at all -- manta being a sort of stuffed , steamed dumpling -- but stuffed eggplant , the idea being that the eggplant skins fill in for the role of dumpling dough . I cut the eggplants in half , hollowed them out , and stuffed them with lamb ( plus some extra fat ) , onions , and mandarin orange peel , then steamed them . This dish , served with a garlicky yogurt sauce with basil , shows the wide influences cooks of the empire 's court worked with . Stuffed vegetables , as Soup for the Qan authors Buell and Anderson note , were typical of contemporaneous Turkic cuisine , while the orange peel is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is delicious . A lamb and vegetable stew was a smorgasboard of ingredients and methods gleaned from all corners of the Mongolian world -- yams , ginger , apricot kernel paste , carrots , pickles , and even a ten-egg omelet -- sliced up and stir-fried together before being placed in a lamb broth studded with meat . I flavored cakes of minced fish with ginger and mandarin orange , typical Chinese flavors ( this after boning the carp-the arduous process of which goes a long way toward explaining why carp is not so popular these days ) , but also asafoetida , an ingredient much more typical of the Middle East and India . This and the cooking method -- deep-frying -- made me wonder if the inspiration for this dish might not have come from the onion-loving descendants of the writers of those ancient Mesopotamian tablets ! <p> By comparison , Maya recipes seem familiar to our contemporary palates , a meaningful reminder of how much the flavors of the New World have influenced the way we eat today . Using recipes provided by the Legacy Program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Archaeological Research , I made plump corn masa tamales stuffed with turkey ( a dish likely used for both rituals and everyday dining ) , garnished with a lime-spiked salsa , and a thin , bitter version of hot chocolate , sweetened with honey . A simple pumpkin soup of roasted pumpkin , thinned with turkey broth , flavored with honey and allspice , and garnished with pumpkin seeds and scallions , was beautiful to look at and surprisingly delicious as well -- the balance of sweetness , earthiness , and spice , and the textural contrast offered by the pumpkin seeds and onions , made for a complex , contemporary-seeming dish . I finished off with what the UTSA archaeologists call a " Honey-Vanilla Compote . " The dish of mixed fruits -- pineapple , guava , cherries , and grapefruit-stewed with honey and vanilla tasted great . Feasting on these lighter , brighter foods , not so different from what the home cooks of Latin America make today , I felt that it is the Maya 's culinary legacy that will stand the test of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Mesopotamian quail with porridge and bloody turnips , Mongolian mutton stew accompanied by stuffed eggplant and fish cakes , and turkey tamales with salsa , pumpkin soup , and hot chocolate , we were in need of a digestif , to say the least . Luckily , I had on hand some homemade Mongolian-style lamb liquor , which I 'd made by soaking a raw joint of lamb in some bottom-shelf vodka for a week . According to Hu , this concoction " greatly supplements and augments a person . " I do n't know about that . But it did sort of taste like lamb chop -- not half bad , actually . <p> While some of my bolder guests sipped the lamb vodka , we considered . The meal was enlightening indeed . Seeing all the ancient dishes side by side , some surprisingly tasty , others less so , it was apparent that no translation of a cuneiform tablet could demonstrate as clearly that , evolving palates aside , the pursuit of good eating is as old as civilization itself . And maybe the ancients still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that I 'll be mixing up a batch of dry lamb martinis anytime soon .

@@4156441 What do a mouse , an angry girl , and a terrible monster have in common ? They 're all characters intentionally illustrated to provide ways for children to interpret literature for literary understanding # " Alice ? having nothing to do ? peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ' and what use is a book , ' thought Alice , ' without pictures or conversations ? ' " ( Carroll , 1865 , p. 11 ) . # It is likely Alice would be even more enamored with pictures if she encountered contemporary fictional picture books in which illustrations so often play a critical role in developing literary elements -- those building blocks of fiction that enable readers to understand , interpret , and respond to literature . Literary elements such as setting , plot , and character are intertwined and all make significant contributions to a reader 's understanding and interpretations of stories ( Lukens &amp; Cline , 1995 ) . # However , we believe that character may be particularly critical to literary meaning making , and in this article we explore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the characters they meet in fictional picture books and how teachers can help children learn to more fully use this pictorial information . # Characters and Character Development # Characters are important to readers for many reasons . First , characters " enlist readers , hold their interests , unravel plots , and affect lives " ( Martinez &amp; Roser , 2005 , p. vi ) . Kiefer ( 2010 ) observed that characterization in children 's literature is so important that even " long after we have forgotten the names " ( p. 18 ) of picture books from our childhood , we often still recall the names and personalities of many characters because " they came alive in the pages of books , and will forever live in our memories " ( p. 19 ) . # However , characters do more than draw readers in and entice them . Characters have been described as the driving force of stories ( Cullinan &amp; Galda , 1998 ) , and Emery ( 1996 ) argued , " character states , such as their desires , feelings , thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story together " ( p. 534 ) . # These arguments suggest that character understanding may be crucial to readers ' literary meaning making , especially in light of the interconnections that exist among character intentions , conflicts , and thematic understanding ( Golden &amp; Guthrie , 1986 ) . In fact , in her study of children 's understanding of literary theme , Lehr ( 1991 ) found that children who discussed character motivation were better able to talk about the central theme of the stories they read . Therefore , understanding characters may serve as an important pathway to deeper levels of meaning . # Character Development Through Illustrations # Characterization in stories -- including picture books -- can be complex , encompassing character traits , motivations and goals , feelings , and relationships . In stories without illustrations , we know that readers learn about a character through what the character says and does , through what others say about the character , and through what the narrator reveals . However , how do these different facets of character emerge in picture books ? # The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stories are told through the interplay of pictures and text ( Arizpe &amp; Styles , 2003 ; Nodelman , 1988 ; Schwarcz &amp; Schwarcz , 1991 ; Sipe , 2008a ) . It is because of this interplay that picture books have been described as stories told twice , " once through the text and once through illustration " ( Agosto , 1999 , p. 267 ) . # Given the significant contributions of both illustrations and written words in picture books , readers must thoughtfully attend to both sign systems -- the visual as well as the verbal -- to deeply understand the characters . However , Sipe ( 2008a ) argued that reading visual images is not something children do automatically ; rather it is something that must be learned . Thus readers need to develop insights into the principles of visual art , including understandings of the commonly held meanings conveyed by color , line , shape , and texture ( Sipe , 2008a ) . # For example , when children encounter the extensive use of red in story illustrations , if they are familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perceive anger , danger , or love depending on the context of the color 's use in the illustration . Also , when children are taught to understand artistic conventions such as perspective , size , position on the page , and the use of frames , they are better able to interpret illustrators ' uses of these devices when they encounter them in the artwork in picture books ( Moebius , 1986 ) . # Although these principles and conventions come into play as illustrators work to craft the various elements of stories including character , there is not complete agreement on how characters are revealed in picture books . In their discussion of characterization , Nikolajeva and Scott ( 2001 ) maintained that the illustrations in picture books lend themselves to developing external facets of character such as appearance , gender , and age , whereas internal facets of character are more likely to emerge through the author 's words . Nonetheless , these scholars do concede that some facets of inner character can be revealed through illustrations by means of character " poses , gestures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 82 ) . # Deliberate Attention to Visual Possibilities # However , illustrations in picture books may contribute far more to character development than what Nikolajeva and Scott ( 2001 ) suggested . In their analysis of the development of literary elements in picture books , Martinez and Harmon ( in press ) found that visual information in picture books for younger children played a dominant role in the development of character traits , interests , and emotions . Moebius ( 1986 ) and Nodelman ( 1988 ) also described ways that illustrators convey meaning about character , including through the use of color and the positioning of characters on the page . # Given the potential importance of illustrations in character development , young children reading ( or listening to ) picture books must attend not only to the words of stories , but also to visual information if they are to understand the characters they meet in picture books . In his investigations of young children 's meaning making during storytime , Sipe ( Sipe , 2008a ; Sipe &amp; Brightman , 2005 ; Sipe &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the feelings , thoughts , and motivations of the characters they met in stories , and illustrations were a rich source of information the children used in making these character inferences . Sipe also reported on some of the visual conventions the children relied on as they worked to understand characters , including the use of color to convey emotion and line to convey character movement . # However , illustrators use a variety of devices to bring their characters to life , and given the importance of picture book illustrations in developing characters , we wanted to gain greater insight into the kinds of visual information that young children draw on in their attempts to understand characters . Therefore , we undertook an investigation in a second-grade classroom to address the following question : What kinds of pictorial information do young children use to gain insights into the characters they meet in picture books ? # What We Did # The second-grade classroom in which we observed is located in an elementary school in rural South Texas that primarily serves white ( 49% ) and Hispanic ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys and 8 girls , in the class in which we conducted our study . # Because we wanted to know what kinds of visual information children use to understand characters , we selected three picture books with particularly rich characterization for the teacher to read aloud to her students -- When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really , Really Angry by Molly Bang ( 1999 ) , Leonardo the Terrible Monster by Mo Willems ( 2005 ) , and Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse by Kevin Henkes ( 1996 ) . Table 1 contains summaries of the three books . The classroom teacher indicated that she had never read the three books to her students . # For each of the three stories , we selected three illustrations to use in talking with the children . We chose each illustration with an eye toward ensuring that the children would have the opportunity to talk about pictures in which illustrators used a variety of visual elements and conventions to develop characters . # In Table 2 , we describe the illustrations the children were asked to talk about and identify devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the pages in the books are not numbered , we identify the pages to which the children responded by referring to openings , using Sipe 's ( 2008a ) definition of the term in which the " first opening is the two pages where the text of the book begins and the openings are numbered after this " ( p. 256 ) . # Over the course of three weeks , two of us ( Lori and Angeli ) visited the second-grade classroom once a week during story time . On each visit we observed as the teacher read aloud and talked with her students about one of the stories . During story time the teacher invited the students to sit on the floor in front of her as she read . # The teacher ensured that each student could see the illustrations in the book , and she even asked students to move closer when she thought they might not be able to see the pictures . When there were relatively few words on a page , the teacher held up the book as she read so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more extended text , the teacher typically would read and then hold up the book so children could see the accompanying illustration . # Story time was an interactive experience in this second-grade classroom . The teacher typically began each story session by talking a bit about the issues in the story . For instance , before reading the When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really , Really Angry , she asked the students to think about what makes them happy and to think about what it feels like when they are angry . # During and after the storybook reading , the teacher asked questions and invited discussions about the book . During the reading , the children were often asked to make predictions about what might happen next in the story . The teacher also posed simple recall questions and encouraged students to make connections between the experiences of story characters and their own personal experiences . However , little if any of the talk during the read-alouds focused on characterization as revealed through illustrations . # The first week we visited the class , the teacher read aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second week , she shared Leonardo the Terrible Monster ; and the third week , she read aloud Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse . As we observed each read-aloud , we audio recorded the talk and took notes so that we could more fully describe the story time interactions . Immediately after each read-aloud , we talked with each student individually in the school library . # During these interviews , we showed each child the pre-selected illustrations from the book one by one and asked , " What do you see in the illustration ? " We typically followed up this initial question by asking , " How do you know ? " or " What clues help you know that ? " Although we were interested in gaining insight into the pictorial information children used to understand the story character , we never specifically asked the children to talk about character . We transcribed the audio recordings of the interviews . # Student Insights Into Character # Even though we did not ask the children specifically about the characters in the stories , this was the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed the illustrations -- illustrations chosen because they featured main characters prominently . The children made a variety of inferences about the characters , including inferences about character feelings , thoughts , and relationships , as well as inferences about changes in characters ' feelings , thoughts , and relationships . # As we looked closely at the children 's responses to determine the kinds of visual information they used to make character inferences , we found that they were particularly attentive to pictorial story content , such as character actions , facial expressions , and body posture , and the way in which characters related to one another . Children also referred to some of the elements of art in supporting character inferences , in particular , the illustrator 's use of color and line . However , we found that the children did not appear to be attuned to many of the visual devices intentionally used by illustrators . In many cases , they typically did not talk about symbols , position of characters , and other visual content that clearly conveyed important information about characters . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview transcripts that reveal the kinds of visual information the children drew on in supporting their inferences about the characters they met in the three books . # Pictorial Content # The second graders we interviewed were all attuned to three types of pictorial content that revealed significant information about characters -- facial expressions , body postures , and characters ' actions . # Facial Expressions . In the book When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really , Really Angry , the facial expressions of the main character conveyed important information about Sophie 's ( the main character ) feelings . Like most of the children , Emily ( all names are pseudonyms ) talked about the way in which the illustrator drew Sophie 's eyes , mouth , and eyebrows in opening 6 ( see Table 2 for descriptions of openings ) of the story and understood what this revealed about the character : # Interviewer ( Lori ) : Tell me about this picture . What do you see happening ? # Emily : It shows her about to explode because she 's really mad . Because her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interviewer ( Lori ) : What is her face showing ? # Emily : Madness . # How is it showing madness ? # Emily : Her mouth is n't smiling , it 's just straight and her eyebrows are going down . # Action . The children also discussed ways in which a character 's actions yielded insights into the character . For example , in Leonardo the Terrible Monster , Emma , in discussing opening 12 , supported her inference about Leonardo by referring to the actions of the character that were revealed pictorially : # Interviewer ( Lori ) : What 's happening in this picture now ? # Emma : He 's Leonardo happy because he scared a little boy and made him cry . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : Yes ? How do you know that ? How does the picture give you clues ? # Emma : Cause he is going like this ! Emma demonstrates pulling her arm in , doing the same " arm tuck " done by Leonardo. # Interviewer ( Lori ) : Can you describe that ? # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! # Interviewer ( Lori ) : It does ? But how is he doing it ? He is holding his hand how ? # Emma : In a fist and going like this . Emma demonstrates the action again. # Symbol . Two of the illustrations we used contained symbols that revealed information about characters ( see Table 2 ) . Although some of the children talked about these symbols , most did not . In opening 6 of When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really , Really Angry , author and illustrator Molly Bang described Sophie as " a volcano ready to explode " and included an actual volcano in the illustration with the word explode serving as the lava emerging from the volcano . A few of the children , including Caren , talked about the meaning behind this symbol : # Interviewer ( Lori ) : What do you see in that picture ? # Caren : She 's getting really really angry in this picture . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : How do you know ? # Caren : Because there 's a volcano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lori ) : And what does that mean to you ? # Caren : It means that she 's really really really angry ! # Interviewer ( Lori ) : So when you see a volcano you think about ? . # Caren : Something getting angry and blowing up . # Although most of the children did not appear to understand the significance of these symbols , we believe it is telling that some children used them to better understand story characters . # Pictorial Devices # In justifying their inferences about characters , most students drew on their understanding of two art elements -- color and line . # Color . In talking about When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really , Really Angry , almost all the children talked about the illustrator 's use of color to convey information about the main character 's feelings , in particular , associating the use of red with Sophie 's feelings of anger . Many also talked about how changes in color signaled change in the character 's feelings . They stated that the color red meant Sophie was angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding to opening 7 , Aaron talked about this change in color : # Interviewer ( Lori ) : Can you tell me what is happening in this picture ? # Aaron : This is where she is getting all her madness out and she sits there and is alone and where she kind of like talks to herself and tells herself to calm down because nobody deserves that . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : You said that here she is calming down . Is there any clue that tells you she is calming down ? # Aaron : Cause it use to be red around her and now it 's turning orange . She calmed down and came back home . # Although color was not a major device used to convey character information in Leonardo the Terrible Monster , one student did pick up on a subtle use of color when he observed that the background color of the page was " even darker purple " when the character was feeling sadder . # Line . Most of the children talked about illustrators ' use of line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse , which depicts an angry Lilly in one panel with swirling round lines for eyes , Aston had this to say about Lilly 's eyes : # Aston : They 're red and they look mad . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : What else told you that she 's mad ? # Aston : The swirly things . # Although the children justified many of their character inferences by pointing out illustrators ' use of color and line , there were three important pictorial devices that contributed information about characters that most children did not talk about -- the illustrator 's manipulation of size , the position of characters within the illustration , and the breaking of frames that surrounded illustrations . Nonetheless , as the following examples show , a few of the children appeared to understand these devices . # Size . In opening 16 of Leonardo the Terrible Monster , Mo Willems completely filled the double-page spread with a close-up of Leonardo 's thoughtful-looking face . Yet only JoAnn talked about the significance of the size of Leonardo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interviewer ( Lori ) : What 's happening on this page ? # JoAnn : He was making the decision ? that he would be his friend . And not scare anybody anymore . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : You said he was making a decision , what kind of decision ? # JoAnn : A big decision . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : And what gives you a clue that it 's a big decision ? # JoAnn : Because of how they drew his face , everything is big ! # In opening 9 of Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse , Kevin Henkes also uses a change in size to suggest an important character change . In this opening , Lilly is depicted in a series of four panels , and in each panel Lilly is drawn progressively smaller . In responding to this opening , Dallas talked about this change in size : # Interviewer ( Lori ) : What 's happening in this picture ? # Dallas : She is getting smaller and smaller and smaller . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That she is getting sad . # Although JoAnn and Dallas appeared to understand the significance of these size changes , size may be a more subtle artistic device , because few of the other second graders made references to these size changes . # Breaking the Frame . In opening 16 of Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse , Lilly is again portrayed in a series of four panels , and in the fourth panel , a joyful Lilly is seen leaping out of the panel ( i.e. , breaking the frame ) . Vickie was one of the few children to talk about the significance of this artistic device : # Interviewer ( Lori ) : What is happening there ? # Vickie : She 's getting happy . She 's smiling and she 's skipping and hopping . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : How can you tell she 's skipping and hopping ? # Vickie : Because those lines make her hop . student pointing to a dotted line showing the pathway of the character 's movement # Interviewer ( Lori ) : Anything else you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hopping out of the picture . # Interviewer ( Lori ) : And what does that tell you ? # Vickie : That she 's really happy . # What We Learned # The interview excerpts that we have shared show examples of children using visual information to better understand the characters they meet in stories . However , we also found that the children were not attuned to many types of visual clues embedded in illustrations . This suggests that teachers have important work to do in fostering children 's visual literacy . # The second graders supported their character inferences largely by attending to the facial expressions , body posture , and character actions depicted in illustrations , as well as their understandings of the ways that illustrators use color and line to convey character information . Yet the images we shared with children contained other important visual information that the children either missed or did not talk about . # For instance , in one of the illustrations from Leonardo the Terrible Monster , a dejected Leonardo is positioned in the bottom corner of the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positionality to convey character information . Also , most of the children did not make mention of the symbols illustrators embedded in illustrations or the use of the artistic devices of changing the size of a character and showing a character breaking the frame surrounding an illustration . # We believe that our findings dovetail with the work of others who have explored children 's responses to picture books and suggest that young children are capable of using visual information to understand characters ( Sipe , 2008b ; Sipe &amp; Brightman , 2005 ; Sipe &amp; Ghiso , 2005 ) . Children also appear to be aware of the importance of visual information in picture books . At the conclusion of each interview , we asked each child how the illustrations in picture books helped them . Their responses showed they valued images for the information they provided about characters . # For example , Vera responded by saying , " They help me think what 's happening in the story because the motions that they 're doing . " Mike answered , " Cause they show expression . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing and his action , how he 's feeling . They show his mouth and sometimes they put tears by eyes that show that he 's sad . " JoAnn said that pictures " show if something is big or little or the colors tell you something too . " She went on to say , " When Sophie got really really angry , it showed on the body with colors. " # What Teachers Can Do # Teachers have an important role in enriching " their students ' aesthetic appreciation and understanding of the visual features of picture books " ( Sipe , 2008b , p. 213 ) . In fact , Sipe ( 2008a ) described teachers as the " enablers of children 's meaning making from picture books " ( p. 386 ) . Stepping into this supportive role , with the aim of helping children learn to use illustration clues ( as well as text clues ) to understand characters , requires that teachers prepare for and carefully orchestrate read-alouds. # Preparing for Read-Alouds # Some teachers come to the read-aloud with a background in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge about art , a good first step is building one 's own understanding of how illustrators convey meaning about characters . In Table 3 , we list some resources teachers can use in learning more about the illustrator 's craft . # To explore visual characterization with children also requires the careful selection of picture books for the read aloud . In Table 4 , we include a listing of character-rich picture books and identify visual devices of note that the illustrators of these books use in developing character . # Once a book is selected , we recommend that teachers carefully prepare for the read-aloud . Eeds and Peterson ( 1991 ) envisioned teachers stepping into the role of " curator " ( p. 119 ) , or one who helps students develop literary insights . Preparation is the key to becoming a curator , and perhaps the best preparation is simply lingering over and reflecting on ways in which both the visual and verbal texts work to convey important information about characters . Also , in viewing the illustrations , teachers can ask themselves questions about characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seem to say about the characters ? # * Do the lines communicate meaning about character emotions ? How ? # * Where is the character placed on the page ? What might this say about the character ? # * What is of note about the facial expressions of the character ? # * What do the actions and body posture of the character tell us ? # These steps should help to ensure that teachers will be prepared to guide children in their explorations of the images in picture books . # Orchestrating Read-Alouds # Preparation for a read-aloud is an important first step , but what happens in the read-aloud is of paramount importance . First , teachers must ensure that all the children can see the illustrations and that they have time to linger over them . Just as we extended invitations in our interviews to look closely at illustrations , teachers too can pose such invitations by asking , " What do you see ? " and " How do you know ? " # Teachers can also ensure that children have opportunities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use with more complex picture books ( Pantaleo , 2002 , 2004 ) . As children explore illustrations together , they extend and refine one another 's responses , which is just what happened when Ms. McGlothlin 's students studied the cover of A Beasty Story ( Martin , 2002 ) : # Jacob : I think it is going to be about the four mice and the ghost because they look scared . They look happy right here but the ghosts scared them too much . # Sara : The mouse in the middle is going like this . holding her hands over her mouth # Ms. McGlothlin : Look at the mice real close and see if they are different . # Victor : Because one is like this and the next one is like that and the next one is like this mimicking the motions/facial expressions of the mice on the cover . And they have happy faces . # Sadie : But the last ones have scared faces . # Not only do children benefit from opportunities to explore illustrations collaboratively , but also researchers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insights into illustrations ( and the story ) deepen even further ( Arizpe &amp; Styles , 2003 ) . # Finally , to help children learn more about how illustrators communicate character information , a teacher can step into the role of curator during read-aloud discussions and draw attention to particular artistic devices illustrators rely on to develop character ( Maloch &amp; Duncan , 2006 ) . For example , in sharing Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse , a teacher might highlight the illustration of Lilly " breaking the frame " by noting , " This picture tells me how happy Lilly is ! She is so happy that she is jumping right out of the picture ! " # We began by talking about the importance of character understanding to literary meaning making . In picture books , this means that readers must be able to " read " both illustrations and the text of stories . We believe that the visual aspects of picture books have never received the same attention as written text . Therefore , it is only when we take steps to ensure that children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children will be able to fully explore the characters they meet in picture books . # " Readers must thoughtfully attend to both sign systems -- the visual as well as the verbal -- to deeply understand the characters .

@@4019541 Section : FEATURE ARTICLE <p> THE READ/WRITE WEB , ALSO CALLED WEB 2.0 , OFFERS POWERFUL TOOLS TO AID IN THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS . APPLICATIONS SUCH AS BLOGS AND WIKIS ALLOW USERS TO ADD CONTENT TO A WEB PAGE ON THE FLY , GENERALLY WITH LITTLE OR NO KNOWLEDGE OF HTML CODING REQUIRED . AND ALTHOUGH BLOGS HAVE GAINED SOME POPULARITY AND USE IN SCHOOLS , THE POTENTIAL OF WIKIS AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL REMAINS LARGELY UNTAPPED . THE POWER OF A WIKI LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE A FORMAT FOR COLLABORATIVE CONSTRUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE . CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF A WIKI INCLUDE EASE OF USE ; ABILITY TO CREATE NONLINEAR DOCUMENT STRUCTURES THROUGH HYPERLINKS ; A BUILT-IN MECHANISM FOR REFLECTION AND METACOGNITION ; A MEANS OF TRACKING INDIVIDUAL , SMALL GROUP , AND WHOLE GROUP PROGRESS ; AND SPACES FOR CREATING INDIVIDUAL , SMALL GROUP , AND WHOLE GROUP PRODUCTS . TEACHER-LIBRARIANS AND CLASSROOM TEACHERS CAN USE THESE FEATURES TO DESIGN NEW AND IMPROVED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCES . THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES SAMPLE ASSIGNMENTS AND DESCRIBES FREE WIKI WEB SITES . BEYOND WIKIPEDIA : USING WIKIS TO CONNECT STUDENTS AND TEACHERS TO THE RESEARCH PROCESS AND TO ONE ANOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without believing in the power of constructivist learning . Every day teacher-librarians facilitate the process of articulating research questions , locating resources , organizing information from a variety of sources , and synthesizing that information to create new understandings . Some of the most exciting research happens when students collaborate to pool their research and analyze their data , forming a kind of understanding that would be difficult for an individual student to achieve . <p> The Read/Write Web , also called Web 2.0 , offers powerful tools to aid in this kind of collaborative process . Applications such as blogs and wikis allow users to add content to a web page on the fly , generally with little or no knowledge of HTML coding required . And although blogs have gained some popularity and use in schools , the potential for wikis as an educational tool remains largely untapped . While the reasons for this are open to question , it is clear that it is not because students are uncomfortable with these new technologies . In fact , about half of all teens in the United States create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include creating web pages , blogs , and wikis , as well as remixing content found online into something new ( Lenhart &; Madden , 2005 ) . IN THE IMAGE OF WIKIPEDIA <p> Many of the suggestions for using wikis are imitations of the general concept of Wikipedia : The Free Encyclopedia , an organic , loosely structured process to produce encyclopedia-type content . NeighborhoodWiki ( http : **42;7596;TOOLONG ? title=Main%5fPage ) , for example , features elementary students ' encyclopedia entries on hundreds of topics , ranging from alligators to zxcvbnm , . / ( the bottom row of the keyboard ) . Will Richardson ( 2006 ) suggested that teachers and students collaborate to create wiki textbooks for individual courses and that each year new classes might add to or edit content . Westwood Schools , in Camilla , GA , maintains a wiki that includes collections of student work , class blogs , student-created study guides , and spaces for students to post pages of interest to other students ( Jakes , 2006 ) . <p> In addition to allowing users to add and edit content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many wiki applications feature a back page , usually labeled Discussion , which can be used for reflection and feedback . On Wikipedia , users often use this space to post explanations of edits they have made , to evaluate content , or to disagree with other contributors . This feature is being put to good use by teachers who create wikis for their writing courses . Borja ( 2006 ) cited Paul Allison 's High School Online Collaborative Writing Wiki ( http : **36;7640;TOOLONG ) as an example , on which students used the " Discussion " page to create modern versions of scenes from Macbeth , including 20 versions of the opening witch scene . <p> Many supporters of wikis in education suggest that there is an inherent underlying philosophy that accompanies use of the tool . Richardson ( 2006 ) claimed that " early implementations of wikis in educational settings have shown that the more autonomy teachers give to students in terms of negotiating the scope and quality of the content they are creating , the better " ( p. 65 ) . Heather James ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , the result of assuming too much control . " To really use a wiki , " James said , " the participants need to be in control of the content -- you have to give it over fully . " And Brian Lamb ( 2004 ) asserted that wikis are most effective when " students can assert meaningful autonomy over the process . It is not that authority can not be imposed on a wiki , but doing so undermines the effectiveness of the tool " ( p. 45 ) . WIKIS AND INFORMATION LITERACY <p> Although it is hard to argue with the goal of independent , self-directed learning , this is often more an ideal to strive toward than it is a reality . In fact , there is evidence that careful structuring and scaffolding of concepts and skills have led to some successful wiki collaborations . Moreover , many of the considerations in effectively setting up a learning wiki are related to the information literacy skills that fall within the teacher-librarian 's expertise . For example , in a study of undergraduate engineering students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicol , Littlejohn , and Grierson ( 2005 ) noted that the organization and structure of information and resources affected team sharing and the learning of design principals . In one of two case studies that this team completed , the authors concluded that requiring teams to make their knowledge structures transparent helped teams solidify their ideas about how their ideas were inter-related . The authors also suggested that requiring students to create concept maps of how their resources related to their central design concepts would have deepened students ' application of those resources . In debriefing their project , one student stated that it would have been beneficial if they had been required to use the wiki to rank the value of each source that they uploaded to the shared space . Nicol and colleagues ( 2005 ) last suggested that some information literacy skills do not come naturally to students and that building in mechanisms to the wiki to assist students through their problem solving is an important role for the instructor . <p> Phillipson and Hamilton ( 2004 ) reflected on a similar issue in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College , Brunswick , ME , exploring the Romantic poets . In this open-ended project , students analyzed and responded to poetry through annotating the original poems . Words and phrases were linked to pages of explication and reaction ; images related to poems were uploaded ; poems on similar themes were interlinked ; and biographical information was created about influential authors . In spite of students ' enthusiasm , there were difficulties . " Wikis lead to dispersion , " the authors stated . " It is easy to click around and wander off into paths that feel tangential or idiosyncratic . To a point , such an environment can feel liberating .. But disorientation is quickly frustrating , especially in a pedagogical setting . " <p> Phillipson and Hamilton chose a wiki software with navigation features that they thought would help their students . They took an active role in deciding which pages to highlight on the navigation bar , and they barred students from deleting each other 's posts . Once again , these instructors intervened in the operation of the wiki in response to their students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's middle school wiki project ( 2005 ) , in which students investigated the long-term consequences of six Missouri River dams , yielded similar conclusions in terms of the need to build in information literacy skills . Teachers realized on reflection that they needed to model and facilitate the exchange of ideas and that students needed some explicit instruction in the inquiry process to help them provide meaningful interactions with each other and the data they were uncovering . <p> As a matter of pedagogy , Richardson ( 2006 ) , James ( 2004 ) , and Lamb ( 2004 ) are correct to push for using wikis in the least restrictive environment , giving over control of content and process to students . But providing students with support , structure , and instruction when they lack the skills to assume complete control in no way undermines the effectiveness of the wiki as a tool . Richardson wrote that , in fact , the use of the wiki is as much about collaborative skills as it is about the production of content : <p> The collaborative environment that wikis facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how to create community , and how to operate in a world where the creation of knowledge and information is increasingly becoming a group effort . ( p. 74 ) <p> Let us take a closer look at five features of wikis that can make them an effective tool in facilitating such collaborative efforts , including examples from my partnerships with classroom teachers . <p> Feature 1 : Ease of use . Contributors simply go to a wiki site and add a new entry or edit an existing one following simple directions . Many wiki sites provide a " what you see is what you get " ( WNYSIWYG ) editing interface with options similar to those seen in a basic word-processing application , such as Microsoft Word . Users click on " Edit , " and add or change content , then click on " Save This Page . " That is all there is to it . Instant publishing . <p> Example . At the beginning of the school year , sophomore world studies students come to the library for a minilesson on determining the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classroom teacher , students generate a set of criteria that they will use to evaluate authority . Working in groups of three , students explore a single site and use the criteria to decide if the site is authoritative . Students record their answers on a wiki page that includes a link to the site . Because students have no difficulty learning to use the wiki after a 1-minute demonstration , they are able to record their answers and share with the whole group right away ( Figure 1 ) . <p> Feature 2 : Spaces for students to create products individually , in small groups , and as a whale group . Any wiki can be designed to contain separate work spaces for individual , small group , and large group products . The digital environment creates an easy means for students to move from one space to the next , taking notes , analyzing , and synthesizing information along the way . <p> Example . Students in a remedial science class are exploring the similarities and differences between human beings and other primates . Each student locates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own page provided by the teacher-librarian ( Figure 2 ) . The student records answers on that page . Then , a group leader copies all group members ' work into a matrix . Together , the group members answer the question , " Based on the data here , what does it mean to be human ? " ( Figure 3 ) . <p> Each group shares its data and answers with the class , comparing and refining answers . In a short period , students are able to collect , organize , and analyze a large amount of data to produce original conclusions and create authentic understanding . <p> Feature 3 : Ability to create a nonlinear document structure through hyperlinks . Hyperlinking allows for the creation of assignments whose steps need not be followed in a single order , offering flexibility and choice to students while maintaining clear paths to follow . Again , neither students nor instructors need to know any HTML coding to do this . <p> Example . Students move easily through all the information and work spaces of the primates wiki mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism for reflection and metacognition . As mentioned earlier , many wikis offer an option called " Discussion " -- some wiki sites call it " Comments " -- on which students can engage in conversation about the entry , explaining why they made changes , agreeing or disagreeing with what has been posted , and sharing personal feelings about a topic . <p> Example . Students work in pairs to explore both sides of a controversial issue before deciding which side to support . On Day 1 , one student researches the " pro " arguments while the other researches " con " arguments . The next day , students switch , completing the Day 2 chart by adding concrete details in support of the original arguments or by finding different arguments and support . Students then use the " Discussion " page to communicate with each other ( and to the teacher ) about which arguments and details are best and why . The teacher may participate in these discussions , too ( Figure 4 ) . <p> Feature 5 : A means of tracking individual , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wikis have a " History " option that allows users to view each change that has been made to an entry since its creation . This makes it possible for the teacher-librarian and classroom teacher to chart progress and identify places in the learning process that require more or less intervention -- a useful feedback tool in instructional design . <p> Example . In the " Writing a Persuasive Essay " assignment , each change to a page automatically creates a link on the " Versions " page -- sometimes called the " History " page ( Figure 5 ) . Some wiki software even allows you to compare new and old versions of a page side by side . This allows both student and teacher to chart progress through an assignment , and it provides opportunities for the teacher to intervene when necessary to keep collaboration on track . It also discourages vandalism because pages can easily be restored to an earlier version . <p> Each of the examples provides structure and support to meet students ' information literacy needs while honing collaboration skills . The collaborative context frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives , increased data points , and the heightened demands of clear communication among group members , among other factors . Wikis can help teachers and students negotiate that added dimension . PRIVACY AND SECURITY <p> Many educators have concerns about privacy and security in relation to wikis and other Web 2.0 applications . A single response to both is to install wiki software on a school 's server and run it inside the firewall . This way , unwanted intruders can neither view nor tamper with students ' work . This requires some technical expertise and , perhaps , a relationship with a school district 's network administrators -- something that is all too rare . There are free wiki sites , however , that can be set up with a password so that only invited guests may visit the site and participate in it . Other sites allow user groups in which only designated registered users gain access to the site . DELETING ONLINE PREDATORS ACT <p> Perhaps a greater obstacle is some districts ' refusal to allow any social software applications into its schools . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives ( H.R. 5319 , 2006 ) and currently before the U.S. Senate , would deny federal aid to any school library that did not block commercial social networking sites . Although the greatest fears center on MySpace and similar sites , the language of the Deleting Online Predators Act prohibits access to any commercial site that " enables communication among users , " a sledgehammer solution that actually denies students and educators some of the best new learning tools available . It is important that we as information specialists educate our school communities about the far-reaching ramifications of this proposed law . GETTING STARTED <p> If you are able to use wikis in your school setting , one final consideration is to choose the best wiki application for your needs . All of the following wiki sites offer free accounts with registration . Each also offers subscription accounts with more powerful options for the account holder . <p> Seedwiki ( www.seedwiki.com ) and Wikispaces ( www.wikispaces.com ) offer free wikis with WYSIWYG editors that make them the easiest to use . Seedwiki has a slightly more powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wikis in their free packages , so make certain that students do not include their full names or any personal information on the site . <p> PeanutButterWiki ( www.pbwiki.com ) and Schtuff ( www.schtuff.com ) are a bit more complicated to use , because they require some simple formatting . PeanutButterWiki allows for passwording of sites , affording teachers and class members some privacy when needed . For this reason , PeanutButterWiki is popular with school staff who are planning and drafting School business . Schtuff incorporates blogs into their spaces and allows changes in permission rights so that different users have different abilities to access or change documents . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : FIGURE 1 Example of Feature 1 : Ease of Use <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : FIGURE 2 Example of Feature 2 : Spaces for Students to Create Products <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : FIGURE 3 Example of Feature 3 : Ability to Create a Nonlinear Document <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : FIGURE 4 Example of Feature 4 : A Built-In Mechanism for Reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIGURE 5 Example of Feature 5 : A Means of Tracking Progress Through an Assignment <p>

@@4159041 Ehrlichia sp . DNA was amplified from 4 Ehrlichia-seroreactive horses from Mrida , Nicaragua . Sequencing of 16S rDNA , sodB , and groEL genes indicated that the bacterium is most likely a novel Ehrlichia species . The tick vector and the potential for canine and human infection remain unknown . # Worldwide , ehrlichioses are considered emerging infectious diseases of animals and humans . Transmitted by ticks , ehrlichae are obligate intracellular , gram-negative bacteria that infect animals and humans ( 1 ) . Recognized species include E. canis , E. chaffeensis , E. ewingii , E. muris , and E. ruminantium ( 1 ) . Other species identified in North America are Panola Mountain ( 2 ) and the E. muris-like agent ( 3 ) . Two recently identified new species are Ehrlichia sp . AvBat , isolated from Argas vespertilionis ticks in France ( 4 ) , and E. mineirensis , isolated from hemolymph of Rhipicephalus microplus ticks in Brazil ( 5 ) . # Although studies from Brazil and Oklahoma ( USA ) have documented reactivity to Ehrlichia spp. ( 6 , 7 ) in horse serum , no reports have documented isolation or PCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , cervids are reservoir hosts for E. chaffeensis , which after tick transmission causes monocytic ehrlichiosis in humans ( 1 ) . Although equids are not known hosts for E. chaffeensis , bacterial DNA has been amplified from ticks ( Dermacentor nitens and Amblyomma cajennense ) collected from horses in Panama ( 8 ) . Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi , causes of granulocytic anaplasmosis and borreliosis ( Lyme disease ) , respectively , are transmitted by Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus ticks in North America and infect cats , dogs , horses , and humans . # In Mrida , Nicaragua , the potential for infection of horses by tickborne pathogens is a concern because of the horses ' often poor body condition and heavy tick infestations . In 2013 , to determine exposure of equids to &gt;1 tickborne organism , visiting veterinary students collected blood samples from horses . # The Study # With approval from the Oregon State University Animal Care and Use Committee ( Animal Care and Use Proposal no. 4329 ) , blood samples were collected from 92 horses being evaluated for medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , administration of endoparasiticides and ectoparasiticides ) or before elective surgery ( e.g. , castration , wound repair ) at the clinic in Mrida from August 28 through September 4 , 2013 . After jugular venipuncture , 6 mL of blood was collected into EDTA tubes . # Each whole blood sample was tested for antibodies against Anaplasma spp . ( A. phagocytophilum and A. platys ) , B. burgdorferi sensu stricto , and Ehrlichia spp . ( E.canis , E. chaffeensis , and E. ewingii ) by using the ELISA-based assay SNAP 4DxPlus ( IDEXX Laboratories , Inc. , Westbrook , ME , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( 9 ) . The assay does not use a host species-specific conjugate and can therefore be used in research to screen mammals other than dogs . According to assay results , 51 ( 55% ) horse serum samples were Ehrlichia spp. seroreactive . One sample was B. burgdorferi seroreactive , whereas none were Anaplasma spp. seroreactive. # The 51 Ehrlichia spp. -reactive serum samples were subsequently stored at 28C for up to 1 week during transport to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipped ( US Department of Agriculture import permit no. 13846 ) to the Intracellular Pathogens Research Laboratory , Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research , North Carolina State University , College of Veterinary Medicine . DNA extraction from 200 mL of EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood was performed by using a QIAsymphony DNA Mini Kit ( QIAGEN , Valencia , CA , USA ; catalog no. 931236 ) . Previously described PCRs were used to amplify a 420-bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene , a 620-bp fragment of the GroEL gene , and a 300-bp fragment of the Ehrlichia spp. sodB gene ( 2 , 10 , 11 ) . A larger , 600-bp , fragment of the sodB gene was amplified from 1 sample that was positive by PCR by using the following unpublished primers : sodbEhrl600-F 5 ' **32;16193;TOOLONG and sodbEhrl600-R 5 ' **29;16227;TOOLONG . Positive ( Anaplasma or Ehrlichia spp. plasmid DNA ) and negative ( RNase-free molecular-grade water and a DNA extraction control consisting of uninfected canine genomic DNA ) controls were used for each assay . Amplified DNA was sequenced directly by GENEWIZ , Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and alignments were compared with those of GenBank sequences by using AlignX software ( Vector NTI Advance version 11.5 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . # Of the 51 samples tested by 16S rDNA PCR , the rDNA amplicon sequences were identical for 4 ( 8% ) . Sequence comparisons of the amplified products with Ehrlichia spp. , Anaplasma spp. , and Neorickettsia risticii sequences in GenBank are summarized in the Table . Identical GroEL and sodB DNA sequences were amplified from 3 of 4 horses . # Conclusions # According to serologic , PCR amplification , and DNA sequencing results , tick-infested horses in Mrida , Nicaragua , might be infected with a potentially novel Ehrlichia species . Initial serologic screening with the rapid ELISA indicated that exposure to ? 1 Ehrlichia species is common among horses in Nicaragua ( 55% ) . For dogs , SNAP 4Dx-Plus results can be positive after exposure to E. canis , E. chaffeensis , E. ewingii , and potentially E. muris and Panola Mountain ehrlichiae ( 2 , 3 , 6 ) . Before this study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in Nicaragua was considered more likely because equine exposure has occurred in Guatemala ; this rickettsial organism is pathogenic for cats , dogs , horses , and humans ( 12 ) . However , in North America , A. phagocytophilum is transmitted by I. scapularis and I. pacificus ticks , which have not been reported in Nicaragua . In future studies of horses in Nicaragua , ticks will be collected for identification . In Guatemala , R. microplus and A. cajennense ticks were the predominant species found on cattle , whereas D. nitens and A. cajennense ticks were most commonly found on horses ( 12 ) . Of note , in Guatemala , tick infestation levels were substantially higher and body condition scores lower for horses than for cattle . Also , cattle were exposed to an agent with serologic cross-reactivity and close genetic relatedness to E. ruminantium. # The partial 16S rDNA sequences obtained from these horses most likely represent a novel species of Ehrlichia . This conclusion is further supported by sequence analysis of 2 protein-coding genes , sodB and groEL . Partial sequences from sodB and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GenBank , but they were not 100% identical to any sequences deposited to date . When 16S rDNA for rickettsiae are compared , Fournier et al . recommend that gene homology for organisms of identical species and genus be 99.8% and 98.1% , respectively ( 13 ) . Although identical species are typically defined as being &gt;99% identical with a reference sequence , the percentage identity needed to define a separate species is debated , ranging from 97% to 99.5% ( 14 ) . Calculation of values can be based on alignment methods , reference databases , and number of basepairs in the sequence . Fournier et al . recommend that for novel species identification and rickettsiae classification , protein-coding genes should be used , specifically the 4 protein-coding genes gltA , ompA , ompB , and gene D in addition to the 16S rRNA gene . To date , 16S rDNA sequences or whole-genome sequencing have been used to classify Ehrlichia species and strains . Collectively , and as depicted in the Figure ( in which phylogenetic alignment trees for all 3 genes tested in this study were constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anaplasma , Ehrlichia , and Neorickettsia ) , the genetic findings in this study support infection of horses in Nicaragua with a novel Ehrlichia species . To confirm this possibility , future efforts will focus on cell culture isolation of the Ehrlichia organism from horses in Nicaragua . # Vectorborne pathogens can infect any host species bitten by infected ticks . At least 4 Ehrlichia species have been implicated as being pathogenic for canids and humans ( 1-3 ) . Thus , future studies should also determine whether dogs , other animals , and humans in Nicaragua are exposed to and infected with this potentially novel Ehrlichia species . # Acknowledgments # We thank the Department of Biomedical Sciences , Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine , for funding this study ; the veterinary students who participated in the 2013 Nicaragua trip and helped collect the blood samples used for this study ; and Dana Riggins for technical assistance in processing samples for PCR. # This research was supported in part by the State of North Carolina and donations to the North Carolina State University College of Medicine Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laboratories Inc. # Ms. O'Nion is a student in the veterinary medical curriculum at Oregon State University .

@@4004341 Anthropologists inspired by the works of Michel Foucault have described development as a discourse imposed on the Third World by powerful western institutions . In defining the power of such agencies ( especially the World Bank ) these authors focus not on the practices of actors or sets of actors , but rather on the ability of such institutions to shape perceptions of Third World peoples and to limit ways of thinking about the world and imagining change . While the focus on language is helpful to understanding how development agendas are " deployed " throughout the world , many critics overlook the important role of local elite groups as well as the agency of development 's " target populations . " The uses of , and popular responses to , " sustainable development " and other development strategies in Bogot , Colombia , show that the development discourse is neither so monolithic nor so hegemonic as some critics suggest . Because of sustainable development 's vague mandate and imprecise terminology , it has been easily manipulated and rewritten at the local level . <p> Keywords : development ; environment ; agency ; poststructuralism ; Latin America <p> Recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important task of unraveling development practice and malpractice from Bretton Woods to present-day interventions including " Women In Development , " " Sustainable Development , " and " Participatory Planning . " ( n1 ) These critics describe development as a powerful discourse , or as a " regime of representation , " which imposes itself on Third World peoples . This discourse facilitates not only the governance and control of the " Third World " by " the West , " but also imposes a hegemonic view of reality which defines non-western peoples as underdeveloped . The consequence of this discourse for those who are its target , critics say , is the perpetuation and expansion of global inequalities , and the " disqualification of non-Western knowledge systems " ( Escobar 1995a : 13 ) . In other words , development , as both an idea and a set of practices , has become so pervasive and so powerful , that it is increasingly difficult to imagine alternatives that are outside of the development framework . <p> Such critiques have shown the ways in which the development community shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of its own stated objectives . Yet these critiques lack , to varying degrees , a meaningful sense of agency or process . We still know very little about who the practitioners of development are , and how policies are shaped by struggles and conflicts within and between institutions . For some , resistance on the part of development 's subjects is a way out of the development " nightmare . " Yet , in-depth discussions of how target groups have resisted and reshaped development programs to date are lacking in such critiques . In fact , arguments of poststructural or postmodern critics of development , share many of the weaknesses of those of their Marxist predecessors , in that they tend to portray " subject peoples " as incapable ( or nearly so ) of autonomous intellectual thought ( reminiscent of the " false consciousness " concerns of some Marxists ) , and especially in that they tend to ignore the important role of local and national elite groups in importing and redefining " western " development strategies. ( n2 ) <p> A look at the uses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors ( planners , environmentalists , politicians , neighborhood residents , activists ) are conscious participants in the development encounter . While the poststructuralist critique of the teleological Marxist analyses of development in the 1970s is a useful step in recognizing the unintended consequences of development , I do not agree with the view of development as a " subject-less " process . This decentered approach to development ( most notable in the works of Ferguson 1990 and Escobar 1995a , discussed below ) is based on the assertion that events unfold not by the will of knowing subjects , but rather " behind the backs of or against the wills of even the most powerful actors " ( Ferguson 1990 : 18 ) . Though many of development 's effects may indeed be unintended by the actors involved , I do not see this as a justification for leaving agency out of accounts of development.

( n4 ) While elites import and adapt the sustainable development discourse in an effort to win foreign funding and disguise political and economic interests , the resistance of residents of the eastern barrios to these and other projects has limited the ability of elites , both inside and outside of government , to implement their projects . Moreover , residents rarely buy into the vision of reality presented by developers , planners , and politicians . <p> Deconstructing Development <p> In 1969 Dell Hymes challenged anthropologists to take a stand against post-World War II development schemes and the evolutionary models on which they were based . According to Hymes , anthropology had not been critical of the way Third World societies were described in public policy and social science debates . Hymes argued : <p> The common coin has been " developed " vs. " underdeveloped , " or " modern " vs. " traditional . " I submit that these are equivalents to the " civilized " and " primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , combined often enough with the notion of a center of diffusion to less fortunate peoples .. Why is it that anthropologists , so well equipped to expose the error of such thinking in Englishmen and Marxists , have been so little heard from as such thinking proliferated all about them ? ( 1969 : 28-29 ) . <p> In the 1970s and 1980s many did challenge development practices . A number of anthropologists criticized economic models which presumed the goal of capitalist development for failing to take into account local social , cultural , and ecological factors ( Little and Painter 1995 : 602 ; for example , see Polly Hill 's ( 1986 ) Development anthropology on trial ) . With the influence of dependency theory ( Frank 1972 ) and world systems theory ( Wallerstein 1974 ) , scholars were encouraged to view development in the context of center-periphery relations and the expansion of world capitalism . Marxist critiques , such as Cheryl Payer 's indictment of the World Bank ( 1982 ) and Rosemary Galli 's work on rural development ( 1981 ) , viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Chilcote and Joel Edelstein 's ( 1974 ) work , Latin America : The struggle with dependency , argued that " dependent capitalism " was responsible for the region 's state of underdevelopment . Similarly , Lappe and Collins ' widely read Food first ( 1977 ) and ( with Kinley , 1980 ) Aid as obstacle argued that development projects could do nothing to eradicate poverty when they reinforced the structures of inequality that were responsible for such poverty . Hunger was not a product of global scarcity , overpopulation , and diminishing resources , but rather a product of the capitalist system and unequal distribution . These critiques inspired many anthropologists to broaden the challenge to developmentalist thinking. ( n5 ) <p> A new generation of development critics , inspired by the works of Michel Foucault and post-structuralist analysis , has emerged in the past decade , whose critiques focus on development institutions and their discourses . These works reflect a clear influence of the Marxist critiques of development , but poststructuralists choose to evaluate development in discursive , rather than materialist , terms . Geoff Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and argues that the target-group terminology of multi-national institutions helps to legitimate development interventions . According to Wood , such interventions do not so much improve the conditions of the poor as create a kind of underdevelopment which is both politically and technically manageable . Similarly , Escobar argues that development derives its power in part by creating " visibilities , " that is , by making " target groups " visible as problems to be solved and acted on ( 1995a , chapter 5 ) . ( n6 ) In Dahl and Rabo 's edited volume Kam-ap or take-off ( 1992 ) , the contributors explore how the targets of development respond to the kind of labeling described by Wood , and how local visions of development intersect with or diverge from the premises of western development . Stacy Leigh Pigg ( 1992 ) explores the social construction of the Nepalese village through development schemes and discourses . Similar to Dahl and Rabo , she asks " how , precisely , an ideology of modernization becomes assimilated into local culture " ( 1992 : 492 ) . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a rhetorical tool , and they recognize a variety of " positional perspectives on development " ( 1984 : 176-177 ) . However , none of these authors , with the exception of Pigg , looks at how perspectives on development , especially at the local level , are shaped by class interests , nor do they focus on national elite groups and their interests in importing development schemes. ( n7 ) <p> In The development dictionary ( 1992 ) , a polemical volume edited by Wolfgang Sachs , the contributors try to construct an " archaeology " of central development concepts. ( n8 ) Sachs sets the tone for an all-out rebuttal of the notion of " development " : <p> Though doubts are mounting and uneasiness is widely felt , development talk still pervades not only official declarations but even the language of grassroots movements . It is time to dismantle this mental structure . The authors of this book consciously bid farewell to the defunct idea in order to clear our minds for fresh discoveries ( 1992a : 1 ) . <p> Two recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development apparatus . " James Ferguson ( 19941990 ) and Arturo Escobar ( 1995a ) expose how the World Bank constructs knowledge about the Third World by examining World Bank projects in Lesotho and Colombia , respectively. ( n9 ) While the two studies differ significantly , they both share a view of development as a powerful discourse . <p> According to Escobar , by the 1970s the development apparatus had become hegemonic as an ideal as well as a set of practices . He argues , <p> This apparatus came into existence roughly in the period 1945 to 1955 and has not since ceased to produce new arrangements of knowledge and power , new practices , theories , strategies , and so on . In sum , it has successfully deployed a regime of government over the Third World , a space for " subject peoples " that ensures certain control over it ( 1995a : 9 , emphasis added ) . <p> Escobar 's goal is to show how the " hegemonic worldview of development " operates to exclude alternatives while making it difficult , if not impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine the world in other terms . <p> Escobar is careful to say that his critique of development does not imply a conspiracy on the part of planners and policy-makers , yet many of his statements suggest otherwise . For example , he says of failed food and nutrition programs that , <p> One begins to suspect that what is at stake is not really the eradication of hunger ( even if the planners wholeheartedly desired so ) but its multiplication and dispersion into an even finer web , a play of mobile visibilities which is hard to hold in one 's sight ( 1995a : 117 ) . <p> Sachs makes an even more emphatic declaration of the development agenda : " From the start development 's hidden agenda was nothing else than the Westernization of the world " ( 1992a : 3-4 ) . After decades of muddled attempts at development , these critics suggest that while the development establishment most often failed in its stated objectives , it has accomplished a progressive standardization , and management , of the world . <p> Escobar does not view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin the development discourse on any particular set or sets of actors , either in the World Bank , the planning offices in Bogot , or the field stations of rural Colombia . Apparently the agent of this homogenization is the discourse itself , and its uniformity stretches across both time ( from World War II to the present ) and space ( throughout the Third World ) . ( n10 ) While related to the poststructural notion of a subject-less history , it is also reminiscent of structural Marxist critiques of the 1970s , in which the agent of change and domination was " capital " rather than " discourse . " ( n11 ) We are left wondering where this discourse comes from and how it might be shaped by the struggles of real people . Moreover , by reducing development to discourses rather than historical processes animated by conscious actors we may miss many of the causes and consequences of poverty , violence , and inequality ( Little and Painter 1995 : 605 ) . <p> Escobar 's focus is institutions , not people , in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little in the way of a " thick description " of how agencies like the World Bank really work , how policies are shaped and reshaped by internal struggles and conflicts . Similarly , the Colombian planners are portrayed in two dimensions as well-intentioned but misguided , the hapless pawns of the Bank : <p> One would hate to think that the hard and competent work of the Colombian planners served as ( one more ) subsidy for the World Bank , an additional mechanism through which this institution dispersed its blueprint and accumulated symbolic capital , but some of this clearly happened ( 1995a : 147 ) . <p> To the extent that local and national actors are visible in Escobar 's account , they are depicted as totally constrained by the World Bank , unable to maneuver within the " development regime . " One of the most notable oversights of Escobar 's analysis , as well as the Sachs edited volume , is that he completely ignores the role of local and national elite groups , as well as the state , in importing and implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international development strategies not ( only ) because they have internalized a foreign model of development , but because it serves their own interests . This contention will be amplified in the discussion of sustainable development below . <p> For both Escobar and Ferguson , resistance is both a means for achieving alternatives to development , as well as a way in which anthropologists can play a positive role in the development encounter . For Escobar , resistance , and the failure of development efforts , will lead to the " unmaking " of the Third World and the opening of spaces for " alternative production strategies . " ( n12 ) In this view , resistance is primarily a way to construct new identities necessary for finding alternatives to the hegemonic worldview presented by the development discourse . Yet resistance is also , and more importantly for local peoples , about protecting land and houses from expropriation , and about demanding a fair share of development benefits in the form of education and services . Neither author discusses resistance in depth , nor do he explain how resistance can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to imagine resistance in light of the ideological strangle-hold that the development discourse appears to have in poststructural accounts . Yet I agree with Scott that , " Although the ideological position of the wealthy is rarely challenged in public , we know from unguarded derisive commentary by the poor that they hardly find it convincing -- let alone hegemonic " ( 1985 : 310 ) . In poststructural accounts of development , resistance therefore comes across as a utopian afterthought , rather than a real opportunity to shape social processes . <p> Ferguson does show the real effects of rural development initiatives in Lesotho . He also provides an insightful discussion of how the Thaba-Tseka Development Project was altered and manipulated by local actors , especially provincial bureaucrats . Yet like other development critics , his focus remains the World Bank as an institution and on the development discourse . Ferguson shows how Lesotho is constructed by the development agency as an underdeveloped nation : <p> Lesotho can be represented in " development " discourse as a nation of farmers , not wage laborers ; a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no classes ; values , but no structures ; administrators , but no ruler ; bureaucracy , but no politics ( 1994 : 66 ) . <p> Ferguson argues that " developers " seek to depoliticize the nature and consequences of their projects . As a result , development projects facilitate the extension of state power into previously autonomous regions of Lesotho . Without discussing resistance , however , Ferguson leaves the impression that this attempt to conceal the political realities of development goes unchallenged by local populations . I argue that it is not through mystifying development as a science that power is achieved , but rather through the implementation of projects that suit the interests of state or local actors , and through the resistance to such projects on the part of the target groups . In other words , those who push for development programs and strategies ( especially national elites ) may seek to present them as neutral , scientific , and outside of political conflicts , but few people will actually perceive them as such . <p> Crush 's edited volume Power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and , similar to Escobar ( who contributes to the volume ) , Sachs et al. , and Ferguson , it focuses on language and discourse . However , the volume is also a valuable contribution to the growing body of Foucault-inspired analyses because it shows the considerable variation and disagreements within post-structuralist perspectives . The contributions of Cowen and Shenton , and Watts , are particularly significant because they historicize development , tracing the concept back at least to nineteenth-century positivists and eighteenth-century colonialists . They offer an appropriate corrective to Escobar ( 1995a ) and Sachs ( 1992a ) , who imply that President Truman invented the idea in the Post-WWII years ( Watts 1995 : 51 ) . Many of the contributors also go further than other poststructuralists in bridging local and international contexts . On the whole , however , there is still too little sense of what development targets have to say . <p> Neither the activists nor the residents of eastern Bogot were fooled by the obvious attempts to deny the political and economic interests behind a series of development initiatives from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worldview that presumed the standards set by the World Bank . It is hard to believe that people in Lesotho were any more disposed to view themselves as the Bank did . Elites in Bogot work as hard as they do to deny the politics behind their versions of sustainable development , for example , precisely because past experience has taught them how quickly political conflicts and social movements can entangle their programs and derail the entire process . In an effort to show how development works as a discourse that shapes limited alternatives , critics have presented a one-sided view of power and hegemony , while understating and/or romanticizing the role of local and national actors . In such a view , the local is overwhelmed by distant institutions and their discourses and any sense of the dialectical relationship between local and extra-local forces is lost . In the case of sustainable development , however , we can see that the language of environmental sustainability is no longer controlled merely by the World Commission on Development and Environment , but rather is being continually appropriated and transformed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development " <p> Since the World Commission on Environment and Development issued the Bruntland Report in 1987 , sustainable development has been on the lips of policy makers and planners throughout the developed and developing worlds . According to the commission , this new strategy , " seeks to meet the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability to meet those of the future " ( World Commission on Development and Environment 1987 : 40 ) . Sustainable development , then , promises to manage the environment and sustain growth , as the two goals must now be reconciled : " Development can not subsist upon a deteriorating environmental resource base ; the environment can not be protected when growth leaves out of account the costs of environmental destruction " ( 1987 : 37 ) . ( n14 ) <p> Economic growth and ecology must be linked in development thinking , not only because resources must be maintained for future generations , but also because policy makers blame poverty for much environmental degradation . By eliminating poverty through economic growth , then , environmental destruction will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of Third World cities : <p> Few city governments in the developing world have the power , resources , and trained staff to provide their rapidly growing populations with the land , services , and facilities needed for an adequate human life : clean water , sanitation , schools , and transport . The result is mushrooming illegal settlements with primitive facilities , increasing overcrowding , and rampant disease linked to an unhealthy environment ( 1987 : 238 ) . ( n15 ) <p> While suggesting that sustainable development will promote social equity , there is also a subtle message in the sustainable development discourse that poverty , and the poor , are to blame for much environmental degradation . This is especially true , and not particularly subtle , in the case of the urban poor , and seems to have gone remarkably unchallenged by advocates of sustainable development ( see , for example , Haughton and Hunter 1994 : 17 , 26 ) . This assessment of blame would be amplified by urban elites in Colombia who charge the poor with the loss of the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that the tom to environment is simply the latest attempt to sustain growth and manage the Third World . Wolfgang Sachs asserts that , <p> While environment was originally advanced to put development polities under indictment , it is now raised like a banner to announce a new era of development . Indeed , after " ignorance " and " poverty " in previous decades , " survival of the planet " is likely to become that well publicized emergency of the 1990s , in whose name a new frenzy of development will be unleashed ( 1992a : 26 ; see also Sachs 1993 ) . <p> Similarly , Escobar perceptively points out that , " It is growth ( read : capitalist market expansion ) , and not the environment , that has to be sustained " ( 1995a : 196 ) . For Escobar , little has changed at the level of discourse , and sustainable development is just a new way of maintaining the development regime : <p> It is still assumed that the benevolent ( white ) hand of the West will save the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank , mediated by Gro Harlem Bruntland , the matriarch scientist , and a few cosmopolitan Third Worlders who made it to the World Commission , to reconcile " humankind " with " nature . " The Western scientist continues to speak for the Earth . God forbid that a Peruvian peasant , an African nomad , or a rubber tapper of the Amazons should have something to say in this regard ( 1995a : 193-194 ) . <p> For Escobar , sustainable development is simply the continuation of the West 's efforts to rationalize , control , and manage the Third World . In this argument , women , peasants , and non-whites are excluded as agents of change , and the West is a monolith of white men , along with a few marginalized tokens of diversity . This is a compelling argument , but it obscures the complexity of the development encounter and portrays " subject peoples " as powerless and voiceless . This will be explored through a brief discussion of the use of sustainable development in Bogot . <p> Sustainable Development in Bogot <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long been a symbol of the city and its standard postcard image . As the city spread north and west in this century , the large estates of the sabana ( high plain ) were sold to developers . The workers on those estates were left to live in the eastern hills , which were considered worthless to developers because of their inaccessibility and the difficulty of bringing services to the higher elevations . Others arrived in the eastern barrios over the years , mostly coming from the Boyaca region . <p> Though there are many differences between neighborhoods , principally in terms of their history and legal status , the barrios share the characteristics of do-it-yourself housing , inadequate services , and gradual improvement of both through the formation of neighborhood committees. ( n16 ) Since the 1970s and 1980s when a major road was constructed through the area , the cerros orientales ( eastern hills ) have been the focus of intense competition on the part of land speculators , urban planners , politicians , and the workers who had made the hills their home . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal settlements " of the eastern hills , lie some of the city 's wealthiest residential neighborhoods , home to influential business leaders , senators , and ex-presidents . These wealthy residents fear their neighbors and view the neighborhoods in the hills as chaotic , an embarrassing sign of the country 's underdevelopment . <p> Residents living in these neighborhoods , which appear to cling to the hillsides of eastern Bogot , view the area quite differently . They see their neighborhoods as the product of long years of struggle , community effort , organized resistance , and sacrifice . Residents of El Paraso , a legally settled neighborhood of do-it-yourself housing which has struggled for years to get basic services such as electricity , water , and paved roads from the government , are fond of saying that their barrio should be called El Infierno ( " hell , " rather than " paradise " ) because of the sacrifices they have made to settle the area . When the city government has failed to provide services , residents have taken the initiative themselves , installing an aqueduct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tapping into nearby power lines . Young men have been electrocuted in the process of tapping these lines , and to the barrios they are martyrs , not thieves . <p> The pride that residents take in their neighborhoods is bittersweet , because they are pressured to move out of the area , especially those without legal rifle , and because they are constantly being told by the government and media that they are temporary , worthless , and even invisible . In the technical , and apparently neutral , language of government planning , the eastern barrios are variously described as " clandestine , " " sub-normal , " or " spontaneous . " Nothing of the long years of tenure and work improving the settlements is acknowledged in such accounts and residents resent such portrayals . As a result of such denials of the legitimacy of the eastern barrios , residents live in a state of perpetual limbo and uncertainty . In such situations it becomes difficult for residents to move forward , plan for the future , and build more permanent ( brick ) housing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and contradictory concept , its manifestations in Bogot are even less precise. ( n17 ) Terms such as " sustainable development , " " biodiversity , " and " participatory planning " are thrown about in discussions with planners and civic leaders as if their meaning were clear and uncontested . In such conversations proponents of projects that are labeled " sustainable " gloss over the contradictions of urban inequalities and conflicting interests ( see Redclift and Goodman 1991 : 4-6 ; see also Redclift 1987 ) . Sustainable development has allowed private interest groups and policy makers alike the opportunity to imagine a way to preserve the beauty of the eastern hills , while allowing for " selective development " ( apartments for the wealthy surrounded by urban parks ) and eliminating the settlements which are viewed as the refuge of the dangerous classes. ( n18 ) Urban elites have imported and rewritten the language of sustainable development and participatory planning for their own purposes , while local residents in the hills have blocked attempts to exclude them from the planning process or expropriate their homes. ( n19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have begun to draw up sustainable development plans for the eastern hills . The Corporacin de los Cerros , or the Corporation for the Hills , is one such initiative . The Corporation is a private interest group , made up of prominent residents of the posh northeast , which hopes to limit urbanization in the hills by purchasing land in the area and creating an " ecological park . " Since 1993 the Corporation has sought foreign funding from European organizations including the Metropolis Foundation , a French organization interested in urban environmental management . The organizers ' ability to attract funding rests on their assertion that the mountains are an ecologically unique area and important to the physical well-being of the city . In a 1993 interview Corporation Director Patricia Tones told me , " The only reason that we are not going to become a Mexico City so quickly is that we have this lung , the hills . We have that gold mine there beside such a monster of a city . " <p> The most ambitious project to date to limit growth in the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly created local planning board for the district of Chapinero , or the JAL ( Junta Administradora Local ) . The Plan for the Physical Regulation of the Eastern Zone ( Plan de Ordenamiento Fisico Para la Zona Oriental ) is an attempt to reduce the size of low-income or " subnormal " settlements in the hills and regulate future development through zoning , favoring low-density housing ( inevitably , for the wealthy ) and protected forest reserves in areas of " unstable terrain . " ( n20 ) The JAL was created as a result of the 1991 Colombian Constitution , which mandated decentralization and local participation in planning decisions . <p> Most voters in the Chapinero district of Bogot are upper-middle class and wealthy residents , and the representatives they elected to the local planning board reflect that fact. ( n21 ) While the board members come from the wealthiest sections of Chapinero , their fast project targeted what they considered to be Chapinero 's urban blight , the eastern hills . The plan , and its advocates , evoke images of the mountains as the " lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantra that the Amazon is the " lungs of the world , " in order to support their claims on the future development of the area. ( n22 ) Such language allows urban environmental problems to be conceptually tied to global sustainability. ( n23 ) I agree with postructuralists that this rhetoric allows for interventions and denies political interests ( see Sachs 1992b ) . I disagree , however , with the assumption that this intervention is generated primarily at the international level . Poststructuralists tend to ignore the fact that the discourse gets coopted and reworked by local actors with their own interests . As even the proponents of sustainable development admit , the term is vague and easily manipulated as a " political mantra " ( Haughton and Hunter 1994 : 21 ; see also Bartelmus 1994 : 69 ) . <p> Despite the mandate of broad participation , the JAL board has made little effort to include the concerns of residents who would be most affected by the initiative . This has not stopped the JAL from making claims of inclusion in their planning reports in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the city administration . <p> Tree Saplings Wrapped in Dollar Bills : The JAL Plan <p> The cover of the Phase Two report of the JAL Plan is astonishing in its blatant recognition of the symbolic capital of appeals to environmental sustainability . The cover includes a picture of tree saplings wrapped in US dollar bills . This recognition of the power of environmental claims on the part of planners is matched by their appreciation for the value of the eastern hills as real estate . Throughout the JAL project documents , there is the sense that the potential of the land in the hills over Chapinero is not being fully realized . The planners suggest that with the " consolidation " of the existing poor barrios , new lands can be opened to development. ( n24 ) According to the Phase One study , over half of the land ( 55 percent ) is heavily forested and too steep for development , making it a kind of de facto forest reserve . Over half of the land suitable for construction is still open to future development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the area and defining its future growth . As one of the JAL board members ( ediles ) , Jaime Concha , told me in a 1993 interview , <p> I think it is an extremely valuable area . Only 30 percent of it is invasion , let 's say , or low-income barrios . So therefore , the remaining 70 percent can be organized , and you can do something logical with it . <p> In a letter from Jaime Concha and another board member , Jose Felix Estrada , to the Director of Planning for the city of Bogot , the assertion that zoning in the hills will benefit the health of the entire city is reiterated : " We believe that the area can still be saved for the future of the city . " <p> The goal of the JAL plan , stated in the Phase I report , is " the incorporation of an area of excellent location and enormous potential into the development of the district of Chapinero " ( JAL 1993a : no page numbers ) . The report goes on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area to the preservation of natural resources in the area , especially the preservation of important water sources and forested areas . The contradiction between these two goals , as well as the contradicting class interests in the area , are not addressed . The project report recommends a mixture of conservation of some areas with a " selective development " of other lands . The Phase II report calls this option " sustained development . " While it is politically impossible to remove squatters or low-income settlements from the area by force , the report reasons , market forces themselves will lead to a " consolidation " ( that is , reduction ) of poor neighborhoods in the area . The low population density that proponents say wealthy housing and careful zoning will achieve is the key to their claims of the project 's environmental sustainability . <p> The need for logical , rational planning , and a sense of order , are themes that run through both the JAL documents , as well as interviews I conducted in 1993 with those involved in the plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " recovered " or integrated into the development of the city and of the district of Chapinero . Why is the idea of recovering the hills so important ? Precisely because the local elite feels that it has lost control of the area , which it now recognizes to be of great value . Luis Fernando Castro , district president ( Alcalde Menor ) of Chapinero , clearly states that the goal of the plan was " the recovery recuperacin of the area . " ( n25 ) When I asked what he meant by " recuperacin , " he said , <p> When you go by there you can visually see the chaos . So , " recuperar " means to organize , to take away the chaos , so that it functions as it should socially , and that it has at least the minimum conditions . <p> Castro and others view the neighborhoods seen from the highway as chaotic and out of place in the posh northeast . <p> Elvira Cuervo de Jaramillo , the director of the private organization that was hired to draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recuperar in the development report in terms of ecological preservation : " To replant , to clean . that is what ' recuperar ' means , in environmental terms . When you see that an area has been pillaged , you have to return it to the service of the community . " Despite the neutral language of improved living conditions and environmental preservation , the use of the term " recuperar " ( to recover ) also suggests the desire to take control of an area that has fallen into disarray and chaos by the spread of unchecked " slums . " Moreover , no plans for regeneration of native species or reforestation is included in the report ( see below ) . As the use of the term " recuperar " suggests , the report reflects the assumption that poor barrios are bad for the environment , and that the mountains are too valuable to allow them to be taken over by slums . For example , the Phase Two report states : <p> The areas of clandestine settlements are highly consolidated , have the necessary legal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an urban and socio-economic phenomenon that causes similar settlements to develop on surrounding lands , with the obvious risks of environmental deterioration and degradation for the area emphasis added. ( n26 ) <p> The assumption that " clandestine " settlements are inherently bad for the environment masks a more complex set of factors . The settlement of the hills has caused a great deal of soil erosion and contamination of streams . However , what the plan fails to point out is that paved roads , proper drainage systems , and regular garbage service in the barrios could go a long way toward solving these problems . Moreover , the massive construction projects for luxury housing , and the highways and pollution brought by that development , have a far greater environmental impact. ( n27 ) Nonetheless , the reports reflect an underlying assumption that wealthy settlements despite their greater per capita consumption of resources , are more " eco-friendly . " Ecology , presumed geological risks , and market forces offer three possibilities for the " consolidation " of the existing settlements in the hills , and three potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> District and city government efforts to control the growth of the eastern hills seems to rest largely on their assertion that the mountains are an ecologically unique area and important to the physical well-being of the city . For example , Elizabeth Rodado , the director of the city government environmental office refers to the hills as the " lungs of Bogot . " Why are the mountains the lungs of Bogot ? According to Rodado , <p> The fast thing is that the quality of life will deteriorate if we do n't have the eastern hills . The second reason is that there is definitely an important wealth of bio-diversity , in pramo , in flora , in fauna. ( n28 ) <p> Like the description of the mountains as the lungs of the city , the emphasis on the area 's biodiversity is both strategic and misleading . In fact , the eastern hills were completely deforested by the late nineteenth century ( Carrizosa Umaa 1989 ) . The forests in the hills today are second growth , and primarily non-native species , such as pine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topography of the area . <p> Like Rodriguez Azuero , who admits that the effects of the JAL plan on the residents of the hills is likely to be unfortunate , Rodado argues that the prevention of future poor settlements in the hills is crucial to preserving the ecology of the area for the benefit of all Bogotanos . Rodado describes the settlements in the eastern hills , echoing the stereotypes that middle-class and wealthy Bogotanos hold about the eastern barrios : <p> What we see in the hills are quarries , areas of deforestation , areas where people are robbed , where you ca n't go for a walk because they will attack you , where who knows how many people have been killed , on the highway alone . But this is all because there is not management and control , and because people do n't realize the importance of the hills. ( n29 ) <p> Interspersed with her commentary on the ecological aspects of the area , Rodado 's comments reveal the fear of many elites living in the north -- that " dangerous " neighborhoods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refuge of thieves and outlaws : <p> If we let the squatter settlements advance and continue as they are , we are obviously going to have a terrible problem for the city , because we are going to have a Ciudad Bolvar on the eastern side of Bogot , completely eroded , where the topsoil is very fragile , as fragile as an eggshell. ( n30 ) <p> Such statements reflect the fear of massive slums in the backyard of the city 's rich and powerful which underlies apparently neutral discussions of soil erosion and environmental degradation . <p> ' A No Dejarnos Fregar ' : Popular Responses to Development , 1972-1994 <p> The JAL plan appropriates the language of popular development trends -- sustainable development , community participation -- to drum up support and funding for their project . However , organizers are vague about what they understand these concepts to mean , especially in reference to the eastern hills and what they want to do there . Behind the references to such trends are more deep-rooted assumptions about the nature of development , the place of poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While projects promising eco-parks and sustainable development may play well to international and national agencies and lend legitimacy to the efforts of elites to force the poor from the eastern hills , local residents find such language a thin mask which disguises little . Because the plan is still in the early stages , the full response on the part of the eastern barrios is not yet known . However , the response thus far and the response to other development initiatives in the area in past years suggests that the barrios will organize to force the organizations involved to recognize their interests . <p> The residents of the eastern hills have engaged in a long history of resisting and redirecting development efforts in the area . In the early 1970s a highway project through the eastern hills , the grand Avenida de los Cerros , funded in part by the Inter-American Development Bank , threatened to force low-income residents out of the area through proposed expropriations and a flurry of land speculation ( see Gilbert 1978 ; Everett 1995 ) . The plan was touted by the mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the east of the highway from future development . It was clear to the residents of the eastern barrios that the road would provide a link between the burgeoning wealthy suburbs to the north of the city and the downtown government and business districts . It was also clear to residents that the road implied the expropriation and eviction of hundreds of families , many of whom had no legal title to their land . <p> The plan was not only rejected by local residents , with the assistance of priests and student activists , but it touched off a massive social movement that focused a city-wide debate on urban development . While politicians promised that the highway would " integrate " poor areas into the city and denied any political or economic motivations behind the project , residents resisted the proposal as a road for the wealthy and as a threat to their homes . <p> Residents of the eastern barrios responded by forming Comits Prodefensa , or local defense committees . Neighborhood committees eventually joined together to form a network of well-informed , well-organized opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement from the San Martin barrio , explained the purpose of the committees in a 1993 interview : " That was so that we would unite all the barrios , because we were resolved not to let ourselves be mistreated a no dejarnos fregar . And it was very useful . " Women were especially active in the movement . This was particularly true in the Mariscal Sucre neighborhood , where a group of women became known as " the three Maras . " The women were regarded for their tenacity and obstinacy . Perhaps because of their role as protectors of family and home , their public roles and aggressive tactics were encouraged and admired rather than discouraged by the men . One of the most poignant events of the movement was a mock burial of the highway , held at a community center in 1973 , in which the development project was represented as a coffin into which dozens of activists placed letters of protest . <p> For priests involved in the movement , it was a chance to apply the admonitions of liberation theology , emerging at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daily struggles . For student activists and Marxists , it was a chance to decry the neocolonialism of foreign-supported development and to situate the conflicts of rapid urbanization within the context of class struggle . The residents of the neighborhoods saw through the government 's rhetoric of development as integration ( President Misael Pastrana 1970-1974 often touted the development program as a way to do away with " the two cities , " that is , the division between the modern metropolis and the impoverished periphery ) and allied with priests , students , and Marxist opposition leaders in an effort to save their homes and neighborhoods from bulldozers and land-speculators . <p> Whatever the true demise of the highway , the residents continue to believe that they buried the project through their collective opposition . The importance of this history for understanding present responses to sustainable development in the area is that the movement against the Avenida de los Cerros created a group of leaders and organizers in the area as well as organizational networks that can be quickly mobilized to confront new development initiatives that may threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the movement have sustained a suspicion of development and clientalist rhetoric from politicians . While residents of the eastern barrios share many of the development aspirations of the wealthy and middle classes , they are quick to examine how government projects and policies will effect them and to reject the simple rhetoric of integration . Their own notions of development are commonly expressed as a desire to move forward , salir adelante , a term they frequently use when discussing goals for the family , including education , better housing , and services . Many people I spoke with while living and interviewing in the hills used the expression " sacar pa ' adelante a los nios , " by which they meant both the task of raising their children as well as providing them with new and better opportunities than they had . Such statements obviously share much with government rhetoric of progress and middle-class values , but they are also often accompanied by skepticism about government programs that claim to help them . As Pigg argues in her study of Nepalese villagers , people may resist specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As a result of mismanagement , political entanglements with opposition parties , and the social movement against the highway , the road was never built as planned . In the 1980s a scaled-down version of the road was built , the Avenida Circunvalar , and again residents organized to assure that any expropriated land would be fully compensated . As a result of pressure and collective action from the barrios , all displaced families received compensation , even those who had no legal title to the land . As with the first effort to construct a highway , residents of the hills did not accept the government 's justification for the road as a symbol of progress and development . Rather , they view it as a symbol of wealthy excess and the costly intrusion of the government , one that they were forced to support with their property taxes . Teresa Daz , whose house stands just above the highway in the barrio of El Paraiso , commented to me in 1993 , " They had the Avenida for the rich , who pass by with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the taxes for the road almost never use that road . " Luis Montaa , a young leader in San Martn , believes that the city government was determined to build a road for wealthy commuters : <p> After the Avenida de los Cerros failed was when they invented the Avenida Circunvalar . They -- the state -- just could n't accept the fact that they could n't carry out a huge project like that , where the poor would pay the price for easing the traffic for the fat eats in the north los mantecos del norte , right ? They invented the Avenida de los Cerros , which for them was like the ultimate . And they could sleep a little more.but everything fell through . Then they invented the Avenida Circunvalar . <p> The response thus far to attempts at sustainable development in the eastern hills has been similar . Residents bemoan the growth of wealthy housing in the area , which not only threatens their tenure , but has altered the landscape that they love . Rosa Rincn Tangua , of the barrio Bosque Caldern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the incursions of apartment buildings for the wealthy as " Just like the countryside , and nobody gave us any trouble " ( Todo un campo , y naiden nos amargaba la vida ) . <p> When leaders from several eastern barrios met with Jaime Rodriguez Azuero , the director of the Taller Local , about the JAL plan in July 1993 , local residents confronted Rodriguez and challenged his claim of " participatory planning . " In a meeting arranged by a lawyer who helps represent the barrios in land disputes , residents berated Rodriguez for failing to include them in the planning process . Rodriguez spoke nervously about the need to include the community in the development study . He explained , however , that including the participation of the community too soon could affect the methodology of the study , and might bring undo political pressures to bear on the technical phases of the study . Nonetheless , in the Phase II report that he drafted for the JAL , he claims that " community representatives " were involved in the planning process from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , encouraged from the beginning , allowed the study to go beyond the theoretical context " ( JAL 1993b : unpaginated ) . It becomes clear reading the report that participation includes only government agencies , planners , and experts , and not those likely to be affected by the plan . This effort to depoliticize the issue of participation did not succeed in winning over the residents of the eastern hills . One leader from Los Olives said during the meeting , <p> I feel that once again they have pulled a fast one on us nos volvieron a hacer un golazo , and that we did n't have anything to say about it . It is not clear what you all were going to do to the barrios .. I think that this plan was very secretive . <p> Permanent neighborhood committees , or Juntas de Accin Comunal , throughout the eastern hills , continue to monitor the efforts of government and private groups to " develop " the hills . The residents ' vision of " integration " into the city is the extension of services such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently cable and satellite TV ) , not the incursion of government management and control , which they continue to resist . <p> Conclusions <p> Recent critical works in anthropology about development have provided new insights into the way in which development works as a powerful discourse to shape how we perceive social change . If they have shown development to be a regime of representation , however , they have largely failed to reveal the agents of this repressive system . By leaving out or simplifying agency , they portray development as both more unified and more powerful than it is . In their vision of development without subjects , poststructuralist critics also portray agents as largely unaware of the social processes in which they are caught . Yet , while the consequences of development may often be unintended and misunderstood by those involved , this fact does not mean that conscious actions and motivations have no role in shaping development interventions . <p> By imagining resistance to be the answer to the " development nightmare " without defining resistance or looking at in-depth examples , they provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without ever defining what those alternatives might be . In Bogot , development , and its current manifestation , sustainable development , is not only a discourse imposed by the World Bank , but a powerful tool imported and rewritten by local and national elites . While development projects may afford local governments and national elites great powers to pursue their interests , the extension of state management and control does not go unchallenged by development 's targets who play a vital role in shaping the development encounter . <p> Local governmental and non-governmental agencies have taken advantage of the vague nature of the sustainable development concept and applied the term to projects that have no clear environmental agenda . Rather , ecological claims as well as those of broad participation in planning seem to be an attempt to disguise political and economic interests , to win government approval and in some cases foreign funding . In the eastern hills of Bogot the motivation seems to be the " consolidation " of marginal settlements made visible by a 1980s highway project . The highway is a symbol of progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northeastern Bogot , while the barrios are seen as a threat and an unpleasant sign of underdevelopment .

This translates to more than 40,000 children receiving treatment for cancer each year .

Cancer remains the number one cause of death by disease in children ( NCI , 2017 ) .

In addition to the shock and emotional stress associated with the enormity of the diagnosis , parents often confront an overwhelming amount of information that they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avci , 2013 ) . Given the nature of the disease , it is imperative that families make decisions about their child 's treatment and treatment facility almost immediately upon learning about their child 's diagnosis . # As there are a limited number of treatment facilities qualified to treat pediatric cancer , families are often faced with the revelation that they will need to relocate for months or years to pursue treatment for their child . Furthermore , parents frequently report difficulty not only with emotional coping and life planning , but with acquiring and understanding all the information needed and made available to them at the time of their child 's diagnosis ( Grootenhuis &amp; Last , 1997 ) . Therefore , while attempting to manage the shock and fear of the initial diagnosis , parents are also required to make overwhelmingly important decisions about their child 's care during a traumatic time in their lives . # During this time , counselors can not only empathetically address the grief , shock , and trauma parents are experiencing from the initial diagnosis , but also address the gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents with support and resources to aid them in their decisions . Evidenceased strategies that focus on stress reduction and trauma management ( e.g. , acceptance and commitment therapy ACT , mindfulness-based cognitive therapy MBCT , and mindfulness-based stress reduction MBSR ) , in addition to empathetic listening ( Rogers , 1979 ) , might be most helpful at this phase in a parent 's counseling . These strategies ( i.e. , ACT , MBCT , MBSR ) can help parents allow uncomfortable thoughts and feelings about their child 's illness to arise without assigning a value judgment to these thoughts or emotions ( Hayes , 2004 ) . Counselors can give parents the tools to accept their thoughts and feelings , rather than denying or fighting them . This will assist parents in connecting with the present moment , freeing them to make important decisions for their child ( Ruiz , 2012 ) . # Child 's Prognosis # A survival statistic is an individualized calculation that consists of a percentage and time period that estimates the likelihood cancer treatment will be successful ( e.g. , a 50% chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Liu et al. , 2017 ) . In determining a child 's survival statistic , medical professionals must take into account the pediatric cancer type ( e.g. , leukemia , brain cancer , lymphoma , kidney tumors , neuroblastoma ) , subtype ( e.g. , one of more than 100 different types of brain tumors ) , location or locations ( e.g. , spine , heart , lungs , liver ) , and stage ( I through IV ; NCI , 2017 ) . The combination of these four factors , along with other considerations , can lead to a wide array of prognoses ( e.g. , from a 99.9% survival rate over 10 years to a 0% survival rate with a few weeks to live ) . Each prognosis comes with its own distinct , empirically based recommendations for treatment . # When providing therapeutic services to the parents of a child with cancer , it is also important for counselors to consider each parent 's perception of their child 's cancer prognosis . This understanding can provide counselors with key information that could assist them in determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fayed et al . ( 2011 ) , parents ' prediction of their child 's chance of survival is the most important factor in determining how they feel about their child 's treatment . Furthermore , having an accurate depiction of parents ' current level of psychological distress can aid counselors in choosing appropriate intervention strategies to meet each parent 's individual psychological needs . However , parents ' prediction of the child 's prognosis does not always align with the projection from the child 's oncologist ( Fayed et al. , 2011 ) . Therefore , it is important for counselors to accurately assess both the oncologist 's appraisal of the child 's prognosis ( the survival statistic ) and parents ' interpretation of the child 's likelihood for survival , given that there could be contradiction between the two . # A counselor 's ability to assess a discrepancy between oncologists ' predictions of a child 's chances of survival and the parents ' assessments could lead to a better understanding of each parent within the couple . For example , a contradiction between the parents ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , if one marital partner is optimistic about their child 's chances and the other is pessimistic ) , and vacillations in mood from hope to despair , or despair to hope , as the parent moves from their own optimism or pessimism back to the figure given to them by the oncologist. # Counselors could use these in-depth insights into the complex psychological functioning of this population to assist parents . Specifically , parents often experience ambivalence , outside of their own awareness , about their child 's chances of survival . For example , a parent with a child who was given a 40% chance of living might sometimes think , " My child is going to suffer through treatment only to die a horrible death , " thereby feeling helpless , hopeless , and depressed . At other times , this same parent might think , " My child will have to suffer through treatment , but their suffering will come to an end and they will get to live , " thereby likely feeling hopeful . Counselors could first attempt to raise parents ' awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's chances of survival influence their emotions ( Hayes , 2004 ) . Then counselors could assist parents in understanding the connection between their ambivalent thoughts and feelings . Finally , counselors could teach parents to detach from unwelcome thoughts and feelings , thereby assisting parents in coping with feelings of depression or anxiety associated with their child 's illness . # Age of the Child # The developmental age and capability of the child diagnosed with cancer present their own unique set of characteristics . Although there does not seem to be a correlation between child 's age at diagnosis and parental distress ( Santos , Crespo , Canavarro , Alderfer , &amp; Kazak , 2016 ) , it is important for an empathetic counselor to understand the developmental issues that are unique to parents with children from varying age groups . This section discusses some of the differing challenges associated with various age groups of children with cancer . # Infants and other noncommunicative children . Parents of infants , or of other children who are incapable of caring for themselves or communicating , report a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty with ( a ) managing emesis and mouth and gastrointestinal tract sores ( mucositis ) during and after chemotherapy to ensure the child does not choke ; ( b ) changing diapers without being exposed to the toxic chemicals inherent in the child 's waste after chemotherapy ; ( c ) maintaining their infant or child 's central line or gastrointestinal tube ; ( d ) dealing with feeding issues , as infants often refuse sustenance after harsh chemotherapy treatments and therefore are at risk of starvation and dehydration ; ( e ) preventing their infant from becoming exposed to airborne germs , given that protective face masks are not designed for infants ; ( f ) administering medications ; ( g ) helping the child meet developmental milestones while in treatment ; and ( h ) understanding whether and where something is hurting the child , given the communication barrier ( Edelstein , Schippke , Sheffe , &amp; Kingsnorth , 2017 ) . # Toddlers . Parents of toddlers face similar issues . However , with this population , the child has increased ability to communicate and understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added challenge for parents . The ability to speak and understand can be a relief to parents , because the child may be able to communicate what hurts and where , making some aspects of treatment easier ( e.g. , managing nausea/vomiting and pain ) . However , additional issues parents report with this age group include stress related to difficulty ( a ) obtaining blood draws ; ( b ) administering chemotherapy ; ( c ) preventing children from harming themselves from pulling or chewing on intravenous cords ; ( d ) getting the child to wear a mask to minimize exposure to airborne germs ; ( e ) preventing oral and tactile germ exposure , given this age group 's limited understanding and their need for tactile and oral exploration of their environment ; and ( f ) dealing with the child 's overall increased fear of and lack of cooperation with treatment ( Katz &amp; And , 1980 ) . # Older children . As children age and communication improves , some of the issues presented above can improve . However , some children experience such acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply checking the child 's temperature or administering medication can be a daily struggle , causing further stress not only to the child but also to the parents ( Katz &amp; And , 1980 ) . In addition , as children become more aware of their condition , they begin to fear not only pain but death as well . The children 's cancer research literature ( Bayat et al. , 2008 ; Fayed et al. , 2011 ; Tsimicalis et al. , 2012 ) reports parents often feel guilt , despair , and depression when their children begin to fear death . In addition , parents can have difficulty managing their child 's emotions , inquiries , and assumptions related to death ( Kostak &amp; Avci , 2013 ) . # Adolescents . A parent with a child who has a cancer diagnosis during adolescence will often endure some of the same difficulties obtaining cooperation with treatment , along with the existential anxieties mentioned above . However , academic , social , and self-esteem issues can also arise . Although some of these issues can arise at almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with comforting and supporting their adolescent child with issues related to ( a ) not being able to see friends or significant others , ( b ) losing their hair , ( c ) postponing or keeping up with their academics , and ( d ) missing or delaying key life events ( e.g. , attending prom , obtaining a driver 's license , or attending graduation or college ; Cho &amp; Park , 2015 ) . In studies exploring adolescents ' perceptions of their diagnoses , members of this age group often discussed feeling frustration , resentment , and lack of control ( Lombardo , Popim , &amp; Suman , 2011 ; Wu , Chin , Haase , &amp; Chen , 2009 ) . These studies also discovered a correlation between adolescents ' feeling of frustration about their diagnosis and noncompliance with treatment . Pelcovitz et al . ( 1998 ) reported that , although adolescents who were diagnosed with cancer were particularly vulnerable to the traumatic effects the life-threatening illness presented , they were also at a cognitive and emotional advantage when compared with younger children . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer diagnosis , it is important to consider their child 's age , as it shapes the key concerns central to parents . # Given that parents of infants and toddlers are more likely to be concerned about coping with issues related to their child 's care , to parent-child attachment , or to helping their child meet developmental milestones , counselors may want to incorporate strategies from developmental counseling ( Piaget , 1937 ) or attachment theory ( Bowlby , 1969 ) into their counseling with this population . However , when working with parents of older children , trained counselors might want to explore the existential themes of death , freedom , isolation , and meaninglessness ( Yalom , 1980 ) with their clients . Through exploring their values and ideals surrounding these themes , parents would ideally become more comfortable and self-aware . Thus , parents would be better equipped to cope with and discuss the concerns that are common with older children ( i.e. , meaning , fear of death , lost relationships ) . # Adherence to treatment is an area of concern for parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is vastly different between age groups . The therapeutic strategies counselors use to help parents increase their child 's adherence to treatment should match the child 's developmental age . Whereas nonverbal strategies such as filial therapy ( Bratton , Landreth , Kellam , &amp; Blackard , 2006 ) or behavioral strategies ( Zemp , Milek , Cummings , Cina , &amp; Bodenmann , 2016 ) may work better for assisting parents with toddlers or small children , talk therapy strategies such as Adlerian therapy ( McVitte &amp; Best , 2009 ) or motivational interviewing ( Miller &amp; Rollnick , 2002 ) might be more appropriate empirically based tactics for parents of older children and adolescents . # Short-Term Consequences of Treatment # Although the short-term consequences for each parent population vary according to the child 's treatment regimen , this section addresses some of the diverse short-term issues parents may encounter across a range of treatments . # One challenge to parents of children undergoing cancer treatment is the risk of infection . Whether their child 's treatment protocol involves radiation , chemotherapy , or surgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to bacteria and viruses that could , depending on the phase of treatment and illness contracted , potentially ( a ) postpone treatment , ( b ) cause a life-threatening infection , or ( c ) lead to serious illness or in some severe cases death ( Styczynski et al. , 2016 ) . Thus , the potential repercussions of exposure to even minor illnesses ( like the common cold ) in some cases and phases of the child 's treatment could be dire . # Parents are often instructed to take the strictest precautions during a period of time called nadir ( the time period when their child has no immune system with which to fight infection ; Hyo Sook et al. , 2007 ) . This time period often occurs after the child has received certain chemotherapy drugs . Parents are asked to isolate their child from others and limit their own exposure to germs , given the risk of spreading these germs to their child . During these time periods , some parents choose to wear masks to protect themselves ( thereby protecting their children ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community ( i.e. , to the grocery store , pharmacy , doctor 's office , or counseling center ) . These periods of isolation can also lead to loneliness and amplify parents ' anxiety and depression ( Adams et al. , 2016 ) . Thus , this population 's added need to protect their children from infection can further add to their emotional unrest . If a counselor or staff member is or has been sick , these ill individuals should immediately take precautions ( i.e. , the ill person should refrain from touching the clients and should wear a mask as a form of reverse protection ) , and counselors should make their client(s) aware of their own or their staff 's illness before they come for counseling . # In addition to the risk of germ exposure , parents of children receiving radiation or certain chemotherapy drugs need to be vigilant about a whole host of symptoms ( e.g. , seizures , tremors , fevers , rashes that indicate low platelet counts , changes in mood ; Gharzai et al. , 2016 ; Kung , Zhang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al. , 2013 ) . This means parents might be particularly anxious during certain periods in their child 's treatment . Thus , counselors can recognize and even predict these times of additional strain by staying abreast of the child 's medical treatment plan and assist parents in identifying , expressing , and normalizing emotions during these taxing intervals . # It is important for counselors to understand that parents , in addition to being isolated for periods of time from friends , distant family , and the general public , are often isolated from their immediate family ( i.e. , their other children and spouse or partner ; Edwards &amp; Clarke , 2004 ) . Parents and primary caregivers frequently report that they stay overnight in the hospital with their child whenever possible ( McCann , 2008 ) . However , in most hospitals , " well children " are not allowed to stay in the hospital room after visiting hours , and with some forms of cancer treatment ( e.g. , stem cell rescue chemotherapy ) , children are not allowed to visit at all . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one parent has to work and care for the other children in the home , leading to a temporary separation that can span weeks or months at a time and cause strain on marital and parent -- child relationships ( Edwards &amp; Clarke , 2004 ) . # Adding to the magnitude of the isolation and of managing the emotional consequences of their child 's diagnosis , parents also report stress and encumbrance related to overseeing the increasingly complex medical needs of their child ( Edelstein et al. , 2017 ) . For example , children often require a host of medications to manage the side effects of chemotherapy , and these medications can be difficult and time-consuming to administer . Parents are required to quickly learn each of the medications required , along with the methods for administering each medicine . Parents may also have to provide daily care for a central venous catheter , gastronomy feeding tube , nasogastric tube , or implanted port . In addition , parents often have to meet their child 's changing nutritional needs . This can mean learning how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly monitoring their child 's daily caloric intake . Furthermore , as previously mentioned , managing germ exposure is a common issue with which parents must contend . Thus , in addition to isolation , parents must make sure they frequently wash their child 's hands , body , clothing , and bedding . With the increased care needs of the child , parents report enduring a great deal of added psychological distress that often falls in the clinical range ( Grootenhuis &amp; Last , 1997 ; Young , Dixon-Woods , &amp; Heney , 2002 ) . # While managing feelings of isolation , parents also often feel they have to maintain a degree of emotional composure when caring for their child . Parents commonly report the need to " stay strong " for their child . Thus , simply having a nonjudgmental , empathetic , safe place for parents to process their fears , stresses , and challenges could be therapeutically beneficial to parents . This safe place ( i.e. , the counselor 's office ) could not only provide parents with relief from isolation but also give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coping with caregiving , and attend to their own needs , so that they can find the strength to care for their child . # Although family or couples therapy might not be possible given the reasons cited above , counselors might spend time normalizing and exploring any feelings of abandonment , isolation , and loss the caregiver feels for their children and spouse . Specific therapeutic recommendations for creating dailycouples or parent-sibling time via video conferencing or phone calls may also be provided to decrease feelings of isolation ( on the part of both caregiver and family member ) and encourage relational bonding . # Long-Term Consequences of Treatment # A variety of factors impact the potential and assured long-term consequences of cancer treatment , and parents often must weigh the risks and benefits of each type of treatment to make expeditious decisions about their child 's care . For example , parents are frequently asked to decide whether or not ( a ) to give their child 's neurosurgeon permission to cut away live or necessary brain tissue that has been invaded by a tumor ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is not of the age recommended for radiation ; ( c ) to proceed with chemotherapy ; ( d ) to decrease the recommended dose of chemotherapy drugs in order to inhibit secondary long-term side effects ; or ( e ) to terminate or forego treatment altogether ( Imbach , Kiihne , &amp; Arceci , 2006 ) . These decisions , along with the weight of their consequences , can have an enormous effect on parents ' mental health ( Edwards &amp; Clarke , 2004 ) . Thus , it is important for counselors to understand that these decisions might be weighing on parents before attempting to provide them with counseling . # Other long-term consequences of treatment that might weigh on parents ' minds include the effects of the chemotherapy drugs their child has to take . There are several different chemotherapy drugs , each with their own method of administration ( e.g. , intravenous , topical , oral , injection ) , implications for use with specific types/subtypes/grades of cancer , and side effects ( Imbach et al. , 2006 ) . Some treatment regimens call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few , and some do not necessitate chemotherapy at all ( Sloper , 2000 ) . Some chemotherapy drugs can cause irreversible hearing loss and kidney damage , and others can cause irreversible sterility ( Wasilewski-ker et al , 2014 ) . Some additional long-term effects of chemotherapy and other common treatments for cancer ( e.g. , radiation , stem cell transplant , and surgery ) on children include emotional and behavioral problems , decreased IQ , organ failure or complications ( e.g. , heart , lung , liver ) , paralysis , loss of limb(s) , permanent loss of consciousness , scars , and secondary cancers . Thus , parents may be struggling with accepting the long-term consequences that the treatment itself will have on their child , and counselors can help parents confront and normalize their fears . # Parents ' concerns can be debilitating , and being faced with a choice that may influence whether their child lives or dies can be traumatic . After spending time processing parents ' feelings about the long-term consequences of their child 's treatment , counselors may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and accepting the painful thoughts and feelings associated with the real and potential consequences of their decisions about their child 's treatment . ACT ( Ruiz , 2012 ) can be beneficial in teaching parents to detach from their worries and memories , allowing them to make informed choices about their child 's treatment without feeling crippling emotional pain . A process in ACT , cognitive defusion ( Hayes , 2004 ) , helps individuals understand that thoughts are just thoughts , without minimizing the very real circumstances behind them . # For example , a parent might struggle with whether to decrease the dose of chemotherapy because their child is suffering long-term , permanent hearing loss . The parent might think , " If I decrease the chemotherapy dose and my child dies of cancer , I will regret the decision and feel responsible for their death . On the other hand , if I keep the dose the same and my child can not hear for the rest of their life , I will feel responsible for their hearing loss . " A clinician , trained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how thoughts such as these are impacting their feelings ( e.g. , guilt , discomfort , pain ) and then assist them in defusing/detaching from the maladaptive feelings . Thus , strategies associated with ACT may be helpful in assisting parents with coping with the long-term consequences of cancer treatment on their child 's health and emotional well-being . # Additional Psychological Consequences and Stressors # Counselors also need to be alert to additional common emotional consequences for the parents of children with cancer . Several psychological consequences and stressors are well documented in the research literature ( Bayat et al. , 2008 ; Baykan , Bayan , &amp; Nacar , 2010 ; Elcigil &amp; Conk , 2010 ; Hung et al. , 2004 ; Kostak &amp; Avci , 2013 ; Lansky , Cairns , Hassanein , Wehr , &amp; Lowman , 1978 ; Sloper , 2000 ; Tsimicalis et al. , 2012 ) . These consequences include depression ( Bayat et al. , 2008 ; Kostak &amp; Avci , 2013 ) , posttraumatic stress ( Kazak , 2005 ) , sadness ( Sloper , 2000 ) , anxiety ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 ) , marital discord ( Lansky et al. , 1978 ) , financial costs ( Santos et al. , 2016 ; Tsimicalis et al. , 2012 ) , sibling issues ( Johnson , 1997 ) , diminished social relationships ( Elcigil &amp; Conk , 2010 ) , mental disorders ( Kostak &amp; Avci , 2013 ) , stress levels ( Hung et al. , 2004 ) , and decreased life satisfaction ( Baykan et al. , 2010 ) . # Although not well documented in the research literature , insurance complications can add to parents ' list of severe psychological stressors ( Edelstein et al. , 2017 ) . It is common for insurance to deny children access to very highpriced treatments , even when they are common practice and an accepted , empirically based part of their treatment regimen . Although medical staff can appeal these decisions , and insurance companies typically end up approving the treatments in the end , this process can take days , weeks , or months , allowing time for the child 's cancer to regroup , grow , and spread . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood cancer can proliferate at alarming speeds , in some cases doubling in size every 8 to 12 hours ( Ossola , 2017 ) . Thus , as parents understand the enormous costs these postponements or rejections may have on their child 's chances of survival , they may feel hopeless , helpless , and angry when insurance companies delay or deny their child access to much-needed treatment . # Counselors should be aware of the psychological problems experienced by parents , thoroughly assess parents within each of the domains of functioning listed above , and provide this population with strategies to cope with these common issues . Some of the ways counselors can help parents cope include normalizing and preparing them for the potential setbacks in each of the domains above . Specifically , counselors can prepare parents by structuring in vivo experiences ( Hayes , 2004 ) , thereby making them aware of these potential difficulties before they arise . Counselors could assist parents in identifying and differentiating between thoughts , feelings , and behaviors associated within each of the domains above . This awareness , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may ease parents ' shock and disturbance . # DISCUSSION # For the parent of a child with cancer , life abruptly becomes chaotic and distressing . Caring for a child who has cancer predisposes parents to a multitude of psychological stressors . Parents ' psychological distress is often compounded by ( a ) the need to make difficult expedited decisions about their child 's care ; ( b ) their perceptions of their child 's prognosis ; ( c ) the unique developmental demands of their child ; ( d ) their concern over the short- and long-term consequences of their child 's treatment ; ( e ) the need to meet the increased care needs of their child ; ( f ) their own feelings of sadness , anxiety , stress , and depression ; ( g ) the financial costs ; ( h ) the difficulty maintaining harmony within their relationships ; and ( i ) the insurance-aggravated delays in treatment . # Parents can greatly benefit from counseling . Using the knowledge gained from understanding parents ' unique situations , the well-trained counselor can provide support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents by a counselor can facilitate emotional coping and can help ease a family through these long periods of crisis . Counselors who are equipped with the knowledge of what parents might be experiencing as their child is in treatment can tailor their therapeutic strategies to meet their client 's needs . Specifically , whereas parents who have children in the early diagnostic stages of treatment may need strategies that are designed to assist clients in more effectively managing their emotions ( e.g. , MBSR , ACT ) , parents who are in the midst of treatment and are feeling isolated , afraid , and alone may benefit from having a safe place to process their thoughts and feelings in a nonjudgmental environment . However , counselors must be thoroughly trained in the use of therapeutic practices and techniques before employing them with clients . In addition , the therapeutic strategies mentioned in this article are not exhaustive and are meant to serve as suggestions , rather than directives . There are several methods of counseling that would be equally effective with this client population . However , this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be effective with the parents of children with cancer . # Research on counseling parents of children with cancer is lacking . The purposes of this article are to fill gaps in the research literature , begin a muchneeded discourse on this important topic , inform practitioners about some of the experiences parents may go through , and provide suggestions for assisting parents at various stages of their child 's treatment . However , additional research is needed to assess the use of empirically based treatments with parents of children who have cancer . # REFERENCES # Adams , R. , Mosher , C. , Abonour , R. , Robertson , M. , Champion , V. , &amp; Kroenke , K.

E-mail : @@4002741 Section : Bush at Midterm HITTING THE RIGHT TARGETS <p> TWO YEARS have passed since the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist strikes aroused the United States from its post-Cold War strategic slumber . The attacks spurred Washington to action and offered an opportunity for fresh thinking in foreign policy . To meet the challenge posed by large-scale terrorism of global reach , the Bush administration has mobilized the country , assembled substantial armed coalitions , overturned two hostile regimes , weakened the leading terrorist network , and adopted a posture of forward defense against future attacks . It has also refocused relations with Russia , China , and Europe to deal with terrorism and the threat of weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) in the hands of rogue regimes . <p> Despite these important achievements , there is something wrong with the big picture . The administration may be hitting its immediate targets , but it is only paying lip service to the broader objective of achieving a safer and better world order . Forcing U.S. global policies into the simplifying framework of a " war on terrorism " creates the illusion that there is one enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union during the Cold War . Terrorism is a tool , not an actor , and conflating the menace of terrorism with the threat posed by WMD in the hands of evil regimes further distorts the strategic picture . By concentrating on worst-case scenarios of immediate vulnerability , moreover , the Bush administration overlooks the failed-state crucible in which many threats to U.S. interests are forged and risks alienating the partners and undercutting the credibility required to address them . <p> Now that the United States has carried out several bold military campaigns to unseat odious rulers , it must face the reality that these are only the first steps in building global security . Acknowledging this truth openly is the only way to mobilize U.S. and international attention , resources , and staying power . It is time , therefore , for a fresh articulation of Washington 's purposes , centered on sustaining regional security , leading coalitions and institutions to help failing and threatened states , and winning the struggle after wars end and regimes change . <p> In some ways , the situation is ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a determined United States toward sustained engagement in the international system . In this sense , the attacks of September 11 were both a wake-up call and a golden opportunity to explain to the U.S. public why serious involvement with the outside world is necessary . And the Bush administration 's National Security Strategy , released in September 2002 , quietly but explicitly identified the importance of dealing with the problem of failed and failing states . American policymakers have been underestimating this challenge for years . State failure directly affects a broad range of U.S. interests , including the promotion of human rights , good governance , the rule of law , religious tolerance , environmental preservation , and opportunities for U.S. investors and exporters . It contributes to regional insecurity , weapons proliferation , narcotics trafficking , and terrorism . Yet since the strategy was sent to Congress a year ago , the administration has made helping failing and failed states a secondary priority . <p> The reasoning behind this lapse , presumably , is that rogues that seek to acquire WMD constitute a more pressing threat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burner means that turbulence continues to spread throughout the Middle East , Africa , the Andean nations , South and Central Asia , and parts of Southeast Asia . Concentrating on rogues first and foremost could create the false sense that deeper problems are being resolved . Regime change may be more satisfying than long-term statecraft ; it is certainly more telegenic . But unless the United States and its principal partners engage proactively to prevent and contain state failure , rogue regimes may seize power in additional failed or failing states , raising the specter of fresh adversaries that seek wmd and harbor terrorists . Moreover , the United States must learn to rebuild states after overturning their regimes , or the whole enterprise will backfire . SLIP SLIDING AWAY <p> STATE FAILURE is a gradual process . Self-interested rulers might progressively corrupt the central organs of government ( as in Burma or in Nigeria during Sani Abacha 's regime ) . Corrupt elites might ally themselves with criminal networks to divide the spoils ( as in Liberia and parts of the former Yugoslavia ) . State authority might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for illegal trading operations ( as in parts of Georgia and Colombia ) . During transitions away from authoritarianism , state security services might lose their monopoly on the instruments of violence , leading to a downward spiral of lawlessness ( as in several Central American states since the early 1990s ) . The complete collapse of state power in large sections of a country ( as in Lebanon during the 1970s and 1980s and Congo for much of the past five years ) is only the most extreme version of the phenomenon . <p> States with shallow domestic legitimacy tend to fail when they lose foreign support , as often happened in the former colonial domains of European empires . Failure is accelerated when the major actors in the international system abandon local regimes no longer deemed acceptable or convenient partners . Afghanistan exemplifies how an already war-torn polity failed after the strategic disengagement of Moscow and Washington in the early 1990s , ending up as a haven for terrorists . States may also fail due to regional contagion exported by rogues and warlords , as has occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inextricably linked with internal strife and humanitarian crisis , can spread from localized unrest to national collapse and then regional destabilization . And unattractive entities -- some hostile to U.S. security interests , others hostile to Washington 's humanitarian and political goals -- may rise to fill the political vacuum . Invariably , state failure is accompanied by the victory of guns over normal politics , the rise of corrupt autocrats who thrive on conflict and deny freedom to their people . <p> It was fashionable for a period in the 1990s to speak of " democratic transitions , " as though the final destination were a given . In reality , some countries will make it , some will remain stuck in failed and weak governance , some will become wards of the international system , some will descend into chaotic warlord struggles , and others will revert to authoritarianism . Which outcome emerges in a particular case will depend on many factors -- not least on the action ( or inaction ) of the world 's leading powers . <p> During the 1990s , when faith in globalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " big emerging markets " would change the face of global economics and politics and should therefore become the focal points of U.S. involvement . But however pivotal such states may be , the United States can not confine itself to cherry-picking its way through the " best " of the transitional world while averting its gaze from the world 's strategic slums . Much of the contemporary international state system is crumbling beneath the burdens of warfare , stagnant or declining per capita growth , pandemic disease , rampant official corruption , and autocracy . Turkey may be a beacon of hope for the Muslim world , but it has few parallels . For every South Africa , there are dozens of struggling or failing entities such as Zambia and the Central African Republic . India may be heading in an exciting direction , but much of the rest of South and Central Asia is a mess . <p> Washington needs to look closely at the relationship between conflict , regime change , and state failure . According to a biennial report published by the University of Maryland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has decreased by 50 percent since its peak in the mid-1980s and is now at the lowest level since the early 1960s . Still , at the end of 2002 , there remained 25 countries engaged in ongoing or sporadic violence , the great majority due to civil strife over the control of government , people , or resources . The report identifies 33 societies emerging from recent wars and nearly 50 regimes located somewhere between autocracy and democracy . <p> New regimes -- whether emerging from wars , negotiated transitions and first-ever elections , or foreign- or domestic-led regime change -- tend to be fragile . They may require decades to become institutionalized states operating under the rule of law . In the meantime , the societies around them are ripe for exploitation by ambitious and greedy factions . Law and order , justice , accountability , public services , job creation , and investor confidence are all in short supply . <p> But the challenge is not only to address state failure in the handful of states where regimes get overthrown . It is also to stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In much of the transitional world -- those at-risk societies concentrated in Africa , the Middle East , and southwestern Asia -- there is a footrace under way between legitimate governmental institutions and legal business enterprises , on the one hand , and criminal networks , often linked to warlords or political factions associated with security agencies , on the other . Frequently , the informal , undocumented economy is caught between these forces , struggling alongside embryonic civil society groups to survive and watching carefully to see which way the winds blow . When state failure sets in , the balance of power shifts ominously against ordinary civilians and in favor of armed entities operating outside the law ( or with tacit official approval ) . <p> It might appear that globalization would favor those societal actors most closely linked to international networks of commerce , banking , communications , and diplomacy . But that is only true if the legitimate networks are at least as efficient and well organized as those linking corrupt elites , warlords , and mafiosi with the external facilitators who grease the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and networks that hollow out failing states focus with a laserlike intensity on exploiting opportunity and creating facts on the ground . Whether loosely arrayed in symbiotic relations or more closely coordinated by a central brain , they find space to operate in the vacuums left by a declining or transitional state -- and they eat what they kill . GETTING THE DIAGNOSIS RIGHT <p> IN THIS VAST ZONE of transition and turbulence , the greatest problem is not the absence of nations ; it is the absence of states with the legitimacy and authority to manage their affairs . Most of these entities are recent creations , the result of European imperial expansion and subsequent withdrawal . As such , they have always derived a major , if not dominant , share of their legitimacy from the international system rather than from domestic society . <p> These states are in part a legacy of Washington 's success in accelerating the breakup of European empires and championing the aspirations of formerly dependent or colonized peoples . Although Americans seldom acknowledge it , the United States has played a central role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states in 1945 to almost 200 today . How should this legacy be tackled , and what would a serious state-building strategy involve ? <p> Much has been made of the Bush administration 's initial disdain for " nation building , " a term with unhelpful overtones from the 1960s . Nation building evokes efforts at economic development , political " modernization , " and democratization . Although these are worthy and ultimately essential activities , they are not immediately responsive to the challenge posed by state failure . <p> Of course the United States should play a role in tackling global poverty . State failures ( and associated conflicts ) overwhelmingly occur in wretchedly poor countries , not in wealthy industrial or post-industrial states . But , given the massive disparity in living standards within and among developing nations , economics alone does little to clarify policy implications : the answer to state failure can not be reduced to growth and development . <p> Focusing on political modernization , meanwhile , has been touted as a way to approach the Muslim world . After all , the 56 members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries with large Muslim populations ) include a disproportionate number of the world 's conflicted and troubled states . A civilization-based strategy , however , would obscure the issue . Islamic societies vary greatly , and many non-Islamic states are also at risk of failure . <p> Some identify autocracy as the core issue and suggest stepping up the drive for successful democratization as a bulwark against state failure . Still , there are many unknowns , such as how to sequence democratization 's key elements , whether it produces stability at first , what its overall relationship to stability is , whether it can be implanted in all soils , and what outsiders can do to help it flourish . Strong democracies lock in political health , but evidence suggests that weak democracies -- as well as reforming autocracies -- are highly prone to state failure . <p> Others argue that failed states stem from arbitrarily defined national borders that bear little relation to regional history and ethnic divisions . The implication of such reasoning is that redesigning dysfunctional states should not be discouraged . This would mean allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break apart through secession or partition . <p> But redrawing boundaries would inevitably open a Pandora 's box . To legitimize secessionism is to invite claimants large and small from throughout the unsettled zones to put their cases forward , consider military options , and seek external backing . If the intended result was to create ethnically homogenous units , the process could produce thousands of nonviable statelets . And a new standard of greater tolerance for ethnically based territorial adjustments would be opposed by existing governments , which would rightly accuse the major powers of playing with matches . <p> Moreover , research by World Bank economist Paul Collier suggests that ethnic fragmentation is not itself the problem ; conflict and state failure result from a particular type of ethnic imbalance between a dominant majority and a large minority . Contested natural resources and separatist movements supported by well-heeled expatriate communities likewise contribute to state failure . <p> In specific cases where regional or ethnic factions of a failing state appear interested in working out a full-blown separation , or where partition appears to be the only answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play in orchestrating a legitimate , negotiated , and supervised separation . The emphasis in such marginal cases should be placed on how the process of change is brought about and who endorses the result . The international system should respect consensual separation , as it did in the former Czechoslovakia and with the 1993 Eritrean split from Ethiopia ( even though this move did not solve the problem , and the sides were soon engulfed in a major war ) . <p> What about the option of standing back and letting stronger players take the law into their own hands by creating spheres of influence and protectorates or gobbling up weaker entities outright ? There are some precedents , such as Morocco 's takeover of the former Spanish Sahara in 1979 , Indonesia 's grab of East Timor in 1976 , India 's seizure of Goa in 1961 , Russia 's muscle-flexing in its " near abroad " during the 1990s , and today 's regular interventions in Congo by various of its neighbors . <p> Perhaps the best thing to be said about such a policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costs can be high when conflict returns in a different guise . And the price in terms of regional security and humanitarian losses can be horrendous : millions of people , for example , have perished in the west and central African wars of the past nine years . Equally important , intervention by local powers has not created stronger states in Russia 's near abroad , nor in sub-Saharan Africa ; rather , it has expanded the zone of state failures . It has become increasingly difficult to accept such passivity under the guise of realism . <p> Although the Bush administration appears ambitious about coercive regime change , it remains properly cautious on borders , as reflected in its adamant insistence on Iraq 's territorial integrity . Comparable caution can be seen in the prudent stance of the un Security Council 's permanent members concerning the nettlesome Western Sahara problem : every conceivable effort has been made to find a formula that preserves some form of Moroccan sovereignty and does not produce yet another weak African statelet . Such prudence is likewise evident in the Security Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African- and Western-led diplomacy on the Sudanese civil war , in the Norwegian-led ( and U.S.-backed ) mediation over Tamil separatist aspirations in Sri Lanka , in U.S.-endorsed talks being organized between the Philippine authorities and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Mindanao , and in the mediation over autonomy and power-sharing in Indonesian Aceh , led by a nongovernmental organization . <p> In each of these cases , the focus is on how to strengthen the state politically and preserve its territorial integrity through measures that decentralize power , reform abusive policies , foster responsive politics , and check central-government domination . Fortunately , these are not insurmountable challenges . A wide range of organizations and governments already work to help failing states undertake such measures as power-sharing and wealth-sharing among units and regions , constitutional and electoral engineering to give voice to cultural and ethnic minorities , and community-based projects to foster intercommunal healing and religious reconciliation . <p> But weak states also need greater administrative and governing capabilities if they are to behave as responsible , sovereign actors , including enhanced legal codes and court systems ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police forces ; stronger bank oversight and public financial management ; and closer ties between isolated financial , security , and intelligence personnel at home and abroad . Solemn exhortations for states to behave as responsible , sovereign actors are not enough : the United States needs to help them acquire sovereign capacity . WHAT IS TO BE DONE <p> THE UNITED STATES and other leading powers need to plan and coordinate their strategies for dealing with failed states more coherently , fund key programs more generously , and speak more openly and directly about how to strengthen states and why it matters to do so . The most urgent task is to create the political and organizational capacity to swing into action effectively when existing state structures are failing or about to collapse . The concept of military readiness is well understood , but readiness for what happens after the fighting stops is just as important . <p> Washington does not have the capacity for political follow-through across a broad spectrum of postconflict or post-intervention requirements . As Afghanistan and Iraq illustrate , the U.S. government lacks the interagency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and budget resources necessary for rebuilding failed states and collapsed regimes . Senior executive branch officials have resisted attempts to bring coherence to postconflict reconstruction and state-building efforts . A recent bipartisan commission report sought to address this inexcusable situation and called on the president to designate a senior interagency leader for reconstruction tasks and to create dedicated staffs addressing the issue within the State Department , the U.S. Agency for International Development , and NATO . It also urged creation of a government-wide center for coordination and training in the major dimensions of postconflict policy ( security , justice , governance , and economic recovery ) . These recommendations form the basis for the Winning the Peace Act of 2003 recently introduced in the Senate . <p> Washington 's resistance to early action in failing states is rooted , quite naturally , in the fear of getting U.S. armed forces stuck with the varied tasks of state building . But rather than an excuse for lack of preparation and inaction , the need to limit the burden on the U.S. military should be seen as a reason to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eight highly industrialized countries ( g-8 ) and other allies can provide the manpower to help get the job done , and un institutions can provide expertise and legitimacy . Failed states have become sufficiently common that the leading nations must find a way to authorize and conduct de facto trusteeships . <p> Decisions on where to invest scarce time , energy , and resources should be based on such factors as the need to avert terrorist buildups and takeovers by WMD-inclined rogues , a country 's inherent regional importance and weight , the possibility of regional side effects and contagion , and the potential humanitarian and political price of outright state collapse . <p> Once target states are selected , the major powers and institutions should focus their resources in four areas : defusing civil conflict , building state institutions , protecting the state from hostile external influences , and managing regional spread . At the June 2003 Evian summit , g-8 officials issued a joint declaration that pertains to the first three requirements . Titled " Fighting Corruption and Improving Transparency , " the document proposes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime and real transparency in reporting on revenues derived from extractive industries such as energy and mining . Such a measure is directly pertinent to governance in troubled societies such as Sudan , Indonesia , Kazakhstan , Nigeria , and Colombia . What is less clear is whether the g-8 governments will place a high priority on implementing its important provisions . Another initiative , the g-8 Africa Action Plan , outlines a wide range of capacity-building initiatives to support the adherence of African states to the good governance principles of the New Partnership for Africa 's Development . <p> Major powers are beginning to take steps to ward off state failures in Africa and other turbulent regions . Because of the breadth of the problem , a sharper focus on specific countries and regions will be more meaningful than a generalized grab bag of programs . Leading governments need to speak loudly and clearly about just what these joint efforts will involve , connecting the dots between enlightened burden-sharing , the risks of state failure in troubled regions , and their own national interests and budgets . Above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and its allies work together to ward off state failure , it is possible to limit damage and achieve real progress -- as in Sierra Leone , Sudan , Macedonia , and Sri Lanka ; when they do n't , state failure is aggravated -- as in Serbia , Congo , Colombia , and Afghanistan before September 11 . <p> Over the last two years , law enforcement and intelligence cooperation on terrorist financing have improved significantly . Interestingly , most of the agencies and regulatory frameworks brought to bear on terrorist financial networks had their origins in earlier campaigns against money laundering and financial crime . One example is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 's ( OECD ) Financial Action Task Force -- grouping 29 member countries , two international organizations , and two observer nations -- which operates by pooling information , naming and shaming ( by means of its published list of non-cooperative countries and territories ) , and imposing financial sanctions . <p> In the end , the war on terrorism requires many of the same tools and techniques needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the major powers and international bodies mobilized parallel efforts , perhaps hearkening back to expanded counterterrorist cooperation , it would not take long to disrupt some of the deadly links among narcotics trafficking , arms smuggling , and the illicit trade in precious stones and metals , timber , people , and exotic species . The techniques of forensic accounting could be used to track down ill-gotten gains , helping respectable governments recover looted assets , deterring looters and those who collude with them , and bolstering legal action against transgressors . But to make such achievements possible , the necessary personnel , budgets , and political capital must be dedicated to the effort . WALKING THE WALK , TALKING THE TALK <p> A MORE SUBSTANTIAL engagement by the United States and its primary partners is needed to address what is arguably the leading menace on the globe . This effort would begin by rebalancing the focus of public rhetoric in foreign policy toward broader and deeper engagement in state building and toward identifying the magnitude of the challenge posed by state failure . Properly packaged and articulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Challenge Account , new assistance initiatives for Africa , expanded funding to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic , multilateral trade expansion , upgraded law enforcement and intelligence sharing on terrorist finances -- could be part of a comprehensive failed-state strategy . <p> But it will be difficult to make full use of such instruments and to develop additional tools unless senior administration officials begin to explain what the United States is doing about state failure and why it matters . A broadly defined policy couched in terms of the full range of American interests and values has some chance of becoming sustainable . A narrowly defined foreign policy couched mainly in terms of military confrontation , rogues , and terrorists will not garner the breadth of domestic and international support required for sustainability . <p> The administration will also need to broaden its international political base and cease treating indispensable allies as little more than a nuisance . American leaders have a wide range of potential institutions and tools at their disposal for a long-term strategy to strengthen the capacities of sovereign states . Rather than serving as rhetorical dart boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the United Nations , NATO , the OECD , the G-8 , and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should be appreciated for what they might , if properly utilized , contribute to the effort . <p> Often the appropriate role for the globe 's superpower will be to push negotiated settlements of intractable regional conflicts , which are often fed by state failure and spawn fresh failures as they burn . But the exact negotiating structure must be tailored to each case . The Quartet ( consisting of the United States , the European Union , Russia , and the un ) appears to offer some value in the context of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks . A U.S.-led troika ( with the United Kingdom and Norway ) , plus an African group led by the Kenyans , is dealing with the conflict in Sudan . And in the India-Pakistan case , the United States plays a unique role , supported by like-minded powers . U.S. engagement should be applied to citizens as well as governments . When there are ingredients for internally led regime change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Bush administration has succeeded recently in achieving a massive increase in funding for the Defense Department , reversing years of deferred investment . The time has arrived to boost the civilian foreign affairs budget as well . Since entering office , Secretary of State Colin Powell , National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , and their colleagues have begun to reverse the long-term budget decline in this area . Yet the international affairs budget remains around one percent of the total federal budget .

@@4117441 The Holy Grail of screenwriting is a story that will immediately make agents , producers , directors and actors sit up and take notice . A recent rereading of the advertising classic Ogilvy on Advertising revealed that David Ogilvy , the godfather of modern advertising , had the prescription not only for ads with big ideas but also scripts . </p> " You will never win fame and fortune , " he writes , " unless you invent big ideas . It takes a big idea to attract the attention of consumers and get them to buy your product . Unless your advertising contains a big idea , it will pass like a ship in the night . " </p> In screenplay terms , this does n't mean you have to write one of those big summer action movies . In this case , " big " means impactful . A " small " film can have big ideas -- for example , the issue of having a child when you 're not in a relationship , which was the theme of the very successful film Juno . Another example is the classic novel and film To Kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the inspiration for their careers . </p> Ogilvy suggested asking yourself five questions to determine whether something really is a big idea : </p> * Did it make me gasp when I first saw it ? </p> * Do I wish I had thought of it myself ? </p> * Is it unique ? </p> * Does it fit the strategy to perfection ? </p> * Could it be used for 30 years ? </p> In movie terms , questions one through three make sense as they are . For question four we might substitute , " Does it fulfill the demands of the genre to perfection ? " In other words , if it 's a comedy , is it really funny ? If it 's a horror picture , is it truly scary ? And the fifth question could translate to , " Will people still want to see it in 30 years ? " </p> It 's a tall order , and probably only one out of 100 or 1,000 of your ideas will let you answer yes to all five questions . All the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with a true winner . </p> Would n't it be easier just to try to follow a formula ? You know , the hero 's journey , the three acts , the 22 steps , or one of the other templates . Could you not just fill in the blanks ? </p> The answer is no . You 're not going to get a unique story by slavishly making your story fit a predetermined pattern . Here 's what Ogilvy said about how to come up with these kinds of big ideas : " Big ideas come from the unconscious . This is true in art , in science , and in advertising . But your unconscious has to be well informed , or your idea will be irrelevant . Stuff your conscious mind with information , then unhook your rational thought process . " </p> My point is not to demonize the idea of the three-act structure or the hero 's journey , etc. , but to say they should be your servants , not your master . Your story , which comes from the unconscious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft of screenwriting , must come first . </p> Your big idea can take many forms . The core of a big idea could also be called the theme . Probably it will be something about which you feel strongly . The great advantage screenwriters and novelists have is that they can clothe their beliefs so well in entertainment , with such a great choice of genres , that even a familiar theme can become fresh again . The way that you express your theme often is the part of the big idea that makes people take notice . </p> For example , one of the great lessons of life is that sometimes the best thing you can do for someone you love is to let them go . This could be addressed in a romantic drama in which the lovers realize that their dreams for their lives are too different , or a drama about the spouse of a terminally ill person who is refusing further treatment . </p> It could even be addressed in a science-fiction context-indeed , it was , in E.T. , when young Eliott realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must help him leave . </p> Finding a new way to express a universal theme is key . It certainly worked for Steven Spielberg , and also for James Cameron when he decided to re-tell the Romeo and Juliet tale on a sinking ship . </p> Ways to get a big idea Here 's how you can encourage your subconscious mind to come up with the kind of big ideas that fit Ogilvy 's criteria : </p> * Keep a record of your dreams . Many unique stories , like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , have been inspired by dreams . </p> * Read widely , especially stories that have stood the test of time , as part of your campaign to make your unconscious well-informed . </p> * Take a notebook with you wherever you go , so you can catch fleeting thoughts ( or you can record them using your cell phone ) . </p> * When you see a movie that has an emotional impact on you , that you feel compelled to talk about to your friends , that you want to see again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much harder to conjure than the special effects in big-budget movies . </p> * Have regular brainstorming sessions where you start with a list of random words and see what ideas each one prompts . When you are brainstorming , remember to go for quantity and do n't judge the ideas as you go along . Write down all the ideas that come up , even the ones you know immediately are bad ones . </p> Later , when you sit down to evaluate what you 've come up with , you may find that combining two " bad " ideas results in one great one . Simply retelling the Romeo and Juliet story in a conventional setting would have been a weak idea , as would re-telling only the story of the Titanic 's demise . It was the combination of the two that made Titanic a huge hit . </p> A few things to play with When you have decided on a theme and want to explore a variety of ways to make it fresh , here are some elements you can play with : </p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford , benefits from taking place largely within an Amish community because it brings a man who lives by the gun into a location where nonviolence is the highest value . </p> * The gender of the protagonist . As stereotypes dissolve , this is not as big a factor as it once was , but reversing the expected roles can still add novelty , especially in comedies . One example is making Arnold Schwarzenegger a kindergarten teacher in Kindergarten Cop . </p> * The nature of the players . </p> Would your story work as an animated film ? Or could one or more of your characters be a robot , an alien , or a talking animal ? District 9 created a fresh take on apartheid by making the oppressed minority aliens . </p> The point is not to come up with a gimmick for the sake of it ; the goal is to find a means of telling the story that transforms it into a big idea . When you try out some of these variations you may find that you have a sudden " Aha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop too soon When brainstorming , it 's tempting to stop when we have a good idea . As writers , we are itching to get to the good part -- the actual writing of the script . But , as Ogilvy knew , the really big ideas are rare . When you have a good concept , continue to generate more . And then generate some more yet . It 's not the good idea you 're looking for ; it 's the great one . </p> When you 've found that , and written a terrific screenplay based on it , you may have created something unique that will make people gasp , that other writers will wish they 'd thought of , that is right on target for its genre , and that will still be on people 's " must-see " list in 30 years ' time . </p> If you can do that , Hollywood and the international film industry will be clamoring for your work .

" Following are some of those " rules . " ( Read the piece in full in the Top Tips section of yourwritingcoach.com , and sign up for my free newsletter at screenwritingsuccess.com . ) </p> Thou shalt make thy protagonists likable . Did you like the godfather ( the man , not the film ) ? Hannibal Lecter ? Did you like Rick in Casablanca ( at least for the first two-thirds of the film ) ? Probably not , but odds are you found them fascinating . If your script makes us want to see what happens next to the protagonist , that 's enough . </p> Thou shalt make thy dialogue short . One screenwriting book actually dictates , " Do n't write any dialogue longer than three lines . " Hmm , just as well Tarantino did n't read that before writing Pulp Fiction , or Alan Ball before writing American Beauty . If you have intelligent , articulate characters , why gag them ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the audience wo n't balk at longer speeches . </p> Thou shalt have a villain opposing thy protagonist . This is n't actually wrong , just not always necessary . Obviously , if you 're writing a flick in which terrorists are trying to blow up the world or a serial killer is stalking your detective , you 'll need a good bad guy . But many of the most interesting films look at how we can be our own worst enemy , or how we have to battle our circumstances ( The Full Monty , Annie Hall , Citizen Kane ) . These films are harder to write because they do n't fit as easily into structural formulas and they ask the writer to look more deeply into himself . They can be tougher to sell because they do n't appeal to the youngest audiences . However , when they work , they 're the kinds of movies that stick in peoples minds for years . </p> Thou shalt write full character biographies and outlines . For some writers , having an exact road map for their script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For others , it takes all the creative joy out of writing . Each of us has to find our own way . For example , I have found that getting to know my characters via visualizations is a hundred times more effective than writing character bios-but it might not work that way for you . </p> Thou shalt not be original . Surely nobody is saying " Do n't be original " ? Oh yes they are , just not in those exact words . Many of the scriptwriting books tell you it 's poison to write for older protagonists ( tell that to the makers of Waking Ned Devine ) , or in an unpopular genre ( see Unforgiven ) , or complex stories that may confuse the audience ( like The Usual Suspects ? ) . The fact is that every breakthrough film is , by definition , different from the norm . </p> Thou shalt make thy endings happy . Did Pulp Fiction have a happy ending ? What about American Beauty ? What about Y Tu Mam Tambin ? . A lot of excellent films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real life rather than the neat conclusions of many Hollywood studio offerings .

@@4020641 Radial head and neck fractures are the most common elbow fractures among adults , typically encountered in young to middle-aged individuals ( 1 ) . The treatment of these fractures depend on the degree of comminution , the percentage of articular surface involved , the presence of loose intra-articular fragments and the angulation between the radial neck and proximal shaft . We report a case of bilateral symmetrical radial head fractures in view of its rarity of presentation and also briefly discuss the management options of Type 1 radial head fractures . Case Report <p> A 24 year old female , a carer by occupation presented with pain in both the elbows after she sustained a fall on an outstretched hand with both the elbows in extension while playing netball . On physical examination she had minimal bruising on the right elbow with tenderness over the radiocapitellar joints on both the sides . There was no restriction to the range of movements . There was no distal neurovascular deficit . AP and lateral radiographs of both the elbows revealed symmetrical undisplaced radial head fractures ( fig.1 ) .

On the right side she had restriction of terminal 5 of extension with full flexion and full ROM of the left elbow ( fig.2 ) . She had been carrying out her routine activities and has gone back to her job as a carer . Discussion <p> Fractures of the radial head result from fall on outstretched hand . The force is transmitted along the line of the forearm producing a valgus stress at the elbow . Compression of the radial head against the capitellum commonly results in fractures due to shearing between the vertically aligned trabeculae and may also produce macroscopic damage to the capitellum . Anatomically the radial head is susceptible to fractures because of a 15 angle between the radial neck and shaft . The greater carrying angle of the female elbow may explain the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , local tenderness with associated swelling , and a positive fat pad sign with a fracture line are diagnostic features . The main problem after radial head fracture is failure to gain full extension , probably caused by fibrosis of the anterior capsule of the joint after organisation of haemarthrosis ( 3 ) and damage sustained by the capitellum of the humerus at the time of injury ( 2 ) <p> Conventional radiography with AP &; Lateral views are adequate for detection of radial head and neck fractures . Internal and external oblique radiographs are required occasionally . A special view the radiocapitellar view has been shown to increase the sensitivity by only 1% ( 7 ) and hence is not routinely used . CT with reconstruction images is of helpful in doubtful cases and aid in decision making . <p> Treatment options are based on the classification of Mason ( 1 ) who divided radial head fractures into three groups : Type I , fissure or marginal fractures without displacement ; Type II , marginal sector fractures with displacement ; Type III , comminuted fractures , involving entire head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Type IV , any radial head fracture with dislocation of the humeroulnar joint <p> By definition , type I is an undisplaced fracture , requires no reduction , and does not exhibit any mechanical block to forearm rotation . Immediate pain relief should be achieved to allow initial physical examination and to start active forearm rotation as pain allows . Type I injuries should be treated conservatively as in this case . Joint aspiration of haemarthrosis and injection of an anaesthetic into the joint may be performed to reduce pain . Early motion helps to shape and mould slight incongruities without substantial risk of displacement . <p> Mason and Shutkin ( 4 ) suggested that early mobilisation allows the fragment to find the best functional position in relation to the other joint surfaces . Bakalim ( 5 ) showed that displacement of the fragment was not associated with loss of function .

@@4089141 Last academic year , I was excited to begin studying for my Master of Fine Arts in nonfiction writing at Big Name School . I had gotten my first MFA from Middle Name School at too early an age , and I , now more mature and exploding with ideas , was ready to start what I considered my " adult MFA . " I bought notebooks , brought my clip file up to date , and envisioned all the networking opportunities my would-be professors were sure to provide . Only one obstacle stood in my path : the big , fat rejection letter I received . </p> Rather than sulk ( OK , I might have made mudslides and watched Beaches the night the letter arrived ) , I decided to spin my situation . I did n't need a fancy school -- or any school , for that matter . I could design my own makeshift MFA program geared toward exactly what I wanted to accomplish . And , best of all , I could enroll myself on the spot -- no application fee required . Turns out I 'd have a use for those notebooks after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled them with the draft of my first book . </p> There are any number of reasons why someone who wants to pursue an MFA does n't make it to the classroom : monetary concerns , time constraints , familial commitments , geographic location , and say-it-ain't-so rejection are but a handful . Whatever the circumstances , designing a self-guided program can , in many cases , bring the same end results : a marketable thesis and an iPhone full of contacts . Here are five steps eager writers can take to navigate their way : </p> 1 Define your goal . Ask yourself why an MFA program interests you . Most likely , you want to produce a book-length manuscript , so let 's take that as a given . Identifying what else you want to gain will enable you to work toward an end result that meets your personal needs . " Do you want to go into advertising or marketing ? Journalism ? " asks Brian McMillan , a journalist and 2009 graduate of Northern Michigan University 's MFA program . " The answers to those questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such advice holds true for do-it-yourself MFAs as well . </p> Though such a task might seem overwhelming , an easy way to fine-tune your thinking is to create a list . Jot the top five benefits that come to mind on a sheet of paper . Mull them over . Look at them from different angles . Decide which appeals to you most . And do n't hesitate to select more than one objective if a couple strike your fancy . </p> 2 Research existing MFA programs . Take advantage of the legwork other institutions put into planning their programs by adapting elements that scream " I 'm appealing ! Consider me ! " Look at traditional and low-residency programs , as well as different genres -- even those outside your focus . Your bible will be The AWP Official Guide to Writing Programs ( http : //guide.awpwriter.org ) , which offers a comprehensive database of national and international undergraduate and graduate writing programs . </p> As you research , take note of what interests you -- craft courses , literature courses , workshops -- as well as what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Arizona 's creative-writing MFA program , thought writing was more important to her development than literature study and chose her program accordingly . " Some MFA programs are overly academic , " Wangsness explains , " and as someone who wanted to focus exclusively on craft , these programs were not the right fit . " Understanding her interests before delving into a program helped guide her successful experience . </p> 3 Outline your semesters . Creating your own program allows you to focus on your growth as a writer ; the key is finding a workable approach . Generally , any training and literature activities should take place in the first part of your studies with heavy writing bringing up the rear . ( While you can and should discipline yourself to write from day one , absorbing lessons early on will only strengthen that writing . ) Consider how-to guides-such as The Portable MFA in Creative Writing from the New York Writers Workshop or Anne Lamott 's Bird by Bird , both of which offer instruction and advice -- in addition to works you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitless . " You might try something like Stephen King suggests in his excellent On Writing " McMillan recommends . " He says to read and write for four to six hours per day .... That sounds impossible for someone with a job and a family , to squeeze six hours per day into their schedules . But the closer you can get to that , the better . " Though King talks specifically about novelists , the approach translates to any genre . </p> Evart , Mich. , resident Axie Barclay chose a more structured technique . As an alternative to an MFA , which she considered too costly and time-consuming , the dairy worker and freelance writer embarked on " ambitious projects of reading and writing , consuming copious amounts of literature , and trying to write a poem or flash-fiction piece daily . " As a motivated , self-taught student , she noted that " making my own curriculum , so to speak , was fairly easy . " </p> Whatever your approach , I recommend a two-semester syllabus , like I used , to create measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suit everyone -- and that 's OK . Make your program bend and shape around you . </p> 4 Humanize your program . Students in traditional MFA programs have a built-in audience for readings , brainstorming sessions , and general industry chatter . With a little imagination , do-it-yourselfers can create similar opportunities for themselves -- or , according to Matt Stewart , author of the novel The French Revolution , perhaps even better ones . Stewart , who was already disciplined enough to write every day before getting rejected from 11 MFA programs , takes advantage of his surroundings . " I 'm fortunate to live in San Francisco , " he says , " which is overflowing with terrific literary events -- it can be very distracting , actually-and a sincere , supportive community that rolls out the red carpet for newbie writers . I ca n't imagine how an MFA program could improve on this . " </p> Freelance writer Lisa Sinicki , who decided against the MFA route because of time and finances , has found similar success in engaging with like-minded peers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer conferences , taken an in-person local class as well as online courses , and joined a writing group . " I 've tried to seek out the best teachers I can , and have selected programs based on what I feel is the next thing I need to improve my writing , " she says , noting that her commitment has paid off in the form of published work . She asks other writers for recommendations and , when she finds a teacher she likes , extends the relationship via private coaching . </p> Additionally , many schools hold public lectures , panels and talks that are free or low-cost . Audience members are frequently able to ask questions and mingle with speakers at these events . Come with a notebook and inquiries . </p> 5 Market your thesis . So you 've finished your program and have a nice , shiny manuscript . Congratulations ! But what 's that -- the publishing world is n't exactly reaching out to grab what you know is the next New York Times bestseller , namely your book ? Bummer . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , an attention-grabbing approach might be more advantageous in today 's climate . ( To those who think " gimmicky " diminishes the value of the work , I ask : Would you rather be the published author who used a gimmick or the unpublished author who did n't ? ) </p> Stewart knows this firsthand . He looked at popular culture for inspiration to sell The French Revolution and began sharing snippets of his work via Twitter , a practice that gained traction and got him a deal with Soft Skull Press . " As a nobody , it was critical for me to build some literary street cred by getting into bookstores and landing reviews , " he notes . " Alas , it 's still really hard to pull that off without a traditional publisher . I think that 'll change , but until it does , I 'd encourage writers to find new ways to attract agents and publishers -- whether that 's through technology or building a platform through easy-to-hit channels ( church , veterans groups , professional societies ) or something nobody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let rejection slow you down . </p> Getting a traditional MFA is not without its merits ( hello , diploma as wall art ! ) , but it also is n't a guaranteed gateway to fame and fortune . To some , it even borders on extravagant . " An MFA degree is not something I would ever recommend someone go into debt for , because in the end , it 's a luxury , " says John Temple , a journalism teacher at West Virginia University who polished Deadhouse : Life in a Coroner 's Office while studying for his MFA at the University of Pittsburgh . " There are other ways to learn to write . " </p> Indeed , there are . Published authors come from myriad training backgrounds , but they share a mixture of skills and commitment . Writers do n't need an MFA to be good at their craft , nor will an MFA -- traditional or self-guided -- fix discipline problems . But if they want it badly , they 'll make it happen . " There 's nothing like balancing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and writing to get a lot more efficient at everything , " Stewart muses . </p> When writers are ready to make a commitment to their craft , developing their own program allows them to eschew a predetermined agenda and keep their own best interests in mind .

@@4021641 The article " How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor , " by C. Ford Runge and Benjamin Senauer ( May/June 2007 ) , recycles the " food versus fuel " mythology that has been rebutted time and again . Despite the authors ' allegations , the facts are clear : U.S. corn is used to feed mostly animals , not people ; converting the starch from a portion of the U.S. corn crop into biofuels is an efficient way to reduce the United States ' dangerous dependence on imported oil ; and the recent firming of grain prices in the United States -- and therefore the world -- will help , not hurt , farmers in food-deficit nations . Most important , current production facilities for grain-based biofuels are a critical platform for launching the next generation of advanced cellulosic and waste-derived biofuel technologies . </P> To their credit , Runge and Senauer recognize that ending the United States ' suicidal dependence on fossil fuels will require a comprehensive energy policy . They are absolutely right : any solution to the world 's twin energy and climate crises will need to be broad and multifaceted . Existing energy sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better building codes and appliance standards , and market-driven demand-side management programs , such as ones that give utility companies profit incentives to increase energy efficiency and conservation . The playing field for renewable sources of energy -- such as wind , solar , and geothermal energy -- must be leveled with tax incentives that reduce the production costs for renewable-energy technologies . And the increasingly perilous costs of climate change ( which is caused by the unbridled use of fossil fuels ) must be stemmed with a binding international regulatory framework for greenhouse gases that includes the United States and China , the world 's largest emitters of such gases today . </P> Unfortunately , Runge and Senauer distort the central role that biofuels will play in any such comprehensive solution , both in the United States and abroad . Far from starving the world 's poor , as they claim , biofuels can help the world meet its energy needs without jeopardizing food security . </P> The current generation of biofuels has significant environmental benefits . The U.S. federal policy that requires minimum levels of oxygenates in U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the use of biofuels -- two of the primary benefits that Senator Bob Dole and I sought when we successfully pushed for that policy in 1991 . The current generation of biofuels also helps reduce the emission of greenhouse gases . An interesting analysis released by the Natural Resources Defense Council last May showed that corn-based ethanol outperforms gasoline when the two fuels ' full production and use cycles are compared . Innovation in the biofuel industry is leading to even greater greenhouse gas reductions , regardless of the feedstock . </P> Runge and Senauer themselves argue that the next generation of biofuels will dramatically lessen greenhouse gases . But not content to highlight these benefits , the authors stack the deck by focusing on the costs of developing these fuels . The problem is that their cost predictions take no account of the effects of innovation or of policy proposals that appear likely to be implemented over the next several years ( and which they support ) . </P> One such proposal is for a U.S.-wide carbon cap-and-trade system , which would immediately provide an economic advantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlikely to come into being under the current president , most analysts believe that it will by 2012 . Another significant proposal is for new state and federal incentives for low-carbon fuels , such as the program now being implemented in California , which is set to take full effect by November 2008 . By mandating that a growing percentage of the market for transportation fuel be set aside for low-carbon fuels , such programs would unleash a tidal wave of private-sector investment and technological innovation that would ultimately bring about something of a low-carbon-fuel Manhattan Project . In stark contrast to the head-in-the-sand policies of the Bush administration , the example of these policies could serve as a beacon to the rest of the world and encourage similar behavior elsewhere , including in China and India . </P> Under either of these policies , both the costs associated with carbon-intensive fossil fuels and the incentives for innovation in low-carbon fuels would dramatically increase . Thus , it is reasonable to expect cellulose-based ethanol to be competitive far sooner than in ten years , the time frame predicted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debates about ethanol , I can attest that the critics of biofuels have often warned of a coming food crunch as a result of the competition for inputs needed to produce both food and fuel . One of the most memorable such predictions arose in 1980 , during my second term in Congress , in the form of a Worldwatch Institute pamphlet entitled " Food or Fuel : New Competition for the World 's Cropland . " I was among those who rebutted the argument , which was authored by Lester Brown , and predicted that U.S. farmers and technology would more than keep pace with demand not only for food and feed but also for fuel . Over the next several decades , the doomsayers were proved wrong : productivity gains for corn averaged nearly three percent per year , and the annual U.S. corn crop increased from approximately seven billion bushels in 1980 to nearly 12 billion bushels in 2006 . During most of that time , corn prices were far below the actual costs of corn production , and taxpayers spent billions in direct payments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food " policy . Last year , the Worldwatch Institute released a report warning of the potential effect of biofuels on food but highlighting , above all , their benefits for farmers and the climate . </P> In August 2005 , President George W. Bush signed the Renewable Fuel Standard Program into law , and U.S. ethanol production is now expected to approach eight billion gallons by next year . As the public 's attention has begun to focus on the need for alternatives to oil , the major oil companies have become concerned . Unsurprisingly , warnings of a looming food-fuel tradeoff have crept back into the national debate . </P> Yet I am convinced that just as the crunch never came during the past 25-plus years , it will not come now . </P> A recent analysis of the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' food pricing data by the National Corn Growers Association showed that annual inflation for a basket of corn-intensive foodstuffs , such as dairy products , chicken , and pork , was less than general annual food inflation . And so even though the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.98 per bushel in January 2006 to $3.76 per bushel in March 2007 , the increase has not been passed on to U.S. consumers of products such as milk , cheese , chicken , and pork . </P> There are a number of possible reasons for this ( none of which Runge and Senauer cite ) . One of them is that only about five percent of the U.S. corn crop is used directly for human food ; much of the remaining 95 percent is used to feed livestock . Another reason is that ruminant animals , such as beef and dairy cattle , get more nutritional value out of feed made from ethanol coproducts than out of other feed . The benefits are less great for mono-gastric animals , such as swine and poultry , but the market can still get the most bang for the bushel by converting the starch in corn into ethanol and then using the protein coproducts from ethanol plants for ruminants ' feed rations . </P> To be sure , short-term market gyrations will require adjustments , as was the case in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited by the authors . But this will be a short-lived challenge because the market will rapidly respond to the increased demand for corn by encouraging farmers to plant more of it . The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that there will be as many as 90 million acres of corn planted this year in the United States and tens of millions of acres more planted in South America and elsewhere . If history is any indication , productivity per acre will increase year after year as technology improves the characteristics of seeds , including their starch content and ability to ferment . And in the medium term , of course , feedstocks other than corn , including nonfood cellulose , will become increasingly important as inputs for biofuels . </P> The legislation promoting a low-carbon fuel standard now being considered by Congress will attract investment for next-generation facilities that convert animal waste and other waste ( replacing fossil fuel inputs ) into biogas and biofertilizers . As energy costs rise , farmers will increasingly rely on low- and no-till cultivation techniques . And as their incomes improve , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques . An acre of corn , one of the rare plant species to use a carbon-dioxide-efficient photosynthesis system , removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than does an acre of mature Amazonian rain forest , and next-generation biofuel technologies -- including those using nonfood cellulosic feedstocks -- will increasingly contribute to the critically important goal of reducing , as the author Michael Pollan has put it , humans ' " carbon footprint . " </P> Next-generation feedstocks in other countries will also be important . Runge and Senauer sound the alarm about the potential use of cassava -- an important foodstuff -- for biodiesel , but cassava is far from being the most promising feed-stock for biodiesel in developing countries . In fact , oil from jatropha , a nonfood plant that grows in wastelands , is widely used in India , where it is the main ingredient in the 15-20 percent biodiesel fuel that powers the trains running from New Delhi to Mumbai . According to the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi , a hectare of jatropha can produce four times as much fuel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dominican Republic , Haiti , and several African states , have begun to sow jatropha for future use in biodiesel . </P> Like at no other time in history , the planet faces energy and climate crises . Resolving them will require a comprehensive and well-reasoned set of policies . Those choices must be based on sound analysis -- not hyperbole and the hollow recitation of discredited doomsday prophecies . </P> Runge and Senauer Reply Senator Tom Daschle 's comments reflect his longtime commitment to promoting corn-based ethanol as a member of Congress and now as a lobbyist for the ethanol industry . Whatever our differences with him over biofuels , they are not about politics ; we supported his last race for senator from South Dakota . Nor are our differences due to a lack of familiarity with agriculture . We have spent careers in Minnesota analyzing agricultural trade and its impact on the environment and on markets for food . Finally , we agree with Daschle that corn-based ethanol will be at best a partial solution to our current energy needs . </P> But we disagree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fed mostly to animals with few implications for people , that the conversion of corn into biofuel is an efficient way to reduce the United States ' dependence on foreign oil , that higher grain prices will help farmers in food-deficit nations , and that the current corn-based ethanol industry will be a platform for the next generation of biofuels , which will be made from cellulose and waste materials . </P> First , we , too , know that meat-producing animals eat more than half of the U.S. corn crop . But people do eat chicken , eggs , pork , steak ; drink milk ; and consume foods containing cornmeal , corn oil , and corn sweeteners . U.S. consumers spend over 20 percent of their food budgets on meat , eggs , and dairy . And the share of the corn crop used to produce ethanol will rise from less than ten percent in 2004 to an expected 20-25 percent of the crop next year . As more acres are devoted to corn , fewer acres are available for other types of dairy feed , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green beans . As a result , milk and vegetable prices are rising . And as acres are bid away from soybeans and turned over to corn , the price of soybean-based feed is also increasing , adding to the pressure on meat prices . In March 2007 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast that demand for ethanol would push the prices of poultry , pork , and beef higher . The Wells Fargo economist Michael Swanson noted in June 2007 that the rising costs of corn and soybean feed also " have a direct and significant impact " on " oils , cereals and bakery products . " Corn-based ethanol , Swanson concluded , " is indeed responsible for the increased rate of food inflation " ( even though it is not its sole cause ) . </P> Second , even if every single one of the roughly 90 million acres in the United States devoted to growing corn goes into ethanol -- leaving none for feed , exports , or other uses -- corn-based ethanol would meet only 12-15 percent of the country 's transportation fuel needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foreign petroleum today is marginal at best . </P> Third , higher grain prices are translating into an increase in the prices of staple foods around the world . For some , this effect could be another way beside trade liberalization to raise the incomes of poor farmers . But the ethanol boom 's distorting effects on commodity prices are hardly a substitute for expanded market opportunities for farmers in food-deficit nations . By definition , a food-deficit nation buys more food than it sells and hence is negatively affected by price increases . Most of the three billion people living on less than $2 a day are subsistence farmers with little or no surplus to sell or urban slum dwellers who consume but do not produce food . As consumers , they lose . Higher prices may induce more grain production abroad , but unless wealthy nations agree to import this grain by granting expanded market access to poor producer nations , it will be of no help to them . Finally , as the need for corn for ethanol production cuts more and more into U.S. corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it has a tremendous comparative advantage ( corn ) for a product in which it has a comparative disadvantage ( ethanol ) , especially vis--vis Brazil . This disadvantage is precisely the reason the United States has a 54-cent-a-gallon ethanol import tariff . </P> Fourth , Daschle 's argument that corn-based ethanol will be a platform for cellulose- and waste-based fuels is undercut by three observations . For one thing , although cellulose from switchgrass holds promise , who will plant it while the price of corn is above $3.50 or more a bushel , as it is now ? U.S. corn growers and the ethanol industry did not spend 30 years paying the campaign bills of members of Congress such as Senators Daschle and Bob Dole ( both of whom now lobby for ethanol at the same firm ) in order to give away the store to grass producers . If , moreover , the rapid technological development of cellulosic alternatives is to be promoted without " me too " subsidies matching those given to the corn-based ethanol industry , then the incentives currently favoring corn-based ethanol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production mandates ) should be lowered . Giving huge grants to noncompetitive biomass production , rather than investing in basic research and development for conservation and renewable sources of energy , only pays down the cost of the inefficiency of that biomass . </P> On August 9 , 2006 , Senator Daschle noted in a speech before the American Coalition for Ethanol that advocates of corn-based ethanol " have always been acting more in the national interest than in self-interest . " In truth , the ethanol industry is a textbook example of how agriculture and industry combine to influence Congress into transferring taxpayer and consumer dollars to wealthy and influential special interests . </P> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) </P> </P> </P> By Tom Daschle </P> TOM DASCHLE , Special Policy Adviser at the law firm Alston &; Bird and Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress , is a former Democratic Senator from South Dakota and former Senate Majority Leader . </P> 
@@4071441 Title : Measuring Dignity in Care for Older People <p> Authors : Helen Magee , Suzanne Parsons and Janet Askham <p> Institution : The Picker Institute Europe for Help the Aged <p> L : OBJECTIVES The value of this study is revealed by a perceptive remark from the authors : " It is easier to make pronouncements about dignity than to ensure that dignified care happens . " This is particularly the case for anyone responsible for measuring or assessing dignity in care . <p> It is noted , as a preliminary , that dignified care in health and social care continues to be especially problematic for older people . The researchers heard many reasons for this , ranging from the priority given to targets and budgets which sometimes undermines dignified care to what others see as the replacement of compassionate nursing care for more technically skilled nurses . Others cite the power of ageism in society and ageist attitudes among staff . <p> This study reviewed qualitative research that had explored older people 's perceptions of dignified care ( or the opposite ) across settings of hospital , care homes and home care . It asked older people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicators for dignity in care . The researchers reviewed existing measures and indicators within a set of dignity domains identified by Help the Aged . <p> This work was lent urgency by the government 's focus on dignity and by the changes under way in the creation of the Care Quality Commission . Many older people 's groups are keen to see that the commission shows a strong commitment to social care and is not sidetracked by NHS-related issues . <p> L : METHODS This five-month study set out to identify a group of indicators that could measure the extent to which older people are treated with dignity and respect by health and social care professionals . <p> The research team carried out an electronic search to find qualitative studies that explored older people 's perceptions of dignity in care in hospitals , care homes and domiciliary care . To supplement this they held focus group discussions with care home residents , home care service users , people who had recently returned home from hospital and carers . <p> Eleven interviews were held with key informants from organisations which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , for example , the Royal College of Nursing or British Society of Geriatrics represent older people would doubtless be questioned by older people 's groups and campaigners . <p> In the context of these sources of information , the research team identified and developed indicators for nine domains , looking at questionnaires , assessment tools and benchmarks that are used to assess dignity in care . Many of these related to hospital care and treatment , some to care homes but few to home care . Indeed , the evidence is limited about social care , particularly new forms of social care which focus less on tasks and their completion and more on personally agreed outcomes . <p> L : FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS There are many interesting findings in this study , including the results of further analysis of older people 's responses to the 2007 National Inpatient Survey , focusing on hospital care and treatment . <p> What is significant is the finding that over-70s often gave more positive answers than younger older people when asked whether they were treated with respect and dignity . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , pain control and cleanliness . In contrast , the qualitative studies , when older people were interviewed in depth and often after they had left hospital , found numerous instances where people expressed concerns and gave instances of things going wrong . <p> Perhaps both methods should be used to enable these experiences to be heard . <p> This study focused on dignity in care in hospitals and care homes and there is less about social care . One section that covers most of these settings is that of personal care or practical assistance . <p> It is important to avoid confusion about the broad term personal care . The researchers note that the term " personal care " was often confused with " personal hygiene " in health care settings ; in social care it can be defined more widely , almost as covering the same territory as social care itself . The researchers suggested renaming personal care " practical assistance " , although this was not discussed more widely . <p> Social care debates , for example , have taught us that if care work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking psychosocial interventions that often support people at home . Indicators of dignity in personal care might cover : <p> * Knowledge of an individual 's preferred lifestyle ( including clothing preferences , routines , pets , religious and cultural preferences ) and need to show respect for an individual 's preferred lifestyle , including the flexibility to meet a person 's needs . * Timetabling of services to suit the client . * Assistance that reflects individuals ' wishes . * Respectful delivery of care and support . * Support to maintain personal standards . * Regular information about changes to help and assistance . * Consistency of care workers . * Respect for property and possessions . * Enough time for home care visits . * Regular monitoring of the service . All this is familiar to people working in social care or commissioning services , but there is little recognition that fulfilling many of these domains will need investment . Personalisation is one way to enhance dignity in such transactions and fresh indicators may need to be considered for this new world . <p> L : RECOMMENDATIONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should use a set of indicators to measure dignity that includes common " core " elements , relevant to any care setting , together with indicators specific to a particular setting . <p> They recommend that indicators should be part of the early work of the new Care Quality Commission ( CQC ) so it can think about the use of indicators in its secondary legislation , regulations and compliance criteria . They advise further research to explore the perceptions that older people and professionals hold about dignity in care across various settings . <p> However , the researchers also note that many of those responding to their enquiries in the telephone interviews and focus groups sympathised with the pressures facing frontline staff . They say that if practitioners are to deliver care with respect and dignity then they too must be treated with respect and dignity , in contrast to the more usual situation of being poorly paid and feeling undervalued . <p> In a trenchant statement they propose that , before creating further indicators with which to measure their performance , it might be worthwhile considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the needs of older people more effectively . <p> This challenge draws attention to the broader context in which care takes place and the potential for thinking about dignity beyond regulatory systems . Some see dignity as fundamental to human rights . The potential for human rights legislation to help change systems and practices is illustrated in a study of instances where raising questions about human rights seemed to promote action to restore dignity in care . <p> The British Institute for Human Rights ' report , Changing Lives , makes clear the scope of the act to strengthen the ability of people to secure the best possible standard of services from public bodies and the right to be treated with respect , dignity and fairness . It argues that , because the government 's expressed purpose in introducing the Human Rights Act 1998 was to promote a culture of respect for human rights , it is important that public sector staff work within human rights standards and principles . They have responsibilities to ensure that services , in-house or commissioned , deliver on respect , autonomy , fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " still a long way to go , and many people , particularly the most vulnerable , remain in need of the protections afforded by the Human Rights Act " . <p> Lack of dignity was a common thread in the breaches of the act that this study reported and the examples provided are inspiring learning points for practitioners . <p> L : LINKS AND RESOURCES * Measuring Dignity in Care for Older People , Help the Aged at www.helptheaged.org.uk * Cass E , Robbins D and Richardson A , 2006 , Dignity in Care , Social Care Institute for Excellence * The Department of Health in England is running a Dignity in Care campaign ( **71;4428;TOOLONG ) .

@@4159241 Essentials # As part of an occasional series on communication , we look at the benefits of - and the barriers to - communicating with external agencies , and what can happen when it goes wrong . And if you missed ' Communicating with the practice team ' you can find it online at practicenurse.co.uk # The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place . Attributed to the playwright George Bernard Shaw , how those words ring true . Anyone working in primary care can relate to this sentiment but why does this happen ? And what impact does this have on patient care ? # PRACTICE NURSES ' ROLE # Communication with outside organisations and care providers is an integral part of the practice nurse 's role . Primary care is n't an organisation that stands alone , indeed it is a portal to accessing appropriate services and referral pathways to provide enhanced care for our patients . It is vital , therefore , that we have not only an understanding of the wider community from which our patients can benefit but also that we ensure that we know how to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Practice Foundation General Practice Nurse competencies framework stipulates that practice nurses need to have an understanding of the interface with other practitioners and agencies and ' work effectively with other disciplines to enhance patient care ' .1 Moreover , the recently revised NMC Code reiterates that nurses need to ' act in partnership ' with our patients to access health and social care.2 # OUTSIDE AGENCIES # So who do we need to be able to communicate with , beyond the four walls of our surgeries ? ( See Box 1 ) Looking at a typical morning 's list it is evident that we need to communicate with a wide variety of disciplines and agencies in order to carry out our job effectively . There 's the young mother who is returning for her swab results which are not back yet so you will need to contact the laboratory ; the gentleman recently diagnosed with diabetes is keen to access the DESMOND self-management education programme you 've discussed with him ; there 's the elderly lady living alone with dementia and her daughter needs to know what support is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know which way to turn ; the patient with a deteriorating post-operative wound really needs to be seen by the district nurses at the weekend . All these patients need us to act on their behalf , with their permission and collaboration , and ensure that we communicate with the appropriate agencies to enable a continuity of care . # HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE ? # There are many ways in which we can communicate with external agencies but it 's knowing the correct referral or pathway . Sometimes it may be a phone call , fax or email . Another time it is speaking with the GP to instigate an ultrasound referral for a patient . It may be that the district nurse has just come to the surgery so you can speak to them about the dressings to be done at the weekend although this may then need to be followed up more officially through the ' proper channels ' . Clearly there are some referral pathways that are relatively straightforward . CCG websites can be an extremely useful resource for finding information for accessing a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rehabilitation to Falls Assessment referrals. # Communicating through multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) meetings can be a hugely beneficial way of disseminating information amongst a number of professionals for specific patient groups . Holding monthly MDT meetings to discuss , for example , the frail and elderly patients in your practice with the GPs , district nurses , community psychiatric nurse and social care personnel allows a team approach to manage the care of these vulnerable and ' at risk ' patients and to avoid hospitalisation . Equally , meeting regularly with the palliative care team , as part of the Gold Standards Framework , to review patients on the palliative care register enhances communication between the relevant agencies involved in a patient 's end of life care . # INTEGRATED CARE FRAMEWORK AND SHARED RECORDS # Integrated care models are emerging between primary , community and secondary care for the management of chronic disease to improve the delivery of care to patients . The management of diabetes through integrated care , in particular , is an example of improvements in the communication between services to provide a high quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework allows wider access to specialist expertise by the primary care team and support and advice from outreach teams delivered locally . Intrinsic to this pathway of care is the integrated IT system that allows Enhanced Data Sharing ( EDS ) of patient records between primary and secondary care . It enables rapid communication and referral and allows each discipline to view each other 's records to make the best clinical decisions for that patient . Such an improved system of communication and forging links between primary and specialist care enables more complex care to be given locally together with greater access to education for both patient and practice nurses alike . This is a real example of where technology can enhance patient care through better communication . # Gaining patient consent to data sharing in this way is paramount before this can occur and patients need to be reassured that they have complete control as to how or indeed if their information is shared . It may also be pertinent to distinguish between this type of Enhanced Data Sharing and the electronic Summary Care Records which are used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing patient information can be somewhat confusing and easily misunderstood.4 # BENEFITS OF GOOD COMMUNICATION # The ultimate benefit of good communication is , naturally , to the patient - either to provide additional support , referral for further care , engage in education or simply to find out pathology results . Knowing local pathways and local information is certainly key to communication . For example , what is the local procedure for an abnormal cytology result ? Whose responsibility is it to follow up that result ? Having adequate resources and updated policies and procedures within the practice are essential to enable a smooth flow of communication externally . Who actually sends the fax to the Malaria Reference Laboratory about your query about malaria chemoprophylaxis ? Do you confirm that it has been sent and is it then documented in the notes ? Do you assume it has been received ? # Having face-to-face contact with certain specialists such as the specialist nurse at the renal unit or the local school nurse often aids communication - putting a face to a name means they are therefore more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit every department and service sometimes opportunities do arise through study days and departmental open days where you can get to meet professionals from other disciplines . Yes , we live in a world of efficient technology which has improved some areas of communication beyond belief but having personal contact with your district nurses , health visitors and midwives completes the picture . Even though you might have to undertake the appropriate paperwork and submit an official referral document for , let 's say , a mental health referral , a personal chat with your Community Psychiatric Nurse as well can make a huge difference to the patient concerned . # Recognised secure email systems , supported by the NHS , are replacing traditional methods of communication and as a result are proving to be a safe , rapid and cost-effect way of communicating with other agencies . For example , referrals for investigative procedures are often expedited , information between GPs and community teams can be shared more efficiently and accurately and hospices can advise primary care teams immediately when a patient is discharged to ensure a continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION # A referral to the DESMOND programme for example may simply be a fax or electronic transfer to the appropriate agency . But sometimes the problem is remembering to do it at the end of a busy morning 's work . Or maybe you 're not quite sure how to do it and intend to ask someone and come back to it later . Then do n't . Or , as has happened , the fax number has been changed without anyone in the practice realising it , and the referrals do n't arrive at the intended destination . And if that is the case , where has that patient information ended up ? # Just not knowing how to do things can be a barrier to communicating with external services but it is certainly no excuse . Ignorance or inexperience wo n't stand up at a hearing . Frustratingly , trying to speak to other professionals on the telephone is not always straightforward . How many times have your tried to telephone someone such as the continence nurse or the health visitor with limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so leave a message on their answer machine . They return your call but you are now with a patient so you are unable to take it . You try again once your patient has left and it 's the answerphone again . You then have a day off and miss their return call . And so it goes on . # WHEN COMMUNICATION GOES WRONG # As much as good communication benefits the patient , clearly poor or absent communication is inevitably going to be detrimental to a greater or lesser extent . What happens when an HbA1c reported by the laboratory confirms a diagnosis of diabetes and that is never communicated to the patient ? What are the consequences when a referral to secondary care ' goes missing ' and the patient does n't like to bother the doctor to find out why they have n't heard from the hospital ? And then there 's the unthinkable . We do have to remind ourselves of the most devastating of consequences in failure to communicate with multi-agency professionals when safeguarding children and adults from harm . Sadly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributory factor when abuse goes unchecked.5 6 When confronted with the thought that poor communication can at its absolute worst result in such tragic consequences it seems trite to blame lack of time , tiredness , feeling overworked or the general mayhem of primary care . # Even in less serious offences , lost DESMOND referrals could culminate in delayed intensive education for these patients and subsequently they could miss out on the benefits of the legacy effect of good early control of their diabetes to reduce long term complications . Being unaware of local knowledge can impact significantly on how we communicate . For example , referral pathways for abnormal cervical cytology can differ from area to area . It may be that a practice nurse working at one surgery has been used to the system of direct referral from the local Cervical Screening Programme , whereas at her new surgery referral needs to be made by the practice . It is an opportunity for error . # In a report last year , NHS England raised concerns about the risks to patient safety on discharge from hospital due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a practice nurse 's perspective , a lack of discharge information may be having no advice regarding individualised wound care , the duration for the continuation of antithrombotic agents , whether there is ongoing care from the community nursing team , or a lack of instructions for specific medical devices to name but a few - all of which can directly affect patient care . Communication between the two sectors is therefore vital to protect patients ' safety and ongoing care and such a report emphasises the consequences of poor communication . # COMMUNICATION AND DOCUMENTATION # Sometimes the way in which we communicate with external agencies and services automatically saves a record in the patient 's notes . Many practices use electronic forms for referral to the diabetic foot clinic or community services , for example . Evidence is then left in a patient 's notes that contact or referral has been made to a specific service , when that occurred and by whom . Details of other means of communication , such as phone calls , need to be added to a patient 's records contemporaneously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the documentation of failed attempts at making contact with a specific service , such as having to leave messages on the occupational therapist 's answer-machine or repeated unanswered calls to Child Health . Accurate record keeping is essential to nursing practice , but also on another practical level , it can provide a valuable ' aide-memoire ' when you ca n't remember the name of the staff nurse from the Renal Unit from whom you need to seek further advice that day or indeed whether a colleague has received a phone call from the school nurse in your absence . # SELF-REFERRAL # Communicating with other services may sometimes be a question of pointing the patient in the right direction . Many services , such as physiotherapy and some mental health services , do not require a referral from primary care but encourage self-referral from patients themselves . Practice nurses need to be aware of what is available locally and know how to advise patients so they can access such services . Indeed , the services themselves need to ensure that updated information about self-referral is communicated to primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of their services . # TIME # Very often our communication with other agencies feels like an ' add-on ' to our daily work . During your shift you acquire additional things that need to be done for the patients you have seen , be it seeking advice from the specialist stoma nurse , a query with Child Health about a specific child 's immunisation records , a discussion with the NaTHNaC specialist travel nurses about a traveller 's complicated itinerary . So at what point in our day do we actually get the opportunity to manage this successfully ? # Does it need to be said ? Time is essential to good communication . We need time to undertake the phone call , complete the online referral , speak to the health visitor , fax the podiatry form . Not just time , but uninterrupted time . Where our focus is undisturbed . Or in reality are there half-started jobs that fail to be completed as colleagues and patients alike invade any moments of contemplation ?

@@4005241 Controversy exists concerning the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation . The present study used a cross-sectional design to examine social cognitive predictors of creatine use versus non-use among 148 male , undergraduate , recreational resistance trainers . Seventy participants ( 47.3% ) reported creatine use . Creatine users had higher self-efficacy for resistance-training with creatine , t ( 146 ) = 4.98 , p < .001 , higher positive outcome expectancies for improved workout performance , t ( 146 ) = 2.3 7 , p = .019 , and lower negative outcome expectancies for creatine use , t ( 146 ) = 4.90 , p < .001 . No significant differences were found for self-efficacy for resistance training without creatine or negative outcome expectancies for improved workout performance . Logistic regression analysis revealed that social cognitive variables accounted for 25 % of the variance in creatine use . The results lay the groundwork for the understanding of performance enhancing dietary supplement use from a theoretical , social cognitive perspective . <p> Creatine is one of the most popular performance enhancing supplements among college students ( Williams &; Anderson , 2000 ) , and has received recent attention from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 ; Shaifali , 1998 ; Smith , 2000 ) . Despite this popularity , controversy exists concerning the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation ; roughly equal evidence exists supporting positive effects and supporting null effects of supplementation on performance ( Demant &; Rhodes , 1999 ; Graham &; Hatton , 1999 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky , 1998a ; Williams &; Branch , 1998 ) . Numerous anecdotal accounts illustrate adverse side effects , such as kidney dysfunction , effects on the body 's creatine and insulin production , diarrhea , gastrointestinal pain , muscle cramping , and dehydration ( Benzi , 2000 ; Graham &; Hatton , 1999 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky , 1998b ; Poortmans &; Francaux , 2000 ) . In addition , Metzl et al . ( 2001 ) hypothesize that creatine may be a gateway drug to other more harmful performance enhancing substances such as dehydroepiandrosterone ( i.e. , DHEA ) and androstenedione ( i.e. , andro ; King et al. , 1999 ) . <p> Although laboratory studies of creatine 's efficacy are numerous , field studies of creatine supplementation patterns have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resistance trainers , who are the target of marketing strategies that emphasize creatine 's ability to increase body mass ( Benzi , 2000 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky , 1998b ; Poortmans &; Francaux , 2000 ; Williams &; Branch , 1998 ) and appear to be a major consumer group in the creatine market ( Demant &; Rhodes , 1999 ) . Moreover , the present authors found no studies that examine relationships between psychological variables and performance enhancing supplement use in this population . Previous creatine studies have examined expectations ( Labotz &; Smith , 1999 ) and perceptions ( Greenwood et al. , 2000 ; Juhn , O'Kane , &; Vinci , 1999 ; LaBotz &; Smith , 1999 ; Ray et al. , 2001 ; Sheppard et al. , 2000 ; Schilling et al. , 2001 ) of the positive and negative effects of creatine supplementation among users , but have not looked at differences between creatine users and non-users with respect to these psychological variables .

In working to understand creatine use among recreational weight trainers , the present study examines differences between creatine users and non-users with respect to psychological variables that are theorized to precede behavior . <p> Social cognitive theory ( SCT ; Bandura , 1986 ) provides a useful theoretical framework for understanding creatine use by addressing its specific behavioral , personal , and environmental influences . That is , self-efficacy and outcome expectancies specifically related to the use of creatine can help us understand why some resistance trainers use creatine while others do not . <p> Self-efficacy is defined as belief in one 's ability to take certain actions to produce desired attainments ( Bandura , 1997 ) . In the present study , improvement of resistance-training performance is the attainment , while creatine use is one course of action that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resistance-training self-efficacy is broken down into two components : self-efficacy with creatine , and self-efficacy without creatine . Creatine users are expected to have higher self-efficacy with creatine than non-users . However , according to SCT , use of medications can undermine self-efficacy if successes are ascribed to medication rather than to personal capabilities ( Bandura , 1997 , see p. 274 ) . Therefore , creatine users are expected to have lower self-efficacy without creatine than non-users . <p> Outcome Expectancies -- the positive and negative outcomes expected as a result of producing desired attainments depend on efficacy beliefs and serve as incentives and disincentives for behavior ( Bandura , 1997 ) . In this study , outcome expectancies reflect the interactive relationship between perceived likelihood of outcomes and the subjective values placed on those outcomes ( Bandura , 1997 ; Rodgers &; Brawley , 1991 ) . Specifically , positive and negative outcomes of improved workout performance , as well as negative outcomes directly tied to creatine use are considered . <p> In summary , it is expected that creatine users will have higher self-efficacy with creatine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative outcome expectancies than non-users . In addition , it is expected that social cognitive variables will predict current status as creatine user or non-user . Finally , although no formal hypotheses were tested , descriptive data concerning creatine use patterns , source of information , and use of other performance enhancing dietary supplements was collected in an attempt to further understand creatine use . Method <p> Participants <p> Participants were a convenience sample of 148 male undergraduate students enrolled in psychology courses at a large mid-Atlantic university , recruited via a research recruitment folder containing a brief description of the study and a sign up sheet . Only students who resistance-trained at least twice a week to improve muscle development , gain strength , or increase muscle mass for non-professional purposes were recruited . Creatine was not mentioned in the recruitment folder . Participants earned extra credit in the psychology classes for participating in the study . Participants were excluded from the study if they did not report any resistance training ( n = 2 ) , did not provide complete data ( n = 6 ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; i.e. , non-recreational goal of resistance training ) . Participants had a mean age of 19.37 ( SD = 1.52 ) and a mean BMI of 24.29 ( SD = 3.42 ) . Participants were 75% Caucasian . <p> Procedures <p> Participants met for one hour in a classroom to complete an anonymous questionnaire packet . Instructions were read aloud for each of the individual scales within the packet . In addition , the first item of each scale was read aloud , and further clarification was provided if requested . <p> Measures <p> Background information and supplement use . This questionnaire assessed participant age , height , weight , ethnicity , and intercollegiate sports participation . With respect to creatine use , participants were first asked whether or not they had ever heard of creatine . Next , participants were asked to indicate whether or not they had ever used creatine . Those who had used creatine were asked to indicate the duration of use and the number of cycles of use with at least two weeks between periods of use . Participants were then asked to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatine ) . To encourage truthfulness , participants were asked not to report illegal drug-use . Finally , two items assessing source of information asked participants to identify initial source of information about creatine and source of most information about creatine . <p> Self-efficacy . Items assessing SCT variables were preceded by a single item asking participants to indicate how they determine that their workout performance has improved by completing the sentence : " My workout performance would be improved if ... " Participants were told to refer to this definition of improved workout performance to aid them in responding to the SCT items . <p> Next , participants were asked to respond to one self-efficacy without creatine item : " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance without using creatine ... " and two self-efficacy with creatine items : " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance faster by using creatine ... " and " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance even more by using creatine ... " ( italics in original ) . Participants responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all confident ) to 100 ( extremely confident ) . Because participants were allowed to personally define improved workout performance , multiple item self-efficacy scales were not necessary . Previous studies have shown that single item self-efficacy scales are effective for measuring exercise self-efficacy when the attainment is clearly defined ( Carboni , Burke , Joyner , Hardy , &; Blom , 2002 ; Clark &; Dodge , 1999 ; Clark &; Nothwehr , 1999 ; Desharnais , Bouillon , &; Godin , 1986 ; Sharpe &; Connell , 1992 ) . <p> Outcome expectancies . Participants responded to three types of outcome expectancy items developed with the aid of qualitative data obtained in a pilot study ( Williams &; Anderson , 2000 ) . Positive improved workout expectancies included 17 items reflecting the positive physical , social , and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from attaining improved workout performance . Examples of positive improved workout expectancy items include : " I will increase my muscle strength ... " " I will be admired for my physical appearance ... " and " I will improve how I feel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting the negative physical , social , and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from attaining improved workout performance . Examples of negative improved workout expectancy items include : " I will experience unwanted muscle soreness ... " " My friends will think I am overly obsessed with weight-lifting ... " and " I will discover my performance limitations .... " Finally , Negative creatine use expectancies included 10 items reflecting the negative physical , social and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from the use of creatine . Examples of negative creatine use expectancy items include : " I will experience muscle cramps ... " " My friends will criticize me ... " and " I will feel that I am doing something unnatural to my body ... " <p> Participants were asked to rate the " Likelihood " of each outcome on a scale from 0 ( not at all likely ) to 100 ( extremely likely ) . Before proceeding to the next item , participants were also asked to rate the " Importance " of each outcome on a scale from 0 ( not at all important ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , responses to " Likelihood " and " Importance " questions were multiplied , and the resulting products were divided by 100 to yield an item score ranging from 0 to 100 . All of the outcome expectancy item scores were subjected to principle axis factoring with oblique rotation to investigate the factor structure of the items . Results yielded three factor-based scales that were consistent with the original grouping of the items . Item scores were then averaged for each scale to yield positive improved workout expectancy ( = .91 ) , negative improved workout expectancy ( = .86 ) , and negative creatine use expectancy ( = .82 ) scale scores . Data Analyses and Results <p> Descriptive Statistics and Preliminary Analyses <p> Creatine use . Of 148 participants , 5 ( 3.4 % ) had not heard of creatine , 70 ( 47.3 % ) reported having used creatine at some time , and 78 ( 52.7 % ) reported never having used creatine . Among creatine users 9 ( 12.9 % ) were of minority status , while 28 non-users ( 35.9 % ) were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 ( 28.6 % ) had used it for more than 2 months , 30 ( 42.9 % ) for 1 to 2 months , 11 ( 15.7 % ) for 2 to 4 weeks , 7 ( 10.0 % ) for 1 to 2 weeks , and 2 ( 2.9 % ) for less than I week . With respect to cycles of use , 22 ( 31.4 % ) reported 1 cycle , 19 ( 27.1% ) reported 2 cycles , 14 ( 20.0 % ) reported 3 cycles , 3 ( 4.3 % ) reported 4 cycles , and 10 ( 14.3 % ) reported more than 4 cycles . <p> Source of Information . Sources of first knowledge of creatine and most information about creatine across creatine use are shown in Table 1 . A majority of both creatine users ( n = 48 , 70.6 % ) and non-users ( n = 40 , 60.6 % ) indicated that friends and family was the first source of knowledge about creatine . The highest number of creatine users ( n = 20 , 29.4 % ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatine , while the majority of nonusers ( n = 37 , 55.2 % ) said friends and family was the source of most information about creatine . <p> Use of other performance enhancing supplements . Creatine users used more performance enhancing dietary supplements , other than creatine , than non-users , t ( 146 ) = 5.00 , p < .001 ( Table 2 ) . In addition , a larger proportion of creatine users ( n = 47 , 67.1 % ) than non-users ( n = 21 , 26.9 % ) reported previous use of at least one other performance enhancing dietary supplement , / ( 1 , N = 148 ) = 22.52 , p < .001 . Table 3 displays the types of performance enhancing dietary supplements used by creatine users and non-users . Protein/amino acids were the most often used supplements by both creatine users and non-users . Of 11 participants reporting use of DHEA/andro , 10 ( 90.9 % ) were creatine users . <p> Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies . Mean ratings for self-efficacy and outcome expectancy variables across creatine use are presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which variables should be included in the logistic regression analysis . Creatine users were significantly higher on self-efficacy with creatine than non-users , t ( 146 ) = 4.98 , p < .001 . No significant differences were found between creatine users and non-users for self-efficacy without creatine , t ( 146 ) = .45 , p = .657 . Creatine users had significantly higher positive improved workout expectancies , t ( 146 ) = 2.37 , p = .019 , and lower negative creatine use expectancies , t ( 146 ) = 4.90 , p <.001 , than non-users . No significant differences were found between creatine users and non-users for negative improved workout expectancies , t ( 146 ) = .15 , p=.882 . <p> Sequential Logistic Regression Analysis <p> Based on the preliminary analyses , self-efficacy with creatine , positive improved workout expectancies , and negative creatine use expectancies were included in a sequential logistic regression analysis to predict status as either creatine user or non-user ( Table 4 ) . In accordance with social cognitive theory , self-efficacy with creatine was entered on the first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step ( Bandura , 1997 ) . Goodness-of-fit indices indicated that the model including the social cognitive variables was a better predictor of creatine use status than the constant-only model both on the first step , / ( 1 , N = 148 ) = 22.34 , p < .001 ; and the second step , / ( 3 , N = 148 ) = 39.24 , p < .001 , of the analysis . Strength of association for the model is indicated by correlations between predicted group membership based on the model and actual group membership ( Tabachnick &; Fidell , 2001 , see page 545 ) . The model accounted for 11.6 % of the variance in creatine use status on step one ( r = .34 ) , and 25.0 % of the variance in creatine use status on step two ( r = .50 ) . <p> The Wald statistic tests each logistic regression coefficient ( ) to determine whether or not each variable contributes uniquely to the model ( Table 4 ) . Results indicate that self-efficacy with creatine contributed uniquely to the model on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectancies also contributed uniquely to the model on step two ; however , positive improved workout expectancies did not . For those variables that contribute uniquely to the model , odds ratios provide a more easily interpretable index of the magnitude of each variable 's unique contribution . Prior to calculating odds ratios , the predictor variables were converted to standard scores . Thus , odds ratios reflect the increase/decrease in the odds of creatine use status given a change in one standard deviation in the predictor variable , controlling for all other variables in the model ( Table 4 ) . On step one the odds ratio indicated that participants were 2.36 times as likely ( 136 % more likely ) to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in self-efficacy with creatine . On the second step , the odds ratio for self-efficacy with creatine decreased to 1.91 , indicating that some of the shared variance between self-efficacy with creatine and creatine use status was also accounted for by the outcome expectancy variables . The odds ratio for negative creatine use expectancies indicated that participants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in negative creatine use expectancies . Discussion <p> Consistent with SCT , creatine users had stronger beliefs in personal ability to enhance performance through creatine use . In addition , participants were 2.36 times as likely to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in self-efficacy with creatine . Self-efficacy with creatine continued to be a significant predictor of creatine use status after the outcome expectancy variables were added to the model , thus supporting the notion that self-efficacy continues to be a strong predictor even after outcome expectancies are controlled ( Bandura , 1997 ) . Creatine non-users did not have higher self-efficacy without creatine than creatine users . Instead , mean values for self-efficacy without creatine were high for both groups , suggesting that participants were all fairly confident that they could improve personal workout performance without creatine . <p> Negative creatine use expectancies had the strongest relationship with creatine use status among the outcome expectancy variables . Creatine users expected fewer negative outcomes from using creatine and deemed those outcomes less important than non-creatine users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome expectancies , participants were less than half as likely ( Odds Ratio = .45 ) to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in negative creatine use expectancies . Moreover , the increase in explained variance from step 1 to step 2 indicates that outcome expectancies explained unique variance in creatine use that was not accounted for by self-efficacy . Creatine users expected more positive outcomes as a result of improved workout performance and valued those outcomes more than non-creatine users . However , positive improved workout expectancies were not a significant predictor of creatine use status when self-efficacy and negative outcome expectancies were controlled . Finally , negative improved workout expectancies were not related to creatine use status . Instead , the mean for this variable was relatively low across all participants indicating that resistance trainers do not expect many negative outcomes of improved workout performance . <p> Descriptive results indicate pervasive exposure to creatine in this population as evidenced by the percentage of those who had heard of creatine ( 96.6 % ) and the rate of use ( 47.3 % ) . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male , undergraduate , recreational resistance-trainers participated in varsity high school sports and obtained information about creatine from athletic trainers ( Williams &; Anderson , 2000 ) , the present data suggest that information about creatine is more often obtained through friends and family or through magazines than through professionals such as athletic trainers . Information gleaned from these sources may become distorted or exaggerated leading consumers to make decisions about creatine use that are not based in fact . Exaggerated claims of the effectiveness of creatine may indirectly affect creatine use by influencing self-efficacy and outcome expectancies . Finally , creatine users had used more performance enhancing supplements than non-creatine users , and more creatine users than non-users reported previous use of more harmful supplements , namely DHEA and andro ( King et al. , 1999 ) . <p> The present study lays the groundwork for the understanding of performance enhancing dietary supplement use from a theoretical , social cognitive perspective . Results suggest that SCT variables are useful in differentiating between creatine users and non-users . However , interpretations based on the sequential logistic regression analysis must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although social cognitive variables are theorized to determine future behavior , current self-efficacy judgments and outcome expectancies are based in part on past behavior ( Bandura , 1997 ) ; therefore , to more clearly understand how self-efficacy , outcome expectancies , and information sources influence behavior ( i.e. , creatine use ) , longitudinal designs are preferred . Moreover , the use of a convenience sample in the present study limits the generalizability of the findings . Research employing random and broader sampling ( e.g. , high school students , college graduates , and female resistance trainers ) is needed to understand how SCT operates to influence creatine use in these populations . Finally , as the market for dietary supplements continues to grow , more research is needed that examines theoretical determinants of a wide range of supplement use , including more harmful performance enhancing drugs .

@@4002841 The Middle of the Twentieth Century witnessed the destruction of colonial systems in many parts of Asia and Africa . In the aftermath of the Second World War , newly independent Arab states seemed to brim with the promise of rapid socioeconomic development and an enhancement of quality . of life . Today , a half century later , development , measured in terms of achievements such as the progressive elimination of poverty , unemployment and inequality , seems an elusive goal for many parts of both the Third World and the Arab World . While in terms of sheer population numbers more people are living longer , the social and economic condition of their lives is often bleak . This is true particularly for some sectors of Arab society that have been ravaged by recent warfare , famine , poverty , military occupation , and/or the corrosive influences of internal divisions or external threats . <p> Education has been linked with Arab aspirations for national development at least since the reforms of Muhammad Ali in 19th century Egypt , although it is an even older remnant of the culture-wide appreciation for learning . Education furthers the national capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the most basic level , it is a country 's primary educational system that provides the bedrock for social and economic development . This is so because schooling is of critical importance to a nation 's human resource capacity . It provides young people with the cognitive skills ( basic literacy , numeracy , communication and problem-solving skills ) upon which they can later build . Thus it is the base for " all further schooling , training , or self-education " ( A. Chantavanich et al , 1990:1 ) . In countries where resources are meager and pupil retention rates are low , primary education is not only a base , it is also the ceiling of formal education . <p> While we can not expect miracles from primal , education , we can expect beneficial outcomes ( Eisemon , 1987 ) . A large body of evidence demonstrates that completed primary . education improves agricultural productivity and , more generally , productivity at work and in the home , facilitates literacy and communication , increases individual earnings , improves health and nutritional status , raises life expectancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , for example , Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990 ; Habte et el. , 1983 ; Psacharopoulos , 1984 ; Eisemon , 1989 ) . These results , among others , are all indicators of social and economic development . To the extent that primary education can potentiate so much later growth and development , how do we assess Arab society 's preparedness and effectiveness in this area ? Often educational development is measured by the proportions of people of a given age group who are in the educational system or who have successfully completed an educational cycle . Greater proportions are seen as reflective of equality of access and equality of access is seen as an indicator of optimal utilization of human resources . <p> Yet it may well be asked : Access to what ? Access for what ? Increasingly , research attention is shifting from enumerating pupils or graduates to queries concerning educational quality . What was once regarded as a politically sensitive topic has now come center stage : <p> . . . the experiences gained in two decades of reform and intervention experiments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although cultural differences remain , the quality of education can -- and indeed should -- be subjected to technical scrutiny . ( Heyneman , 1986:3 ) <p> It is not just the existence of formal education but its nature which is at issue . Lockheed and Verspoor ( 1990:vii ) note that " the quality of primary . education in a country must be judged according to the total learning of all its children . To improve the quality of primary education , therefore , is to ensure that more of a nation 's children complete the primary cycle , having learned what is taught . " <p> In a relevant review of the literature on the quality of education and economic growth , Solmen ( 1986:14 ) observes : <p> Improvements in the quality of schooling provided in developing countries may be more important for the future economic prospects of these nations in the long run than will expanded access to poor quality education . Thus the quandary of equity versus efficiency will have to be addressed in these countries as it has been in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of schooling has more effect on the cognitive and behavior outcomes for students in developing areas than in developed areas . Fuller et al . ' s ( 1986 ) research in Mexico supports this with a study comparing levels of investment in school quality and the rates of growth a decade later . The reports from regional and international educational authorities suggest that the need to address the quality issue is nowhere more pressing than in developing countries ; even in those Arab countries where educational access is severely constrained , questions regarding the quantity . of education do not replace questions regarding educational quality ( see , for example , Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990 ; Solmort , 1986 ; Habte and Heyneman , 1983 ; Psacharopoulos , 1984 ; Eisemon , 1989 ) . <p> This paper examines issues relating to the quality of primary education in the Arab World . The study assesses the relation between excellence in education and national aspirations for socioeconomic development . The reality of development planning in the Arab world is that the constituent countries are not equivalent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailing institutional arrangements . Hence , while our arguments are necessarily general to allow broad applicability , the practical utility of this analysis is contingent on sensitivity to each Arab country 's unique social , economic , historical and cultural conditions . <p> This discussion is divided into three sections . Following a brief note on research procedure , the first section provides a critical review of trends affecting the educational climate for Arab children . Secondly , we examine the quality of Arab primary education in terms of equity of access . This will be followed by a discussion of selected indicators of educational quality . Throughout the discussion , we suggest strategies and policy options which may help to improve the state of primary education in the Arab World . DATA <p> The statistical data provided in the accompanying tables are extracted from compilations by Lockheed and Verspoor ( 1990:165ff ) . These compilations are based on the UNESCO database for education and the World Bank database for economic indicators . All the member states of the Arab League are included , with the exception of Palestine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Djibouti and Qatar ) . In these tables , the Arab states are grouped into four major economic groups based on 1986 GNP per capita data : ( 1 ) " low-income " economies ( where per capita incomes are less than $450 ) ; ( 2 ) " lower-middle-income " economies ( where per capita incomes range between $450 and $1700 ) ; ( 3 ) " upper-middle-income " economies ( where per capita incomes range between $1700 and $7425 ) ; ( 4 ) " high-income " economies ( where per capita incomes exceed $7425 ) . These four economic groups are based on the World Development Report ( World Bank , 1988 ) . <p> Empirical evidence on the quality of education in the various countries of the Arab World is rather sketchy . No government has a system of assessment in place to evaluate children 's learning success or to monitor their educational progress . Programs are implemented but rarely evaluated . Good intentions can not replace informed assessment . Until rigorous Arab evaluation programs are in place , evidence from other developing nations facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDUCATIONAL CLIMATE <p> Generally , primary educational systems in the Arab World have been characterized by both success and failure . The most outstanding success is a quantitative one , illustrating the spread of primary education to include increasing numbers of children . Since the end of World War II , educational development has been a priority in virtually every Arab country . In terms of absolute numbers , the expansion of Arab education has been particularly dramatic at the primary level , with average enrollment growth rates exceeding population growth rates by a large margin . For several Arab countries , substantial gains were made between 1950 and 1965 . But , for practically all of these countries the rate of educational growth has been even more spectacular over the last two decades . For example , between 1965 and 1985 , enrollments at the primary level in the eighteen most populous Arab states increased by 250% , or from about 10 million to over 25 million ( see Table 1 ) . This increase is equivalent to providing schooling for an additional 2,100 pupils every day for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noteworthy trends in primary education in the Arab World include the provision of more teachers , schools , buildings , curricula and resource materials . In addition , school expansion has narrowed the gender gap in access to primary education , increased the proportion of 6-11 year-olds enrolled at primary levels , and improved the " internal efficiency " ( i.e. , raised the ratio of primary . school graduates to primary school entrants ) . <p> For most of the post-Second World War period , educational budgets rose steadily , although the rate of educational growth declined somewhat during the 1980s due to deteriorating social , economic and political conditions ( Al-Bassam , 1989:70 ) . In terms of financial resources , the recurrent expenditures on primary education in many Arab countries claim around 50% of the total educational budget . The high cost of primary education coupled with the downturn in the economies of many Arab countries may limit governments ' capacity to further develop the primary educational system . <p> While successes in educational expansion are noteworthy , it is important to recognize setbacks and obstacles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in sociocultural context . Social and political events at the national and regional level can undermine the experiences of school children . At this macrolevel , in certain parts of the Arab World , including areas which were once educationally advantaged , primary education has regreressed sometimes to the point of devastation , due to internal strife , warfare or military occupation by foreign troops . For example , the ongoing internal struggle both in Sorealia and the Sudan has deprived many children of proper education . Similarly , in Lebanon the civil war which started in 1975 has had adverse effects on the educational system at all levels . During most of the civil war , primary schools experienced extended closures and lost their efficacy and moral suasion in influencing children and maintaining standards . Also , in Iraq , in the aftermath of the Gulf Wax , the mental and physical health of school children is at risk as they face devastated resources and institutions ( see Abu-Laban and Aliadin , 1991 ) . In fact the disastrous effects of the Gulf War on school children extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , close to a million Yemini workers were expelled from Saudi Arabia , severing the economic security , of large numbers of dependent Yemeni school children . Even in oil-rich Libya , school children are potentially vulnerable to geopolitical power plays as a result of the U.N . sanctions approved in mid-April 1992 . <p> A similar illustration of educational catastrophe is found in the experience of the Palestinian people in the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 . In all primary schools in the West Bank and Gaza , whether public , UNRWA or private , the system has deteriorated since the Israeli occupation . Within two months of the occupation , in August 1967 , 78 of 121 textbooks used by Palestinian children were banned and education came under the sole control of the Israeli occupation authorities ( Fasheh , 1989:516 ) . Hence , neither in the hiring nor firing of teachers , nor in the continuing technical evaluation of curriculum objectives , development of curricula or new programs , nor in school construction did the Palestinians themselves have decision-making power . The Israeli occupation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years of the intifada , for example , of 210 school days per year , primary schools in the West Bank were ordered to close 63 days in 1987-88 ; 175 days in 1988-89 ; 70 days in 1989-90 ; and 51 days in 1990-91 ( B'Tselem , 1991 ) . Such arbitrary closures wreck havoc on the education of all students but , given that they are still acquiring the basic skills necessary for independent self-education , primary students are put at particular risk . <p> What we have is a situation where entire cohorts of Arab children have their lives and their primary education disrupted by macrolevel forces rarely anticipated in formulating educational policies for developing countries . The repeated tragedies in their lives suggest that there are large numbers of Arab students with special needs which must be identified and assessed . <p> In addition , as will be illustrated in the following sections , Arab primary education is plagued by other problems including , among other things : falling short of the goal of universal primary education ; inequities in access to schools ; undertrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdated curricula ; poor quality and insufficient teaching materials ; and high dropout and repetition rates . Given that the majority of students in the Arab World do not go beyond the primary level , it is of critical importance that their education be of high quality and that they are cognitively equipped to solve new and more complex problems in their day-to-day lives . <p> While scant , the available evidence on the performance of Arab pupils in international achievement tests , national examinations , and end-of-year school examinations at different primary school levels underlines serious deficiencies in the internal efficiency of Arab primary education systems ( Massialas and Jarrar , 1987 ; 1983 ) . In other words , the process of developing children 's cognitive skills , the stated goal of primary education , is tarnished not only by deficits in the academic development of children , but also by wastage . Naturally , there are variations in efficiency across Arab countries and even within the same country , but no Arab country is exempt from the need to improve its system of primary education . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization ( ALECSO ) published a critical , future-oriented document titled/he Strategy for the Development of Arab Education which was as ambitious as it was pathbreaking . It dealt with the broad range of quantitative and qualitative problems confronting Arab education . The strategy was to be implemented in four stages within a fifteen-year span . A sequel to this publication assessed progress made in the implementation of the 1979 strategy ( Al-Bassam , 1989 ) . The results of this assessment show that Arab education is still in need of attention and qualitative improvements . The following sections will identify some of the main failings of Arab primary education and suggest remedial strategies ( see also Verspoor , 1989 ; and Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990 ) . EQUITY OF ACCESS <p> Access to education , a topic of much current research , is not limited to efforts to increase opportunities for enrollment . It includes , in addition , efforts to improve educational opportunities for all groups in society regardless of gender , geographical location or socioeconomic status , as well as efforts to increase student retention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantitative and qualitative components in the educational system and , hence , it is multidimensional in nature and can be measured in different ways . <p> An obvious and simple way of measuring overall access takes the form of comparing the total number of students attending primary school at differing points in time . This approach may be extended to cover changes over time in the magnitude of educational resources such as teachers , schools , and educational materials . The evidence on any of these indicators may be presented at different levels : on a country-by-country basis , or for regions within a country , or for the entire Arab World . <p> It should be emphasized that enrollments are not entirely a function of supply of educational resources ( i.e. schools and teachers ) ; they are also a function of demand , i.e. , interest on the part of different groups in accessing educational opportunities . On the demand side of the equation , the literature shows that there are " different patterns of access and retention among wealthy/poor , male/female , and urban/rural children " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these patterns is determined by comparing the number of students from each relevant category with the total enrollment ( e.g. , females as a percentage of all students enrolled ) . <p> As indicated earlier , the total number of students enrolled in primary schools in Arab countries increased phenomenally between 1965 and 1985 ( Table 1 ) . While absolute numbers provide a striking picture of educational growth , they are inadequate indicators of progress toward the goal of universal education . To assess this , we need to compare the number of students enrolled with the school age population ( i.e. , the 6-11 year olds ) . <p> Table 2 shows that between 1965 and 1985 , the percentages of 6-11 year olds in school rose considerably for practically all Arab countries . In 1985 , these percentages were highest in Libya , Syria , Tunisia , Iraq , Egypt , and Algeria , ranging from about 86% to 107% ; and lowest in Sudan ( 45.6% ) , Mauritania ( 33.2% ) , and Somalia ( 9.6% ) . The remainder of the Arab states were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their wide range , that for many Arab countries , considerable work needs to be done before the goal of universal education is achieved . <p> In all of the Arab countries for which information is available , the proportion of female students at the primary level has been increasing , but there are still some sharp gender inequities in access to education ( Table 1 ) . In 1985 , for example , the female percentage of the total enrollment ranged widely : 49% for Kuwait , 48% for Jordan and the U.A.E. , 47% for Lebanon and Libya , 46% for Syria , 45% for Iraq and Tunisia , 44% for Algeria and Oman , 43% for Egypt and Saudi Arabia , 40% for Sudan and Mauritania , 38% for Morocco , 34% for Somalia , 26% for the People 's Democratic Republic of Yemen , and 20% for the Arab Republic of Yemen . Those Arab governments with gender gaps in access could play critical , innovative roles in improving educational accessibility for females by establishing outreach programs directed toward eliciting community and family support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequity in educational accessibility in the Arab World relate to socioeconomic status and place of residence . In many impoverished families , children are removed from school at an early age . In addition , numerous studies indicate that rural residents are markedly disadvantaged relative to urban residents ( see , for example , Al-Bassam , 1989 ; and Cameron and Hurst , 1983:543 ) . As with the gender gap , the class and rural-urban gaps in access to primary education could be narrowed by determined action . Efficiency of the Education System <p> A useful indicator of the efficiency of the education system is the graduation or completion rate , which is defined as the ratio of the number of students who complete their primary education to the number of primary school entrants . At the aggregate level , in North Africa and the Middle East , the completion rates have steadily over the years . In the 1940s , for example , 6 out of 10 entrants completed the primary cycle , compared to about 8 out of 10 at the present time . The observe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hurst , 1983 ; and Horn and Arriagada , 1986 ) . <p> Useful as it is. the completion rate does not take account of another aspect of efficiency and that is , the frequency of grade repetition in the system . Table 3 shows that there are substantial differences among the Arab countries in grade repetition rates , which in 1985 ranged from 1.5% for Egypt to 22.9% for the Arab Republic of Yemen . Between these two extremes are : Jordan ( 4.7% ) , Kuwait ( 5.2% ) , U.A.E. ( 5.7% ) , Syria ( 7.5% ) , Algeria ( 7.5% ) , Oman ( 11.7% ) , Saudi Arabia ( 12.4% ) , Mauritania ( 18.3% ) , Morocco ( 19.8% ) , Tunisia ( 20.4% ) , and Iraq ( 20.8% ) . It is clear that the repetition rates in several Arab states are extremely high and special efforts could be made to cut down on this wasteful duplication . Strategies and Policy Implications <p> The preceding analysis indicates that Arab governments , in varying degrees , need to improve access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of educational opportunities , planners should be clear on whether education is viewed as a goal in itself , that is , a basic human right , or as a means to achieving other goals such as socioeconomic development and/or national integration . This is important because each view entails a somewhat different set of policy options and priorities . For example , if education is viewed as a basic human right , then the stress would tend to be on universality and disadvantaged groups ( such as the poor , distant communities , females , and ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ) would have to be singled out for special attention . On the other hand , if education is viewed as a vehicle for national development , the government would tend to define and target economically relevant groups , such as farmers , while emphasizing educational relevance and quality . <p> While budgetary constraints may discourage some governments from even attempting a start , this would be a missed opportunity because there are cost-effective measures that could be employed to improve both the quantity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature suggests that progress on these goals can be made without even increasing costs . The following suggestions for improving educational access are , therefore , mindful of current economic concerns . It is suggested that planners : Restructure training programs for primary school teachers . Eliminate unnecessary replication with secondary education and provide shorter , more focused programs which emphasize pedagogical training . Institute double shifts , where appropriate , as has been done rather effectively in Egypt and Yemen Arab Republic . Use existing institutions such as mosques for expanding the supply , as has been done effectively in small , distant rural settlements in Pakistan 's Sind province . Such arrangements are believed to be most effective if they take the " form of pre-schooling or after-school classes . " ( Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990:107 ) Develop distance education methods , such as interactive radio programming , and other new learning technologies that are cost-effective and consistent with the cultural traditions . Mobilize community support and involve parents and local resources as much as possible in the educational process . Target specific groups ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to support and facilitate their children 's education . Reduce wastage first , by increasing the completion rate and second , by reducing the grade repetition and dropout rates . Another noteworthy aspect of wastage concerns the production of underlearners , but unfortunately we lack systematic information on this . <p> The utility of the above noted policy options is contingent on a given country 's social , economic and cultural traditions . This means that education planners will place differential emphasis on these options to suit their local and national needs . No less important is the fact that access to education implies not only quantitative but also qualitative improvements in the education system . In fact , both of these aspects of accessibility are interrelated . The literature clearly shows that where there is emphasis on quality , a certain degree of quantitative improvement tends to follow automatically in the form of greater demand , community support . higher completion rates , and lower dropout and repetition rates . The next section of the paper examines the available evidence on educational quality and how it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructional methods and strategies , and more efficient management systems . SELECTED INDICATORS OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY <p> Educators and political leaders have long known that basic education in the Arab countries needs to be overhauled . A legacy of the colonial past , the system is in a torpid condition and both the curriculum and associated educational materials require restructuring and upgrading ( Lockheed and Vetspoor , 1990 ; Al-Bassam , 1989 ; Massialas and Jarrar , 1987 ; 1983 ; and Cameron and Hurst , 1983 ) . All efforts to improve teaching and learning have met with partial success , at best . Curriculum <p> Naturally , the curriculum plays a central role in structuring the learning experiences of students . According to Bacchus ( 1990 ) , curriculum refers to the content of both formal and informal instructional and learning experiences , instructional strategies , materials and facilities and methods of evaluating the success of curriculum goals . Implied in this definition is an important distinction between the " intended " and the " implemented " curriculum . Actual curriculum implementation brings into focus teachers and textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at the center of any efforts to improve the quality of basic education and implies . . . a coordinated effort in all the areas included . ... " ( Bacchus , 1990 ) . <p> It may be useful at this point to make a few observations about curricular content in primary schools throughout the world . The evidence suggests that , worldwide , there are remarkable similarities in the subjects taught and the relative emphasis given to these subjects , regardless of the country 's level of economic development . For example , a recent study of 130 countries representing high , medium and low-income economies , shows that at each economic level about 35% of the available time is devoted to language ; 18% to mathematics ; 8-10% each to science , social studies , music and art , and physical education ; and 5% to moral studies . The main difference is found in vocational subjects ( agriculture , domestic science and business ) , in lower-income economies , where 6-7% of the available time is devoted to these subjects , compared to only 1-2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Lockheed and Vetspoor , 1990:31 ) . <p> The curricular content in primary schools in the Arab World , . in general , is quite consistent with world patterns , but there are variations in emphasis across Arab countries . To a large degree , these variations center around greater or lesser emphasis on religious-humanistic subjects , foreign languages , and vocational and practical training . There are also differences attributable to the movements involving " Arabization " and " nationalization " , of the curriculum in Libya , Tunisia , Algeria and Morocco which began in the 1950s and 1960s . While some inter-Arab differences in curricular content are to be expected , there are educators ( e.g. , Massialas and Jarrar , 1987 ) who argue that the quality of primary education could be improved considerably by giving more attention to science and vocational and practical training and less attention to religious-humanistic subjects . This argument may be valid , but it should not be made in the abstract or in principle . To evaluate the curriculum , educators need to relate its content to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . The curriculum may be structured differently , depending on whether education is viewed as an end in itself or as a means to other goals . <p> A much more promising course of action than simply adjusting the curriculum is to critically examine its development and implementation and how these two processes may be improved . For example , in all Arab countries , without exception , the curriculum is centrally developed by education ministry officials , with help from experts . Hence , it is imposed from above , with neither the community nor teachers having much say in the process . In this connection , it is important to note that studies carried out in other developing countries emphasize the significant contributions that parents and community leaders can make to curriculum development and reform . This is even more true where educational goals are directed toward equipping students to live and work successfully within their own communities ( Bacchus , 1990 ) . Still , another potential benefit resulting from stronger community-school links is that these may enhance children 's academic performance . Hence , curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In terms of implementation , teachers are , of course , critical . Teachers <p> The curriculum 's stated goals are entrusted to teachers to achieve . It is important , therefore , to ensure teachers ' clear understanding of and commitment to these goals . How is this done ? Modern social psychology tells us that participation in decision-making enhances commitment to the decisions made . In line with this , it would be beneficial to involve the teachers in the process of curriculum development and change . As well as improving the quality and relevance of the curriculum , teachers ' involvement would also increase the likelihood that it is successfully implemented . <p> Obviously , the teacher is the most central person in curriculum implementation and in providing opportunities for learning . The quality of education is determined largely by the teacher 's knowledge of the subject matter as well as teaching skills . Current reports on teachers and teaching practices in the Arab countries are not altogether complimentary . While some countries are better off than others , it is nevertheless the case that many Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they often employ teaching methods which alienate students and discourage their participation , independent initiative , and critical thinking . Teachers tend to be strict disciplinarian and authoritarian rather than educators with a wide range of instructional strategies ( cf. Massialas and Jarrar , 1987 ) . All too often , teachers expect their students to copy from the blackboard , memorize , refrain from asking questions and avoid making mistakes . In addition to being teacher-centered , the system is also dominated by examinations . It is a system for young children which is more fear- and conformity-inducing than discovery oriented . <p> Research evidence suggests that the opportunities for learning in Arab primary schools could be improved by exposing teachers to modern teaching methods and re-orienting them to become child-centered and encouraging of self-learning ( Bude , 1990 ) . The teaching practices most conducive to learning are those that involve the student as an active participant , giving him or her the opportunity to practice and apply what is taught in his or her own life ( see Lockheed and Verspoor , 1990:42 ) . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve . In addition , the dropout , grade repetition and absenteeism rates would likely decline . Textbooks and Learning Materials <p> Recent studies and demonstration projects carried out in developing countries show that learning improves considerably with the use of textbooks , so much so that the World Bank Report on Education in Africa views textbooks as the single most important and cost-effective instrument for improving the quality of education ( Bacchus , 1990 ) . Like a good teacher , a good textbook is rare but it is necessary to have . Neumann ( 1980:11 ) delineates the qualities of a good text : <p> Just as a lesson taught by a teacher is more than chalk and talk , a textbook page , a unit , or chapter , should be more than a recital of fact or a setting out of exercises . It must be visual : offer structure , variety , and present its materials in different ways ; it should motivate , spiral , and reinforce . A textbook must be organized and divided into units that fit the classroom situation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for individualization , for the different abilities represented in the classroom . <p> Judged in terms of the above noted qualities , textbooks in the Arab countries are found to be wanting . Cameron and Hurst ( 1983:544 ) state that " textbooks and other teaching aids in the Arab countries are often in short supply , of poor quality and irrelevant content . " In a similar vein , Massialas and Jarrar ( 1983:77 ) critically note that Arabic textbooks tend to present unrealistic pictures of society and are not up to date on scientific information . In terms of physical appearance , Arabic textbooks , in general , are neither attractive to the learner nor well illustrated . Because of these and other deficiencies , it has been noted that " many ' Arab countries experienced and continue to experience a state of affairs where texts are available but not often read " ( Massialas and Jarrar , 1983:331 and 94-98 ) . There is here a clear need to improve the quality of Arabic textbooks and make them relevant to the experiences of a broad spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instructional materials have impact on the quality . of education . Learning aids , which range from exercise books and notebooks to maps , science equipment , libraries and visual aids , are in limited supply and , when available , they are unevenly distributed . Schools in smaller communities and in rural areas are most disadvantaged . In addition , teacher guides , which are normally integrated with textbooks , help the teacher to use textbooks most effectively , monitor student achievement , and adjust classroom activities to suit the learners ' needs . In Arab countries , as in other developing countries , teacher guides are seldom available . The paucity of these materials further compromises the quality of primary education . Administration and Control of Education <p> To improve teaching and learning we must also look at the administration and control of education . This is an important area because it has a bearing on teachers ' morale , creativity and effectiveness and , ultimately , on student achievement . It is clear from the preceding discussion that in almost all Arab states , all major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas such as teacher selection , training and placement , and examinations are highly centralized in ministries of education . In fact , the system also reflects a high degree of centralization at the district ( or regional ) as well as the school level . With reference to the latter level , authority resides solely in the hands of the school principal . While the principal 's authority is not absolute , circumscribed as it is by higher levels of administration , he or she tends to be a strict , authoritarian administrator , allowing little decision-making power for the teacher to innovate and be creative . School principals are usually recruited from the ranks of teachers and , therefore , they lack the necessary administrative skills as well as specialized training . Given this state of affairs , there is a glaring need to modernize educational administration in the Arab World and to create a better balance between centralization and decentralization of administrative function . Strategies and Policy Implications <p> In the past 20-30 years , there have been many attempts to improve the quality of primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some countries have been more successful than others . However , the need to intensify efforts to improve teaching and learning in all Arab countries has never been more pressing . The evidence suggests that these efforts should concentrate on several areas including curriculum development and reform , upgrading of teacher qualifications and use of modern teaching methods . and modernization of educational administration . Judging from up-to-date studies conducted in developing countries , including some Arab countries . a list of policy options is provided below . While not exhaustive , the policy options proposed below have been identified with a view to cost-effectiveness and potential promise to achieve the desired goal : Involve parents , community leaders and teachers in the process of curriculum development and reform . Invest more heavily in curriculum implementation and , in particular , the production of high quality , relevant , textbooks with integrated teacher guides . Provide a wider range of learning aids and make them available more equitably throughout the system . Institute well designed in-service teacher training programs to upgrade teachers ' qualifications and expose them to modern teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view to placing more emphasis on the development of more appropriate teaching strategies and techniques ( i.e. skills of the trade ) as well as on student teaching practice . Encourage the utilization of non-directive methods of learning in order facilitate student participation in the learning process . Encourage and reward innovative practices among teachers and support the institution of experimental programs within schools in order to improve student achievement . Provide specially designed training programs for school administrators and others within the system , in order to enhance their administrative skills and modernize the administrative system . <p> As in the case of the suggestions made earlier , the above policy options and strategies may be applied selectively , with varying degrees of emphasis , sensitive to local and national varieties . However , sooner or later , all of these options , along with others , will have to be addressed if the goal of improving the quality of primary education is to be achieved . CONCLUSION <p> Social and economic development is a multifaceted process , an important component of which concerns the educational system ( cf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primary education is based " on two considerations . First , . the evidence suggests that the social and economic impact of primary education is greater when educational quality is high . Second , with particular reference to the Arab World , a large proportion of children do not go beyond the primary level . Hence the quality of primary education should be a critical consideration in every country 's development plan . <p> Improving the quality of primary education is a highly complex task . This discussion has provided a broad assessment of educational quality in the Arab World and suggested strategies for the improvement of teaching and learning . The emphasis on student achievement is well placed because both the individual learner and society at large will benefit from such an improvement . In view of the fact that there are many factors which impinge on student achievement , it is necessary to devise an orderly , integrated approach . All things can not be accomplished at a single point in time particularly during periods of economic scarcity . On the other hand , a piecemeal approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A future-planning approach which offers a carefully sequenced and integrated agenda of change has the best chance for improving the quality of primary education in the Arab World . Quality education at this basic level is of central importance to the further growth and development of the region and its peoples .

@@4019941 The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ( NCLB ) is without peer in the annals of federal education legislation . Prior to the passage of NCLB , no law had ever inserted the U.S. Department of Education directly into the sacrosanct areas of state and local responsibility for ensuring student achievement , using research-validated practices , and dictating the qualifications of our nation 's teachers . Teacher quality and the " highly qualified " standard is at the forefront of the NCLB promise ( some would say " threat " ) that all students will learn more than they are currently learning ; if not , schools and teachers will be held accountable for their failure . As a means to increase student achievement and hold teachers more accountable , NCLB applies pressure to every sector of the education community . Nowhere has that pressure been felt more than in special education programs for students with high incidence disabilities in rural areas where one-third of the nation 's school districts are located . <p> The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current status of the federal requirements for highly qualified special education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As adopted in NCLB and the newly reauthorized Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act ( IDEA 04 ) , we analyze the impact of the highly qualified standard on recruitment and preparation of special education teachers in rural areas and address alternative approaches for meeting federal requirements . The Federal View of a Highly Qualified Special Education Teacher <p> Signed into law in 2001 , NCLB was very explicit about what constitutes a " highly qualified " elementary or secondary teacher . An individual is considered highly qualified if he or she has obtained full state certification/licensure , or successfully passed a state 's teacher licensing examination . A highly qualified teacher is certified or licensed to teach in a given state and must not have had state requirements waived on an emergency , temporary , or provisional basis . New elementary teachers must hold a bachelor 's degree and demonstrate subject knowledge and teaching skills in basic elementary school curriculum , including but not limited to , reading , writing and mathematics . Subject matter competency and teaching skills must be measured by " a rigorous state test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bachelors degree and demonstrate a high level of competency in the academic subjects they teach . Subject matter competence must be measured by " a rigorous state subject matter test , " or by completing an undergraduate major in the subject area , a graduate degree , or by completing coursework equivalent to an undergraduate academic major . <p> Effective 2002-2003 , the law required that all new Title I teachers must have met the above requirements . Additionally , a state 's Title I plan must include measurable objectives to ensure that all teachers providing instruction in " core subjects " ( such as English , math , science , social studies , foreign languages , or art ) meet the highly qualified definition by the end of the 2005-2006 school year . Qualifications for veteran teachers were also specified in statute . Veteran teachers must hold at least a bachelors ' degree and be held to the same standard as new elementary , middle , and secondary teachers . They may , however , demonstrate their competence in the teaching of academic subjects based on " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ( For more information on HOUSSE criteria , See U.S. Department of Education 2004 , The Secretary 's Third Annual Report on Teacher Quality . ) <p> Although explicit regarding the expectations for elementary and secondary teachers , NCLB requirements to be a " highly qualified " special education teacher were nowhere to be found . In fact , it was n't until December of 2002 that the Department of Education promulgated federal regulations that were intended to clarify that the standard really does apply to all teachers , including special educators ( 34 CFR Part 200 , December 2 , 2002 ) . As per the federal rule , any special education teacher who directly instructs students on core academic subjects must meet the highly qualified standard . However , the rule further stipulated that any special educator who is not directly instructing students with disabilities in core academic subjects , or who is only providing consultation to teachers who are highly qualified , did not have to meet the same subject-matter competency requirements under NCLB . In other words , some special education teachers would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of whether they held full state certification/licensure or had successfully passed a state 's teacher licensing examination . Schools received additional policy guidance from the Department of Education on special education teachers and the highly qualified standard in September 2003 . This policy stated that any special education teacher who is providing instruction in core academic subjects must be highly qualified in each subject , regardless of the instructional setting . <p> In November 2004 , Congress passed H.R. 1350 , the Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act ( herein referred to as IDEA 04 ) . A major purpose in amending IDEA 97 was to align current law with the accountability provisions in NCLB , including what it means to be a highly qualified special education teacher . IDEA 04 states that the term " highly qualified " has the same meaning as applied to elementary , middle , and secondary teachers in NCLB ( H.R. 1350 Section 602 10AJ ) . This means that new and veteran special education teachers at the elementary level must have subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading , writing , mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New and veteran special education teachers at the middle and secondary level must have subject knowledge and teaching skills in academic subjects in which the teacher has responsibility for instruction ( teacher of record ) . <p> Specifically , IDEA 04 requires that special education teachers must hold a bachelors degree and " . obtain full State certification as a special education teacher ( including certification obtained through alternative routes to certification ) or passed the State special education teacher licensing examination . " ( H.R. 1350 Section 602 10Bi ) . As is true with elementary and secondary teachers , highly qualified special education teachers must not have had their certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency , temporary , or provisional basis . <p> In addition to the above requirements , special education teachers who are teaching core academic subjects " exclusively to children who are assessed against alternate achievement standards " must meet the same requirements as highly qualified elementary teachers unless the instruction is " above the elementary level . " In that case , the special education teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran special education teachers who teach two or more subjects at the middle or secondary level must also meet the applicable requirements in NCLB . New special education teachers who teach multiple subjects must be highly qualified in one subject area ( mathematics , arts , or science ) and will have two years from the date of employment to demonstrate competence in the additional core academic subjects they teach by passing a state 's HOUSSE or meeting NCLB content requirements . Veteran special education teachers at the middle or secondary level who teach multiple subjects must also demonstrate competence in all core academic subjects they teach by passing a state 's HOUSSE or meeting NCLB content requirements . However , these teachers are not provided a two-year grace period to demonstrate competence in the core academic subjects they teach . <p> Finally , there is no statutory language in IDEA 04 regarding special education teachers who only provide consultative services to a highly qualified teacher . However , report language for H.R. 1350 clarifies it is the intent of Congress that special education teachers in consultative roles be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Section 602 . Applying the Highly Qualified Standard to Rural Special Education Teachers in High Incidence Areas <p> Several factors must be considered in examining the impact of the highly qualified standard for rural special education teachers working in high incidence areas . First and foremost is the need to ensure that all students with a disability in rural schools have access to special education teachers who are able to meet their unique instructional needs as required by IDEA . On this point , there is considerable disagreement among educators as to whether NCLB 's highly qualified standard is synonymous with the concept of " high quality . " As stated by Brownell , Sindelar , Bishop , Langley , and Seo ( 2002 ) , the NCLB emphasis for general educators is on a thorough knowledge of the content being taught and the verbal ability to deliver that content . It is not on pedagogy . The need to shift from pedagogy to content knowledge and verbal ability is a central theme in the first annual Secretary of Education 's Report on Teacher Quality ( U.S. Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedagogically-oriented courses and student teaching experiences within colleges of education are not requisites for becoming an effective teacher . This position is reinforced in the Title II requirements of the Higher Education Act ( HEA ) . Title II requires that states must have in place requirements for content-specific bachelor 's degrees and assessments that measure prospective teacher 's academic content knowledge . In the third annual report on teacher quality , the Secretary of Education reiterates that " overall , state progress in raising standards for prospective teachers is mixed , and significant barriers still exist for teachers pursuing traditional routes to certification and licensure . " ( U.S. Department of Education , 2004 ) . <p> The disproportionate emphasis on content knowledge as espoused within NCLB and by the Secretary of Education runs contrary to the views of many special education professionals . Special education as a field is based on pedagogical expertise , including " continuously assessing student performance , adapting curricula to individual needs , modifying instructional approaches , using positive behavioral interventions , and selecting and implementing appropriate accommodations to facilitate access to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children ( TED ) , 2004 , p. 1 ) . In espousing this view , HECSE and TED argued that any application of the highly qualified standard to special educators should take into account the importance of pedagogical expertise in meeting the instructional needs of students with disabilities . They strongly suggested that any new provisions in IDEA that allowed special education teachers to become fully licensed or certified by simply passing a content knowledge test " would not be sufficient to meet the diverse needs of students with disabilities . " Special educators must demonstrate their specialized knowledge and skills in actual field settings . ( HECSE/ TED , 2004 ) . Obviously , Congress rejected the HECSE/TED recommendation and provided an option in IDEA 04 whereby an individual with a bachelor 's degree and no field experience can become a highly qualified special education teacher by simply passing a state licensing exam . <p> A second factor to consider in examining the impact of the highly qualified standard on rural schools is the critical shortage of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menlove and Lignugaris/Kraft ( 2004 ) report that while special education teacher shortages are critical nationwide , they are " most critical in rural areas of the country " ( p. 18 ) . Thurston and Sebastian ( 1996 ) suggest that an entire small school district can be jeopardized by the lack of a qualified special education teacher and that filling these positions in rural areas is often more problematic than in urban areas . Rural districts often have yearly attrition rates in excess of 30% and may experience a 100% turnover within three years ( Williams , Martin , &; Hess , 2002 ) . <p> Given the existing crisis in the number of qualified rural special education personnel , a logical question is whether the implementation of the IDEA 04 " highly qualified " standard will help or further exacerbate the problem ? The issue is complex and dependent upon several interacting variables , including service delivery options in small school districts ( particularly at the secondary level ) and alternative teacher preparation programs that maintain quality while facilitating access to a career in special education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural areas , subject matter competence for special educators will be particularly burdensome in secondary schools where a teacher may be responsible for most , if not all , core academic subjects for students in high incidence disability areas . Given that rural areas are already facing the most critical special education teacher shortages nationwide ( Menlove &; Lignugaris/Kraft , 2004 ) , the additional subject matter requirements could easily become a further disincentive to a career in the field . A potential way around this disincentive is to modify service delivery . As addressed earlier , the IDEA 04 requirement for subject matter competency applies only to special education teachers who have the responsibility for instruction ( teacher of record ) and not to " consultative teachers . " As such , rural districts may choose to use special educators more in a consultative role in which they work directly with or support highly qualified general education teachers who have subject matter competence . This option alleviates the need for highly qualified special educators to become proficient in multiple subject areas and is consistent with the view that pedagogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , etc ) is the hallmark of an effective special education teacher . However , if rural schools choose to modify service delivery and use special educators in consultative roles , they must also ensure that every student 's instructional program meets the requirement for a free and appropriate education ( FAPE ) in the least restrictive environment . Meeting the Highly Qualified Challenge : Alternative Routes ( AR ) to Teacher Preparation <p> In aligning IDEA with NCLB , Congress continued its emphasis on alternatives to traditional teacher preparation as a strategy to reduce teacher shortages . As suggested by the U.S Department of Education ( 2003 ) , states may " streamline their certification processes and . target talented people who would be turned off by traditional preparation . " The logic underlying this strategy seems to apply best to shortages of math and science teachers . It holds that content mastery and verbal ability are more important to effective teaching than is training in pedagogy . By eliminating formal requirements , it is argued , we may recruit into teaching scientists , engineers , accountants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by teacher preparation . Although the issue of whether this logic is borne out by research need not be addressed here , suffice to say that it has been hotly contested ( see Darling-Hammond &; Ducommun , 2001 ; Progressive Policy Institute , 2001 ; The Abell Foundation , 2001 ) and that math and science educators have questioned its validity , even within those disciplines . They cite the importance of pedagogical content knowledge and the problems some untrained novice teachers experience in representing what they know in ways that are meaningful to children and adolescents ( cf. , Nathan &; Petrosino , 2003 ) . <p> In special education , the logic fits poorly . For one thing , our field is not a content area in the same sense as math and science . There is no source of prospective special education teachers who , like scientists and mathematicians , have special education content expertise , and , it is unclear what population of prospective teachers this strategy would tap . Second , as argued before , in teaching students with disabilities , pedagogical expertise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is an essential element of a special education teachers ' repertoire of skills , knowledge , and dispositions . Nonetheless , NCLB policy promoting fast-track teacher preparation has been extended to special education ( and elementary education ) , and special education alternative preparation is a growth industry . <p> Although alternative route ( AR ) programs differ from one state to the next ( and even within states ) , the defining characteristic of AR programs is access to a teaching credential that bypasses conventional college and university preparation requirements ( Hawley , 1992 ; Zeichner &; Schulte , 2001 ) . AR programs are best viewed as existing on a continuum ranging from abbreviated , fast-track training ( of the NCLB ilk ) to more conventional training that builds on participants ' life experiences ( Hillkirk , 2000 ) . Typically , what makes a program alternative is the length and structure of the program , how the program is delivered , and the characteristics of the participants ( Rosenberg &; Sindelar , 2001 ) . AR programs are often shorter than traditional programs and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is facilitated by intensive field-based instruction and feedback . Eschewing much of the pedagogical coursework typical of most traditional initial preparation programs , AR programs emphasize enhanced supervision of candidates who receive on-the-job training as classroom teachers . It is believed that on-the-job training substitutes for the pedagogical training required by traditional programs ( Leal , 2004 ) . Finally , because AR programs are designed to supplement supply , they should ( and do ) recruit different types of teacher candidates than traditional programs : higher proportions of males , persons over 25 , members of culturally and linguistically diverse groups , and people who have had business and military experience ( Shen , 2000 ) . Finding a population of trainees is important for rural school districts because a program may be tailored to an idiosyncratic homegrown population . As we shall see , homegrown trainees are more likely to be committed to remaining in their communities and addressing the challenges of teaching in rural schools . <p> There has been rapid growth in AR programs , in both general and special education . Feistritzer , Haar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 persons have been licensed as teachers through AR programs . Currently , 43 states plus the District of Columbia ( DC ) offer AR programs ; in 1983 , by contrast , only 8 states offered such programs . Currently , in special education , 36 states and DC offer 225 programs , over 92% of which lead to generic special education certificates . Nationally , California ( 32.8% ) and Texas ( 16.6% ) account for most programs ( Rosenberg , Boyer , Sindelar , &; Misra , 2003 ) . Over 15% of currently certified special education teachers earned it through an AR ; among those who are unlicensed and seeking certification , 24% are enrolled in AR programs ( Connelly , 2003 ) . <p> Three overlapping factors have contributed to the growth of AR programs in special education . First and foremost is the continuing shortage of qualified teachers . Currently , over 50,000 special educators are less than fully certified for their work , and they are responsible for more than 800,000 students with disabilities ( U. S. Department of Education , n.d. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most notably college and university degree programs , are unable to meet the demand for qualified teachers , and alternative routes are most common in states with significant shortages . In California , Texas , Georgia , and Louisiana , four states with large numbers of special education AR programs , shortages average 20.2% ; by contrast , in states that offer no AR programs , shortages average 5.76% ( Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) . <p> Second , many AR programs have proven successful in increasing the number of teachers from culturally and linguistically diverse ( CLD ) groups . Over 86% of special education teachers and those in the traditional preparation pipeline are White , while the student population requiring special education services is approximately 38% nonwhite ( Tyler , Yzquierdo , Lopez-Reyna , &; Flippin , 2002 ) . AR programs help address the need for greater diversity in the teaching force by recruiting a higher percentage of CLD teachers than traditional training programs ( Connelly , 2003 ) . Moreover , of particular relevance to those in rural areas , those trained in AR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools where CLD students make up the majority ( Shen , 2000 ) . <p> The third factor contributing to the proliferation of AR programs is the strident criticism of the education establishment that questions the validity and usefulness of what is termed an over-regulated , self-serving , and exclusionary system of teaching preparation and licensure ( Goldhaber , 2004 ; Thomas B. Fordham Foundation , 1999 ) . These sentiments , also present in the language of NCLB , reflect the view that the education establishment mandates too many pedagogically based requirements in its training programs and that such requirements discourage talented , highly verbal , well-educated , liberal arts graduates from entering teaching . Although viewed by some as a means of de-professionalizing teaching ( Berry , 2004 ; Cochran-Smith &; Fries , 2001 ) , these criticisms have propelled many states to empower multiple providers to open a variety of paths to teaching . Not surprisingly , large numbers of individuals who have had limited contact with schools of education have entered the teaching force . <p> What we know about AR programs in special education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher preparation programs generally , no less about how alternative routes might compare to traditional preparation . Only recently has systematic information on special education AR programs begun to accumulate . Based upon a review of the few empirical studies of AR programs , Rosenberg and Sindelar ( 2001 ) concluded that for such efforts to be successful , there must be ( a ) meaningful school/university cooperation with time allocated to sustain partnerships ; ( b ) instructional content that is substantive , rigorous , and programmatic ; and ( c ) substantial use of on-site supervision and mentoring incorporating both university supervisors and building-based coaches . In an analysis of 101 current programs , we ( Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) found that most programs ( 71% ) involve partnerships among universities , state departments of education , and school districts . For the most part , these programs deliver instruction through a mix of university coursework , district-sponsored professional development , supervised fieldwork , and distance education . Financial support is provided through stipends and salaries , and programs are attracting non-traditional populations to the profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is great variability in the length and intensity of AR programs . Nearly half ( 45.3% ) of current programs require less than 3 months of preparation before trainees enter the classroom as teachers of record , and nearly 13% require no training at all . About 30% of the programs require no more than 18 months to complete , but most ( 60% ) require 19 to 36 months . Thus , while many programs offer adequate support , many rush candidates into challenging teaching situations with little preparation and few requirements for on-going professional development . Because of the potential for high attrition , fast-track programs may fail to increase the supply of special educators over the long term , thus exacerbating critical shortages by consuming limited training funds ( Billingsley , 2003 ; Katsiyannis , Zhang , &; Conroy , 2003 ; Miller , Brownell , &; Smith , 1999 ) . <p> Designing AR programs for rural schools . Rural districts face particular challenges in recruiting teachers , and their small and declining populations are an important element of the problem . In recent research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Wyckoff ( 2003 ) found that beginning teachers were highly likely to return to schools near their home towns . In that state , from 1998-99 to 2001-2002 , over 80% of beginning teachers took jobs within 40 miles of the high schools they attended . This phenomenon works to the advantage of larger districts with high proportions of high school graduates who go on to college . It works to the disadvantage of very small districts , where small numbers of high school graduates go on to college - and presumably even smaller numbers complete professional preparation and come home to teach . ( It also works to the disadvantage of large urban districts , where smaller than expected percentages of high school graduates go on to college . ) In rural districts , subsidizing the college education of local high school graduates in exchange for a promise of completing teacher preparation and returning home to teach seems like a promising policy strategy . However , the cost of subsidizing college education may be more than most districts can afford , and although statewide programs are commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knapp , 2001 ) , service requirements typically stipulate that recipients teach in the state - but not necessarily in high needs schools . <p> The initial cost of providing a highly qualified teacher should not be the only consideration in deciding on how best to invest the training funds available to districts . The teacher 's skill and impact on student achievement are critical , of course , as is their persistence in the field . An initial investment , however costly in the short term , may be increasingly cost effective as a teacher continues to work - and work effectively - in the district . An initial investment of $20,000 , say , may seem costly . However , if the investment yields a capable teacher who works in the district for 10 years , the annual cost of $2,000 seems more reasonable and affordable , particularly in contrast to the cost of repeated recruitment and hiring ( Texas Center for Educational Research , 2000 ) . <p> One problem with relying on graduates of traditional programs is that their supply has never been sufficient to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to be recent graduates of teacher education programs ( Boe , Cook , Bobbitt , &; Terhanian , 2000 ) . Furthermore , younger teachers are more likely to move from job to job , and more likely to leave teaching entirely ( Hanushck , Kain , &; Rivkin , 2004 ) . Alternative routes may be designed to address the particular needs of rural districts , and some elements of design seem more promising for rural districts than others . For example , programs for people who reside in the community seem more likely to succeed than programs that require recruitment of either teachers or trainees from outside the community . Prospective teachers are more likely to remain in schools in communities where they reside ( Dai , Denslow , Dewey , Sindelar &; Rosenberg , 2005 ) . For a number of reasons , paraprofessional step-up programs offer good potential for hard-to staff-schools . However , small rural districts may have few potential trainees ; moreover , because participants typically must complete an undergraduate degree program to be considered highly qualified , paraprofessional step-up programs take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily available to most rural districts , and the small number of potential trainees there makes them undesirable as a target for remote program delivery . ( In fact , paraprofessional step-up programs have worked best in larger districts within easy commuting distance of a campus ( Epanchin &; Wooley-Brown , 1993 ; Sindelar , Daunic , &; Rennells , in press ) . Moreover , step-up programs may be hard to replicate in the short term , particularly if all qualified trainees have been tapped for an initial training cohort . <p> Mid-career changers represent a second potential source of local participants for alternative teacher preparation . Because no degree program would be required and training would be shorter and more focused , this option may offer better potential to rural districts than programs for paraprofessionals . On the other , in a rural district , the available supply of professionals seeking new opportunities may be small ( and the proportion of adults with bachelor 's degrees is smaller in rural areas than is true nationally ( U. S. Census Bureau , n.d . ) ) . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be poorer bets for persisting as teachers than paraprofessionals . For one thing , individuals taking large pay cuts may return to their original careers when opportunities come available , and individuals whose original work had little in common with teaching are at greater risk for attrition than individuals who have experience in closely related fields ( Dai et al . ) . Generally speaking , districts are well advised to learn as much as possible about mid-career changers and to use such information in making decisions about whose training to support . In small towns and rural areas , however , this issue may be less of a problem in that applicants ' potential and motives for changing careers may be widely known . <p> Distance education and web-based courses have been touted as solutions to the program delivery problem ( Ludlow , 1999 ; Rosenkoetter , Irwin , &; Saceda , 2004 ) , but in the special education literature evidence of their efficacy is scarce . Western Governor 's University ( Garlett , Rosenberg , &; Madigan , 2004 ; U. S. Department of Education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses , extensive field work , and on-site supervision . WGU currently offers a program leading to K-8 certification and a mathematics endorsement , and soon will expand into special education . We see great promise in programs delivered remotely to candidates who are invested in both their communities and in teaching as a career . Conclusion <p> The passage of IDEA 2004 and the act 's alignment with NCLB has further solidified the federal role in defining what it means to be a highly qualified special education teacher . As the new IDEA comes on-line , several questions must be addressed . Will " highly qualified " actually translate to " high quality ? " Will the federal requirements to become a highly qualified special educator decrease the critical shortage of special education teachers in rural schools ? Or , will these shortages be exacerbated by driving away potential teacher candidates who do n't see the cost-benefit in meeting the additional subject matter requirements ? Will service delivery in rural areas for students with disabilities in high incidence areas have to be modified with increasing dependence on highly qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special educators serve in consultative roles ? What impact will service delivery modifications have on students ' access to FAPE and their overall academic achievement ? Will the federal emphasis and the rapid growth of alternatives to traditional teacher preparation produce high quality as well as highly qualified special education teachers in rural areas ? Or , will AR programs produce teachers unprepared to deal with the unique needs of students with disabilities in high incidence areas , and thus contribute to the already high attrition rates in rural schools ? <p> As a tandem , NCLB and IDEA 2004 are ushering in a new era in the recruitment , preparation , and retention of special education teachers for rural schools . The stage is set , the actors are in place , and the curtain is going up . We anxiously await the reviews . <p> Michael L.

@@4016841 Section : Bioremediation Advances COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY <p> Innovative development in recent years have greatly expanded the use of compost and the potential to recover significant portions of municipal solid waste . <p> Use of compost is no longer limited to its role as a soil amendment ; compost technologies are rapidly emerging as valuable tools in pollution prevention and pollution control . For years , proponents of compost pointed to its direct benefit of avoiding the landfill-ing of organic material and often cited enhanced nutrient enrichment in soils that have compost added . Although these benefits are impressive , the ultimate value of compost may be fully realized in its ability to be used in a myriad of innovative applications . Compost can be used for erosion control on highways , clean up of contaminants in storm water runoff , and remediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals or toxic organic compounds . <p> Concern for global warming adds yet an-other dimension to this discussion . The organic fraction of municipal solid waste ( MSW ) forms methane in the anaerobic environment of a landfill while it forms CO 2 in the aerobic environment of a compost facility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming as carbon dioxide , reduced impact on global warming is yet another benefit of composting . <p> Nationally , there are now over 3,000 community/commercial yard trimmings compost facilities , in part because 27 states have banned yard trimmings from landfills . Compost can also be made from food waste , mixed organic MSW , organic industrial sludges , and biosolids ( wastewater sludges ) . As yard trimmings and food waste together comprise about 23 percent of MSW generation , composting these items alone can contribute substantially to meeting state waste reduction and recycling . goals . <p> Recent advances in compost research have made it possible to compost other organic wastes in about the same time as yard trimmings and food waste , improving already cost-effective compost technology . The potential feedstock for compost , then , can be increased to include any paper that has been soiled with liquid or food waste , or that is not being recovered to be made into new paper products . By including paper , yard materials , and food waste , between 40 to 50 percent of municipal solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This article provides an overview of the innovative developments that have greatly expanded the use of compost and , with it , the potential to recover a significant portion of MSW . WHAT IS COMPOST ? <p> Compost is a recycled product made from the organic portion of MSW . Compost is often incorrectly confused with peat and mulch . Peat is partially decayed plant matter that is cut from marshes and wetlands and dried . Since formation of peat takes a long time , it can be classified as a nonrenewable , nonrecyclable resource . Mulch is either an organic or inorganic soil cover that is used to retard water evaporation and help maintain an even temperature . Organic mulch includes bark , wood chips and straw . Inorganic mulch includes plastic sheeting , pellets , gravel and stones . As organic wood mulch decays , it has a tendency to use the nitrogen already in the soil , reducing the amount available . This lack of available nitrogen can retard the growth of seedlings and young plants . Immature or incomplete compost is nothing more than an organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured compost . <p> Mature compost , on the other hand , is a humus product of microbiological degradation of plant or animal organic matter . In composting , temperatures of 130 to 150 degrees are reached by rapidly multiplying microorganism activity . At 150 degrees the moderate temperature or mesophilic microorganisms multiply with great rapidity . Unlike organic mulch , the chemical , physical and biological properties of mature , cured compost differ greatly from the raw materials used in the compost . Mature compost can degrade metals or totally eradicate many types of hydrocarbons and can permanently adsorb heavy metals making them unavailable to the metabolism of plants , man and animals . The same can not be said for mulch or peat . Different ingredients may be used to tailor the compost to satisfy specific demands for use in sandy soils , clay soils , steep slopes ( appropriate particle size ) , and for mechanical spreading ( small particle size and less than 40 percent moisture ) . This tailoring leads to the production of " designer compost . " WHAT ARE THE BENEFICIAL USES OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental value to its raw materials and has beneficial uses in soil enrichment , pollution prevention , and pollution reduction . When added to soils , compost adds organic bulk , increased earthworm populations , humus , and cation exchange capacity . Compost slowly and continuously releases nutrients over time , which is compatible with plant uptake , and reduces fertilizer requirements by about 50 percent . Compost increases water retention in both sandy and clay soils which results in a savings in water use . Compost has been shown to suppress plant and grass diseases and reduce the use of pesticides . Even after natural soil microbes have been reduced by application of chemical fertilizer , compost restores soil structure and microbial populations . <p> Compost also contributes to pollution prevention in several ways . Organic matter which is composted and , therefore , not sent to the landfill , helps avoid the creation of organic acids which contribute to leachate formation . The use of organic matter for corn-posting also means that there is less of this material in the landfill , thereby , reducing the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in global warming . Compost can also reduce both heavy metals and organic contaminants in stormwater runoff , preventing contamination of water resources . Compost reduces silting and erosion when applied to creek , lake , or river embankments or when used on roadsides and hillsides . <p> Compost contributes to pollution reduction of heavy metals as it binds heavy metals which are no longer bioavailable to humans or animals and can not migrate to water , or be taken up by plants . Compost contributes to pollution reduction of organic chemicals as it degrades or completely eliminates wood preservatives , petroleum products , pesticides and chlorinated and nonchlorinated hydrocarbons in soils . Compost also filters out odors and degrades volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) . TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES <p> The recent research of Dr. Francis Gouin ( 1995 ) at the University of Maryland found that the rate of compost formation in mixed organic MSW was dependent on the carbon/phosphorous ratio . An increase in phosphorous resulted in a faster composting rate and improved cost effectiveness . Gouin 's research indicates that the production time for compost could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three weeks when the amount of phosphorous is appropriately adjusted . When this research is completed , an analysis of comparative composting costs between MSW and other feedstocks should be made . If mixed organic MSW composting is shown to be competitive , it could become an additional solid waste management option for some communities . <p> Two important uses of high grade mature compost developed in the last few years ( Stewart ; 1994 ) are : 1 ) Removal of contaminants from the nonpoint source pollution of water at commercial , industrial , and federal installations and ; 2 ) A compost system to remove volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) . At one industrial site where this patented compost storm water filter system was installed , the materials removed were phosphorous , nutrients , solvents , pesticides , herbicides , silt , zinc , lead , cadmium and copper . The filter system cost was $17,300 while a similar industrial site on the same road was serviced by a holding pond which cost $45,000 . The same industrial research group developed a compost absorption and degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( See report on the filter system developed by William Stewart in this issue . ) <p> Dr. Michael Cole ( 1995 ) , from the University of Illinois , and others have used the hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms in mature compost to reduce or eliminate many toxic materials in contaminated soils . The four groups of contaminants treated were petroleum products , wood preservatives , chlorinated and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons , and pesticides ( fungicides , insecticides ) . Certainly a major goal of EPA activities is protection of human health , and reduction of pesticides is one important aspect . The National Academy of Sciences has stressed the danger of pesticides to young children since residues are not removed by washing organic compounds with water . <p> Dr. Rufus Chaney ( 1994 ) from the USDA Environmental Chemistry Laboratory and others were instrumental in providing data that eventually resulted in the removal of lead from gasoline . Lead toxicity was shown to affect the neurological development of young children . Recent work by Chaney showed that lead is adsorbed to iron-rich compost/soil and does not migrate to the water table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when soil is ingested by children , lead bound by iron-rich compost/soil has significantly reduced bioavailability in the gut as reflected by lead in bones , blood or tissue . <p> Dr. William Sopper ( 1993 ) , Pennsylvania State University , demonstrated one of the most dramatic soil remediation successes with compost in Palmerton , Pennsylvania where a zinc smelter had been in operation since 1898 . The site had no viable plant life , but in only 15 months both grass seed and alder tree seedlings responded to composted sludge/fly ash remediation . In this demonstration , Dr. Sopper made clear that municipal biosolids when tested and applied according to proper guidelines can be used to revegetate mine-damaged land in an " environmentally safe manner with no adverse effects on the vegetation , soil , or groundwater quality , and do not pose any significant threat to animal or human health . " Dr. Sop-per 's and Dr. Chaney 's work could have far reaching implications since in 1994 , the Department of Interior reported 300,000 abandoned mine sites on federal land . <p> Dr. Harry Hoitink ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease suppression from the use of mature compost . He stated that because of the use of compost , " Those truckloads of fumigants such as methyl bromide that all nursery crops ( and tobacco seedling plots ) used to need are all behind us now . " Also Dr. Herbert Bryan ( 1994 ) , University of Florida Tropical Research &; Education Center , reported , " In one of our more startling experiments , compost almost eliminated macrophomina fungus from a susceptible crop of beans ... untreated plot showed severe disease . " Dr. Bryan 's compost plot also required 50 percent less fertilizer . <p> The military ( Green &; Admire , 1995 ) is also using compost for a number of innovative applications . There is a major bioremediation effort using compost underway at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina . An abandoned taxiway contaminated with petroleum compounds is being treated with a ratio of 20 percent mature compost and five percent turkey manure to 75 percent contaminated soil , successfully leading to the degradation of the petroleum products . The compost bioremediation costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incineration at $60 per ton , including $10 per ton for clean topsoil ; estimated savings at this Air Force Base is about $200,000 . In addition , the U.S. Army is doing extensive research on the composting of explosives contaminated washout lagoons at Umatilla Army Depot in Oregon . The U.S. Navy is experimenting with a closed vessel system , composting mixtures of explosives-contaminated soil and compost feedstock at Bangor , Washington . CONCLUSION <p> The role of compost is no longer limited to its use as a soil amendment . Developments over the past two decades have greatly expanded the use of compost as a cost-effective technology in pollution prevention/control and bioremediation , and with these developments comes the added potential to recover a significant portion of our municipal solid waste stream . Compost has been shown to be effective at treating nonpoint source pollution ; removing VOCs ; degrading hydrocarbons and pesticides , and binding metals in contaminated soils ; suppressing plant disease ; and revegetating barren lands .

@@4002041 As the United States prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1955 act of civil disobedience by Rosa Parks , it is critical that any false emphases and flawed cultural myths associated with that December day be challenged and corrected . By exploring some of the historical-political , social , and personal influences that encouraged Parks 's refusal to move from her bus seat , it is possible to recognize in her deed the markings of a true prophetic act . <p> OVER THE YEARS , the historic event associated with Rosa Parks has been characterized in the following way : On December 1 , 1955 , in Montgomery , Alabama , a good-hearted , non-political , middle-aged seamstress was so tired from work that she refused to give up her seat on the bus ride home , indirectly setting in motion the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. ( n1 ) This version honors various admirable qualities found in Parks 's story , namely , her womanhood , her work ethic , and her physical tiredness after a hard day 's work . Unfortunately , it sidesteps the fundamental issue of racial injustice in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerent bus driver . It also ignores the mountain of evidence that insists Rosa Parks should never be characterized simply as a good-hearted seamstress . <p> As the United States prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience , it is critical that the flawed cultural myths associated with that December day be challenged and corrected . What happened on that bus was far from haphazard or coincidental . By examining some of the factors that influenced Parks 's refusal to give up her bus seat , it is possible to recognize the markings of a contemporary prophetic act . <p> To assist in this process , two precedents , one scriptural and one historical , will be briefly considered . First , the Hebrew Scriptures contain the account of Jeremiah 's purchase of the field in Anathoth ( Jeremiah 32:1-15 ) . This act was basically an event in the form of a simile , for it suggested that just as the Anathoth field was sold to Jeremiah , other plots of land near Jerusalem would also be bought and sold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger event , like the smashing of the potter 's vessel ( Jeremiah 19:1-13 ) that symbolized a coming destruction on a much larger scale . Rather it is the first purchase in what would be a long series of purchases occurring during an anticipated period of future restoration. ( n2 ) <p> Second , this incident involved the attribution of prophetic qualities to a type of action that might otherwise be considered quite ordinary . In normal times , buying a field of land was a commonplace occurrence . But , by buying a field already under the control of the invading Babylonian army , Jeremiah risked marking himself as a traitor . Only persons expecting to be able to retain ownership of their property under the conquering regime would have reasonably considered purchasing land at that time . Jeremiah , however , designated this act as symbolic of a promise made by the God of Israel that normal life would one day resume in the land. ( n3 ) Through this deliberate act , Jeremiah proclaimed a prophetic message of hope that would sustain the people during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be considered comes from an event that occurred 25 years prior to Parks 's act of civil disobedience , namely , the 1930 Salt March of Mahatma Gandhi . On March 12 , 1930 , Gandhi and 78 followers departed from his ashram outside Ahmedabad , intending to march 240 miles to the coastal city of Dandi . There Gandhi would lead the group in picking up natural sea salt , thus defying the oppressive Salt Laws and provoking a campaign of mass civil disobedience . Gandhi targeted these laws for three main reasons : they taxed the principal condiment of the poor ; they forbade the local manufacture of a bountiful natural resource ; and they fostered an unnecessary dependence on imported British goods. ( n4 ) The procession reached the sea on the evening of April 5 , but it was decided not to perform any acts of civil disobedience until the next day . Early on April 6 , Gandhi picked up some rough sea salt and reportedly said , " With this , I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil disobedience . By the end of the year , over 60,000 people were imprisoned for acts as seemingly minor as what Gandhi had done on the beach of Dandi . The impact of Gandhi 's prophetic act on both Indian and American history provides an excellent point of reference as we now return to Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience . <p> A key question associated with Rosa Parks concerns the reason why she refused to surrender her bus seat that day . The common explanation given is that she was tired . In responding to that perception , Parks adamantly insists her tiredness was not physical in nature . <p> People have said over the years that the reason I did not give up my seat was because I was tired . I did not think of being physically tired . My feet were not hurting . I was tired in a different way . I was tired of seeing so many men treated as boys and not called by their proper names or titles . I was tired of seeing children and women mistreated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired of Jim Crow laws , of legally enforced racial segregation. ( n6 ) <p> In contrast to any simplistic interpretation of Rosa Parks 's refusal to move , at least 18 different motivating factors can be given that played a part in the events of that day . They will now be briefly described under the categories of historical-political , social , and personal influences . HISTORICAL-POLITICAL INFLUENCES <p> An initial historical influence on Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience was the impact Brown v. Board of Education had upon all people striving to remove the unfair laws of segregation . This landmark Supreme Court ruling ( handed down on May 17 , 1954 ) rejected the long-held belief that " separate-but-equal " educational programs were constitutional . It prompted a negative backlash among many White Southerners ; however it gave hope and encouragement to those suffering under racist and prejudicial laws , such as laws requiring segregated bus service . <p> A second influential historical event occurred about 15 months later , when an all-White jury acquitted two men accused of the brutal murder of Emmett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 14-year-old youth from Chicago , was dared to say " Bye , baby " to a White shopkeeper in Money , Mississippi . He was later brutally murdered reportedly by the woman 's husband and a brother-in-law . Till 's mother demanded an open casket funeral in Chicago , which not only led to photographs of Till 's mangled body being printed in the media but also brought national and international criticism of Mississippi 's segregationist society . Rosa Parks was well aware of the details of this brutal event . <p> Another influence involves the activity of the Women 's Political Council ( WPC ) of Montgomery . At first glance , this seems to have been only an indirect influence since Rosa Parks was not a member of the group . However , the WPC had been in existence since 1946 with its primary focus being the removal of laws of segregation , especially in relation to the bus system . They had been entertaining the idea of a bus boycott for years and , under the leadership of Jo Ann Robinson , had begun shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Given such mutual interests of Rosa Parks and the WPC , it would seem likely that Parks was aware of , and at least indirectly influenced by , some of the work of Jo Ann Robinson 's group . <p> A fourth historical influence is connected with the stories of the two other African American women who , in the months prior to Rosa Parks 's incident , were arrested for failing to move from their seats when ordered to do so by White bus drivers . On March 2 , 1955 , a 15-year-old high school student named Claudette Colvin was told to move from her seat in the non-reserved section of the bus , simply to accommodate White passengers with no seat . Colvin refused , so the driver tracked down a policeman and had Colvin arrested and forcibly taken away in a patrol car . In the end , because she was a minor , Colvin was found guilty of violating state laws , made to pay a fine , and remanded to her parents ' care . <p> The second case involved an 18-year-old girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vacate her bus seat . She was seated in the non-reserved section , but was fined for not obeying the bus driver 's request that she move farther back in the bus . For the Montgomery branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , these incidents proved to be " trial runs " for envisioning how orchestrated efforts might succeed in removing the unjust laws of segregation. ( n7 ) <p> Many have wondered whether Rosa Parks was prompted by the NAACP local leadership to initiate action against the bus company . It is clear from Parks 's own comments that such was not the case . <p> People have asked me if it occurred to me then that I could be the test case the NAACP had been looking for . I did not think about that at all . In fact if I had let myself think too deeply about what might happen to me , I might have gotten off the bus . But I chose to remain. ( n8 ) <p> It must be conceded , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the NAACP and her friendship with chapter President E. D. Nixon significantly influenced her . One of her principal duties was cataloguing the cases of discrimination and racial violence in their community . This included many instances of lynching , rape , flogging , and unsolved murders . Thus , when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in July 1955 that segregated bus seating was unconstitutional , considering ways to desegregate the Montgomery buses became an important topic discussed at NAACP meetings at which Parks took all the minutes . <p> A final historical-political influence to be mentioned here is the crucial impact of Parks 's attendance at the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle , Tennessee . Founded by Myles Horton , the Highlander Folk School strove to gather together integrated groups of people committed to social activism and educational reform . In the summer of 1955 , a two-week workshop was being held on " Radical Desegregation : Implementing the Supreme Court Decision . " Horton called Virginia Foster Durr , about whom more will be said later , to see if she knew of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . She quickly recommended Rosa Parks and even arranged to find a sponsor to cover her transportation costs. ( n9 ) <p> Parks agreed to attend this workshop , even over the objections of her husband and despite the fact that it required her to take a leave of absence from her employer . The sense of genuine community and social concern that Parks experienced at Highlander left a strong impression upon her , which she keenly felt once she returned back home to her job and daily life in segregated Montgomery . SOCIAL AND FAMILY INFLUENCES <p> Rosa Parks often spoke about the women and men she admired and whose example she sought to emulate . These people played a supporting role in the 1955 drama on the Montgomery city bus . An initial social influence worth mentioning was Rosa Parks 's friendship with Virginia Durr , a committed activist for civil rights . A mutual friend introduced Rosa Parks to Durr , who soon discovered that Parks was an excellent seamstress and hired her to do alterations on family dresses . Soon the two women spent much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durr was a mentor to her and one of the closest female friends she had in Montgomery. ( n10 ) <p> A second social influence on Rosa Parks was her inspirational encounter in 1955 with Septima Clark , who worked with Myles Horton as director of the workshops at the Highlander Folk School . Clark was a born activist and strong proponent of integration across American society . The Highlander experience of interracial camaraderie coupled with learning from women of conviction such as Septima Clark had a definite impact on Rosa Parks 's worldview and commitment to social justice . <p> A further social influence on Rosa Parks was her friendship with and admiration for E. D. Nixon , the leader of the local branch of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and one of the founders of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP . Parks had known Nixon since 1943 , working closely with him as secretary of the local NAACP chapter and advisor for the NAACP Youth Council. ( n11 ) She even followed him as his executive secretary when he was elected president of the Progressive Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she worked for Nixon without compensation . <p> In suggesting a fourth influence on Rosa Parks 's life , the focus now shifts from colleagues to members of her immediate family , beginning with her brother , Sylvester . When Sylvester returned from military service in World War II , the hypocrisy and prejudice prevalent in their home community was hard for both siblings to bear . Black soldiers , who had fought bravely in defense of the United States , often returned home to a nation that considered them " uppity " and " troublemakers " if they wore their uniforms in public . Uncomfortable with such prejudicial treatment , in late 1945 Sylvester packed up his wife and two children and moved to Detroit , where he took a job at a Chrysler factory . The yoke of segregation thus caused some of Parks 's closest relatives to flee her home community . <p> An additional influence on Rosa Parks was the courage she witnessed in her mother , Leona McCauley , and her maternal grandparents . In her book Quiet Strength , Parks speaks proudly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and emphasis on believing in oneself " even while living under racist conditions . " She also mentions how her Grandma Rose was an example of care and love while still being strong-willed and a strict disciplinarian. ( n12 ) But then she moves on to the figure of her grandfather , Sylvester Edwards , who was someone that Rosa Parks consistently describes as an influential figure in her life . Born a slave , Sylvester Edwards was light-skinned and dared to break the social taboos of the day by shaking hands with Whites and calling them by their first names . But the cruelty he had personally experienced in his life made him quite hostile toward Whites . He was adamant that his children or grand children never work as domestic servants in White households . Parks makes these telling remarks : " His memory will always be with me . While I do not think I inherited his hostility , my mother and I both learned not to let anyone mistreat us . It was passed down almost in our genes . " ( n13 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rosa Parks 's husband , Raymond . Almost exactly ten years older than Rosa , Raymond was a barber by trade and a charter member of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP . When they were first introduced , Raymond was fixated on bringing about justice for the recently imprisoned Scottsboro Boys , even though to do so was to risk being beaten or killed . In the years prior to December 1955 , Raymond 's commitment to civil rights and his active involvement in the NAACP were probably the dominant forces in Rosa Parks 's evolving spirit of civil disobedience . To quote her directly , Parks said : " He was the first man of our race , aside from my grandfather , with whom I actually discussed anything about the racial conditions . He was the first real activist I ever met. " ( n14 ) PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND CHARACTER TRAITS <p> One difference between descriptions of prophetic activity from biblical eras and modern eras is that , in the former , the dynamic of psychological motivation is left relatively unexplored . It is one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be quite another thing to attempt to characterize the emotional and internal influences active in any specific act of volition . But since Rosa Parks has been asked so often to explain why she did what she did , her responses , plus comments made by her friends and associates , provide excellent source material for recognizing a number of personal factors that can be said to have influenced Parks 's act of civil disobedience . <p> An initial personal influence , and the one that is most commonly mentioned , is that she was physically tired after a busy day of work . If physical fatigue was a factor in Parks 's decision not to surrender her seat , it was a fairly remote one . It is true that she had worked all day , including a " working lunch " in the office of attorney Fred Gray , and she was anxious to get home to rest for a brief period before leading the regular Thursday evening NAACP Youth Council meeting . But on that particular day , it was clear that she was burdened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal influence was the disparity Parks had experienced between different bus systems in her own community . In 1941 , Parks got a job at Maxwell Field , a nearby Army Air Corps base . On the U.S. military base , she rode on an integrated trolley , often sitting side by side with White colleagues and enjoying conversation together . Once she left the base , however , she was forced to ride on segregated city buses . Parks felt this discrepancy to be a personal " humiliation " and insists that the experience opened her eyes by showing her " an alternative reality to the ugly racial policies of Jim Crow . " ( n15 ) <p> A third personal influence is a quality of Rosa Parks that is frequently mentioned by those who know her well , that is , a steely inner strength . Her long-time associate , Elaine Steele , has remarked that Parks is a person who is very peaceful but with great power . <p> She can very quietly say " no " or " I prefer not " and you know instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way the bus driver must have felt on that particular day when he asked " Are you going to move ? " and she said " No , I am not . " He did n't have to debate the point any further. ( n16 ) <p> Along with Parks 's inner strength , a fourth personal influence was her strong sense of pride . One minor incident points this out . When Parks accepted the scholarship to attend the Highlander Folk School , she supposedly accepted luggage and a swimsuit from Virginia Durr ; however , Parks disputes this detail in her autobiography . Durr responded in her own book , saying : <p> Rosa Parks is one of the proudest people I 've ever known in my life . She hated to admit that she did n't have a suitcase or bathing suit or money . It was painful for her . She was a very proud woman , so all of this had to be accomplished with a great deal of tact , which I am not noted for. ( n17 ) <p> While learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives credit to Miss Alice Winter , one of her early schoolteachers . Parks comments that she learned at Miss White 's school that she was " a person with dignity and self-respect " and that she should not set her sights lower than anybody else just because of her race. ( n18 ) <p> As a corollary to this strong sense of pride , an additional personal influence was the fact that Rosa Parks had a lingering resentment toward James F. Blake , the bus driver who confronted her on December 1 , 1955 . She did not know Blake personally ; she did not even learn his name until her subsequent trial . But they had already had an unfortunate encounter 12 years prior. ( n19 ) One sad feature of segregation was the habit of many bus drivers to require Black passengers to pay for their ticket at the front of the bus , before disembarking and reboarding at the rear of the bus . James Blake had a reputation for being especially abusive toward African American women , as well as taking malicious pleasure in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then leaving them stranded before they could reboard at the rear . <p> One November day in 1943 , Rosa Parks boarded a bus through the front door and moved to stand in the aisle in the appropriate section in the rear . She had done this because there was no way to enter the bus from the rear , since every seat in the back of the bus and place in the rear stairwell and aisle were already full . James Blake was the driver that day and demanded that she exit immediately . When she refused , he told her to get off of " his " bus . Parks refused to move . Blake stood up and began pulling on her coat sleeve . She warned him not to strike her and said that she would leave . However , she further infuriated Blake by intentionally dropping her purse near the front of the bus and briefly sitting in a " Whites Only " seat before finally exiting the bus . For the next dozen years , Parks consciously avoided riding in any bus driven by Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous incident of 1955 was only possible because Parks had neglected to notice who was driving the bus when it stopped to pick up passengers near her place of work . Her act of civil disobedience was surely influenced by a long-remembered sense of moral outrage felt toward James Blake . <p> A sixth , and , in my opinion , the most important personal influence affecting Rosa Parks 's decision not to move from her bus seat was her deeply rooted Christian faith . Invariably , when Parks is asked about the events that day , she uses language that is faith-based and confessional in nature . When a schoolgirl from Detroit wrote to Parks , asking what gave her the courage to say " No " and not move to the back of the bus , she replied : <p> God has always given me the strength to say what is right . I did not get on the bus to get arrested ; I got on the bus to go home . Getting arrested was one of the worst days in my life . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong believer in God , I knew that He was with me , and only He could get me through the next step . <p> I had no idea that history was being made . I was just tired of giving in . Somehow , I felt that what I did was right by standing up to that bus driver . I did not think about the consequences . I knew that I could have been lynched , manhandled , or beaten when the police came . I chose not to move , because I was right . When I made that decision , I knew that I had the strength of God and my ancestors with me. ( n20 ) <p> According to her biographer , Douglas Brinkley , " faith in God was never the question for Rosa Parks ; it was the answer . " ( n21 ) <p> In summary , what is the significance of this survey of possible influences shaping Rosa Parks 's decision not to surrender her bus seat ? Consider the fact that when material from the Hebrew Scripture is studied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process has occurred even before one begins . This is because all descriptions of biblical prophetic activity come to us in a redacted form . The material has been edited and shaped according to implicit criteria , such as the goal of authenticating Jeremiah as a true prophetic figure and presenting his messages as being valid expressions of the word and will of God for the Judahite community . <p> This is quite different from considerations of modern prophetic acts . While redaction of contemporary historical events can and does occur , exegetes of such events are also active participants in determining the events ' overall significance . They seek out first-person accounts , read biographical material , interview witnesses , and reach conclusions based on varying degrees of critical research . Moreover , the question of " Why did she or he do that ? " is always asked of modern prophetic acts with the expectation that an answer can be discovered . By comparison , this question can only be answered in a speculative fashion in reference to biblical prophetism . Therefore , it is prudent to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern figures . Far from secularizing or demythologizing examples of contemporary prophetism , such in-depth , historical-critical , psychological , and sociological examination helps in rendering judgment as to their authenticity and efficacy , while possibly shedding light on what may have been involved in similar prophetic examples from the Hebrew Scripture . RECOGNIZING THE PROPHETIC QUALITY OF ROSA PARKS 'S ACT <p> In order to offer a provisional evaluation of whether Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience should be considered a modern prophetic act , the earlier biblical and historical precedents will now be revisited . In recalling the prophet Jeremiah 's decision to purchase the field in Anathoth , it was mentioned that making this land purchase during a time of enemy siege was considered dangerous and foolhardy . It created the appearance that Jeremiah was in league with the Babylonians , hoping to retain possession of the land once the invading army conquered Jerusalem . As such , Jeremiah 's prophetic act was done at great personal risk . The same could be said of Parks 's prophetic act . By refusing to move , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of being forever redefined as that of a questionable troublemaker . In the aftermath of her act , Parks received a barrage of death threats. ( n22 ) She went against her husband 's wishes by her willingness to become a public figure , enduring his repeated warning , " Rosa , the White folks will kill you . Rosa , the White folks will kill you . " Her act led directly to her losing her job and her husband 's resignation from his barber 's job. ( n23 ) She also knew that she was endangering her entire family , including her frail mother . Yet she agreed to make her legal case a means to challenge the unjust status quo . <p> Parks 's act and Jeremiah 's purchase of the Anathoth field are also similar in being prophetic acts of hope in times of crisis . Both involved ordinary activities ( the buying and selling of land , riding home from work on public transportation ) whose " ordinariness " belied the crisis settings at hand ( siege of Jerusalem , Montgomery 's laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embody Jeremiah 's promise that one day , " houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land " ( Jeremiah 32:15b ) . Similarly , refusing to be coerced to vacate her bus seat became a means to embody a social vision that no longer allowed rules about a person 's skin color to dictate whether a wide array of services or common courtesies will be offered . Both acts took a present event to show forth a possible future reality . And both acts relied on a foundation of communal faith and religious conviction . <p> Comparisons with Gandhi 's Salt March of 1930 are also instructive . Both Gandhi 's march and Parks 's refusal to move were public acts , performed by people considered to be weak or non-threatening by the dominant social powers . Both were challenging a relatively minor law but one that touched on fundamental quality of life issues for the oppressed population . And both acted out of sincere faith foundations and philosophical convictions , consciously choosing to defy laws that were unjust so that all people might experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary prophetic acts , these comparisons to biblical and historical precedents are helpful , yet not fully adequate in themselves . Theologian Paul Tillich has suggested that prophetic moments are also crisis moments , in which , at the " fullness of time , " the negativities of society are challenged by bearers of a prophetic spirit . He described such prophetic activity as kairotic in nature , transformational and directed toward what is unconditional. ( n24 ) Is it then possible to speak about a kairos moment occurring on that December day in Montgomery , Alabama ? <p> Throughout Brinkley 's biography , one recurrent question is whether or not Parks 's actions were premeditated . In his opinion , the answer is a clear " no . " As he puts it , a " lifetime 's education in injustice -- from her grandfather 's nightly vigils to the murder of Emmett Till -- had strengthened her resolve to act when the time came . " ( n25 ) Martin Luther King , Jr. , echoed these sentiments in his book Stride toward Freedom , when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulated indignities of days gone and the boundless aspirations of generations yet born . She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny . She had been tracked down by the Zeitgeist -- the spirit of the time . " ( n26 ) <p> Although she never uses the specific term kairos , this sense of the " fullness of time " is present in Parks 's own summary of her action : " God provided me with the strength I needed at the precise time when conditions were ripe for change , " ( n27 ) Knowing that other women at other times had reacted to bus segregation in the same way as she had , but without it leading to an effective , enduring bus boycott , Parks came to recognize a kairotic quality to the events associated with her prophetic act that day . <p> Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience merits recognition as an example of a contemporary prophetic act . It was a deliberate act of witness , performed by a person grounded in a faith community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . The most fitting way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Parks 's historic act is to peel back the sentimental veneer from our recollections of that day . It is time to acknowledge finally the depth of prophetic spirit active both in Parks 's faithful witness and in the larger community around her . <p> Before leaving the story of Rosa Parks , one final moment of irony is worthy of mention . The Montgomery bus boycott lasted for 13 months , until the Supreme Court rejected the segregationist position of the Montgomery City Commission and ordered that by December 20 , 1956 , all the buses be integrated by law . On the morning of December 21 , 1956 , a reporter and photographer from Look magazine knocked on Rosa Parks 's door and persuaded her to have her picture taken riding a bus on that first day of integration . The famous subsequent photograph , showing Rosa Parks glancing out a window with a White male passenger seated in the row behind her , just happened to be taken on a bus driven that day by @ @ @ @ 
@@4018741 Section : REPORT ON REPORTS <p> Can agricultural growth be sustained ? More specifically , have the efforts of the last several decades to put in place a global agricultural research system established the research capacity that will enable the farmers of the developing world to meet future demands ? <p> This report , which summarizes and interprets the research policy recommendations made by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) Third System Review Panel , attempts to respond to these questions. ( n1 ) PMahendra M. Shah served as executive secretary of the review panel , with Maurice F. Strong as chair . The panel addressed issues that the system of international agricultural research centers , organized under CGIAR , will face as it attempts to respond to the food security , resource management , and poverty reduction challenges of the first several decades of the 21st century . The report also attempts to fill a broader public information function by highlighting the unique role and accomplishments of the CGIAR system . It addresses the resources that will need mobilization if the international system , together with the National Agricultural Research Systems ( NARS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The report is well written . The figures , tables , and boxes that accompany the text are particularly useful . Inventing the CGIAR System <p> CGIAR 's vision of a global agricultural research system emerged in the early 1960s as a result of growing concern about a potential world food crisis generated by rapid population growth . Freedom from want had been part of the vision of the architects of new post-World War II international institutions . In the immediate post-war years , much of the institutional responsibility for meeting world food needs fell on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) . But John Boyd Orr , the first director general of FAO , burdened by the memory of the agricultural surpluses of the 1930s , was highly critical of the view that knowledge and technology represented a serious constraint on agricultural production capacity . In the first two decades after World War II , assistance for agriculture was conducted largely in a technology transfer and community development mode. ( n2 ) <p> The inadequacy of these policies led to a reexamination of assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be readily exported from countries that had achieved high levels of agricultural productivity to low productivity countries and regions . The result was the emergence of a new perspective : Agricultural technology , particularly yield-enhancing biological technology , is highly location specific . Evidence also accumulated to the effect that only limited productivity gains could be achieved by the reallocation-or the more effective use-of the resources available to peasant producers in poor countries . <p> A new view also emerged on the role of peasant producers in agricultural development . In early post-war development literature , peasant producers were viewed as obstacles , " bound by custom and tradition , " to agricultural development . In an iconoclastic work published in 1964 , Theodore W. Schultz , who subsequently received a Nobel Prize for his work on agricultural development , advanced a " poor but efficient " view of peasant producers. ( n3 ) He viewed them as making efficient use of the resources at hand but living in societies in which productivity enhancing high-payoff inputs had not been made available to them . Schultz insisted that the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproducible resources . Although the services of nature , particularly land and water , would be essential for sustaining agricultural production , the sources of growth would be based on new knowledge and new technology . <p> These insights , gained from experience and analysis , shaped the response of the international community to the food crises of the 1960s and the 1970s . In 1969 , the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations , the World Bank , FAO , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , and a number of economic assistance agencies in developing countries held consultations that led to the creation of CGIAR . The four international agricultural research centers already established by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations-the International Rice Research Institute ( IRRI ) in the Philippines , the International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat ( CIMMYT ) in Mexico , the International Center for Tropical Agriculture ( CIAT ) in Colombia , and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture ( IITA ) in Nigeria-were brought into CGIAR as the first research units in the new system. ( n4 ) <p> During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct research on additional commodities ( potatoes , cassava , bananas , plantain , livestock , and livestock disease ) ; resources ( soils , water , forest , marine , and genetic ) ; and on agricultural , food , and research policies ( see Figure 1 on this page ) . The establishment of the newer centers reflected a shift from an almost exclusive focus on the enhancement of crop and animal productivity to a broader research program that included the resource and environmental bases on which agricultural production rests . By the late 1990s , approximately 30 percent of the research budget of CGIAR centers was directed to areas of environmental protection and biodiversity preservation . Impact Assessment <p> There is now a large body of research indicating exceptionally high social rates of return to agricultural research in developing countries. ( n5 ) The studies suggest average rates of return upward of 40 percent for a wide range of commodities . The report by Shah and Strong makes brief references to the specific impacts of CGIAR research ( p. 27-32 ) . Because of the close articulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easy to isolate their separate contributions . <p> There can be no question , however , about the importance of the contributions of CGIAR research to the growth of production of the most important food commodities in developing countries . For example , a study conducted in the early 1990s indicated that wheat varieties developed through the CIMMYT-NARS collaborative research network accounted for more than 40 percent of the 13,000 wheat varieties released in developing countries between 1966 and 1990 . In addition , varieties developed by using CIMMYT-NPRS germplasm as parents in NARS adaptive research accounted for about 25 percent of all varieties released in developing countries . Thus , about two-thirds of all wheat varieties in developing counties from 1966 to 1990 were directly or indirectly based on germplasm developed by the CIMMYT-NARS network . In addition , varieties containing CYMMT-based genetic material had a significant yield advantage relative to varieties containing only locally based genetic material. ( n6 ) Studies of other major commodities , such as rice , maize , and potatoes , indicate comparable results . <p> The contribution of CGIAR to strengthening national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention than the direct impact of center research on production . CGIAR centers serve as nodes for a global system for the exchange of scientific and technical information and genetic material . There is a continuous exchange of scientific , technical , and administrative staff among the several institutes and between the CGIAR system and agricultural research systems in both developed and developing countries . The world 's largest collection of genetic resources for the major crop plants are now located at CGIAR centers . The mission of the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute is to strengthen international collaboration in the conservation and use of plant genetic resources and to disseminate knowledge and technologies relevant to improved conservation and use of plant genetic resources . A continuing concern that has never been fully resolved is the relationship between increased agricultural production and the broader problems of rural poverty . A benefit that has frequently been overlooked is the impact of CGIAR-NARS research on the urban poor . In developing countries , the very poor frequently spend more than half of any incremental income on basic food commodities . Without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CGIAR research , basic food prices in many of the poorest countries would be substantially higher. ( n7 ) However , agricultural research has been a blunt instrument with which to address the problems of resource-poor families in rural areas . <p> The member institutes and centers of the CGIAR system also deserve a number of criticisms . They have often been tempted to announce premature " breakthroughs of the year . " An example was the premature announcement by IIRI in 1993 of a new rice biotype that would result in dramatically higher yields . Numerous other examples could be cited . The temptation for premature publicity about potential breakthroughs is often driven by national donor agency pressures to demonstrate to their constituencies the importance of their support for the CGIAR research effort . A second , valid criticism is that institute directors and scientists have , at times , acted as if they were competitors rather than collaborators with NARS , thereby giving inadequate recognition to the work of national scientists . A New Mission <p> What about the future ? Will the CGIAR system be as effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been in the past ? What are those challenges ? Gordon Conway , president of the Rockefeller Foundation , has called for a " doubly green revolution " that will contribute effectively to poverty reduction by enhancing food production. ( n8 ) The environmental community has called repeatedly for a stronger ecological approach in the CGIAR research agenda . <p> The intensification of agricultural production associated with the adoption of larger yielding crop varieties has generated a number of environmental concerns . Some of these concerns are related to the expansion of irrigated areas on which many of the higher yielding crops grow . Irrigation systems are often poorly designed , managed , and maintained . Overexploitation of groundwater in such areas as northwestern India and north China results in falling groundwater levels . Expansion of gravity irrigation systems in areas , such as the Indus River basin in south-central Asia , results in salinization . Intensive use of fertilizer and pesticides have resulted in soil degradation and water pollution . There have also been negative impacts on fish culture , livestock , and human health in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CGIAR centers . Recognition of problems associated with intensification of crop reduction has resulted in a substantial broadening of the research agenda at CGIAR centers . By the late 1990s , research directly related to productivity enhancement had fallen to less than 40 percent of center budgets. ( n9 ) <p> The review panel recommended a new mission statement , which CGIAR has adopted , " to contribute to food security and poverty eradication in developing countries through research , partnership , capacity building , and policy support promoting sustainable agricultural development based on environmentally sound management of natural resources " ( p. 330 ) . It insisted that the specific commodity approach taken by many of CGIAR centers would not be sufficient to meet the demands of population and income growth and to protect and enhance the agricultural resource base . The panel proposed " a far more holistic approach to the interlinked problems , with sustainable agriculture providing the common thread ( p. 33 ) . <p> In its deliberations , the panel found it necessary to struggle with a number of difficult issues . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been forced to work . Since the early 1990s , when several new natural resource-oriented institutes were added to the system , CGIAR experienced increasing financial stress ( see Figure 1 ) . Financial support declined continuously throughout most of the 1990s . Since the end of the Cold War , contributions by the United States have fallen from a commitment of 25 percent of CGIAR 's budget to less than 15 percent . The decline in U.S. support has made it easier for other developed countries to reduce their support . In Germany , a green movement , critical of modern biological and chemical technology in agriculture , made it easy for a government burdened with the heavy resource demands associated with reunification to reduce its commitment to the support of international agricultural research . Among the developed countries , only Japan , Denmark , and a few others increased their support for CGIAR during the 1990s . Without enhanced support from the World Bank , CGIAR 's financial crisis would have been even deeper . <p> A second issue that the panel struggled with was the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green revolution technology , based on the application of the older Mendelian genetics , had not escaped controversy . Some critics labeled it a western technology inappropriately imposed on nonwestern societies . It was criticized for contributing to loss of genetic diversity and for a bias against the poor. ( n10 ) The panel attempted to tread cautiously among embracing the potential of the new biotechnology to release biological constraints on crop and animal productivity , concern about possible health and environmental impacts , and the inadequate regulatory regimes to monitor release of new biotechnology products for commercial use . That these deliberations were under way during an escalating " food fight " between the United States and several European Community member countries contributed to the caution with which the review panel approached the issue of biotechnology. ( n11 ) <p> A third , closely related issue that confronted the panel was the issue of intellectual property rights of the technology developed at CGIAR centers . The urgency of intellectual property rights arises from the much larger role that private sector research and development is playing in the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in developed countries and in some of the larger and more advanced developing countries . One of the concerns addressed by the critics is farmer access and ability to pay . " Those who oppose protection argue that the protection shifts control of resources from farmers and local communities to large corporations . It also tends to skew the research agenda to favor industrial agriculture , bypassing the community and diversity-based agriculture that , over the generations , has fostered and maintained genetic diversity " ( p. 46 ) . <p> A related concern is the excessively broad intellectual property rights granted by the U.S. national patent office on genetic material. ( n12 ) The panel had to confront the issue that failure to establish intellectual property rights on the product of its research could mean that it would lose control of its own research results . It will not be able to give away what it does not own . The panel " urged CGIAR to create a legal entity to hold and manage the international patent rights on behalf of the centers " ( p. 47 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a licensing arrangement that would ensure that technology developed by CGIAR centers would be freely available . Several European donors to the system opposed this recommendation . The governing body of the CGIAR system has not yet acted on the recommendation , in spite of its urgency . <p> Another issue , which the review panel failed to confront , is the governance and structure of the CGIAR system . It is generally acknowledged , even by its strongest supporters , that the system has great difficulty arriving at and implementing strategic decisions . The independent corporate identity of the constituent institutes has the great strength that research priority decisions can be made at the level at which the science is actually done , and by those with the imagination and capacity to know what is feasible . This independence has been eroded as the core budgets of the centers have declined relative to external project funding by donors . As the system has grown , the Technical Advisory Committee has found it increasingly difficult to advise the governing body on scientific and organizational issues . CGIAR has found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more productive research objectives and almost impossible to reorganize or close the several centers that have been unproductive or whose missions are no longer relevant . If the CGIAR system is to meet the challenges outlined in the third system review or in the report by Shah and Strong , it will need to address the issue of its own governance and advisory structure with greater determination than it has demonstrated in the past . A Second Green Revolution ? <p> The developed country donors to the CGIAR system have become too complacent about its capacity to meet the demands placed on the world 's farmers to meet the food demands arising out of population and income growth and to navigate the transition to a sustainable system of agricultural production over the next half century. ( n13 ) <p> The accomplishments of the past half-century are impressive . World population rose from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 6.0 billion in 2000 . In spite of rapid population growth , global average per-capita food availability rose from less than 2,400 calories to morP than 2,700 . Food grains have become available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . Population growth will likely add in the neighborhood of 3.0 billion people to world population by 2050 . Income growth in poor countries will also add substantially to food demand. ( n14 ) <p> In the early 1960s , it was not difficult to anticipate the sources of the increase in agricultural production during the next several decades . Advances in crop production would come from expansion in irrigated areas , from more intensive application of fertilizer and crop protection chemicals , and from the development of crop varieties more responsive to fertilizer and management . Advances in animal production would come from genetic improvements and advances in animal nutrition and animal health . At a more fundamental level , increases in grain yields would occur from changes in plant architecture that make possible higher plant populations per hectare and by increasing the ratio of grain to total dry matter . Increases in production of animals and animal products would come about by decreasing the proportion of feed devoted to animal maintenance and by increasing the proportion used to produce useable animal products . <p> Today , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sources of increase in crop and animal production over the next half century. ( n15 ) Neither expansion of cultivated areas nor increases in irrigated areas will contribute substantially to agricultural production in the future . There are severe physiological constraints to increasing the grain-to-dry-matter ratio or to reducing the percentage of animal feed devoted to animal maintenance . Constraints are already evident in terms of a reduction in the incremental yield increase from fertilizer application . There are also preliminary indications of a decline in agricultural research productivity-measured in terms of the number of scientist research years to achieve incremental gains in crop and animal productivity . <p> It is possible , within another decade , that advances in molecular biology and genetic engineering will reverse the urgency of the above concerns . However , the products of genetic engineering now on the market , primarily plant protection and animal health products , are not contributing to raising yield ceilings above the levels achieved with the older Mendelian technologies .

The challenge of the future will be to make it a truly global system , to reform its governance and management , and to provide the substantial new resources necessary if the world 's farmers are to meet the demands that their societies will place on them . International assistance agencies and national governments need to direct renewed attention to reversing the recent decline in donor support for agricultural development and to strengthening the national agricultural research systems in the poor countries of the world . <p> There are other issues that will be impossible to resolve within the CGIAR system of agricultural research centers .

But the broader issues of poverty reduction and environmental protection must be addressed by policies and programs designed to specifically confront these issues .

@@4012241 Although teaching and research in the arts and sciences are the sine qua non of the modern university in the United States , that tradition has increasingly come under attack. 1 Part of the problem is that many people , including some faculty members , define the teaching and research roles in dichotomous terms . Moreover , many faculty members " often behave as though only one role really matters -- that of research , of creating new knowledge . " 2 This view of teaching and research poses a complex set of problems that broadly affects higher education . Among other things , it calls us to reexamine the message we convey to junior faculty members through the promotion and tenure process ; it impacts the strategies we employ to invigorate unproductive faculty members ; it calls into question how we enhance research productivity without compromising our academic mission ; and it affects the very nature of the curriculum by impacting our perceptions of what we should teach . Our ability to respond to these challenges will not only affect the future vitality of the arts in higher education , it will significantly influence how the arts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the years to come . <p> This article focuses on two of these challenges . My purpose is to call attention to emerging policy issues that arise from a changing climate for research and teaching in higher education . By research , I mean all forms of creative and scholarly inquiry in which new knowledge is created , regardless of whether those intellectual products take form in print , performance , production , or practice . In higher education , we teach to foster intellectual development and expertise through the study of advanced disciplinary knowledge and skills . Teaching includes all activities that support and give structure to learning , including but not limited to what goes on in the classroom , in the studio , on the stage , at the library , in the laboratory , out in the field , in faculty offices , in galleries , and throughout the corridors of our institutions . <p> I will argue that pressures within and outside higher education require arts education policymakers to reconceptualize the relationship between faculty research and teaching . Out of necessity , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the known and unknown are simultaneously investigated through student and faculty exchange . Our traditional concepts of " the core curriculum " will require redefinition to face the rapid expansion of disciplinary knowledge in each of our fields . The expansion of knowledge will necessitate further specialization within disciplines , yet add greater importance to interdisciplinary . applications . K-12 arts education must respond to these same pressures . <p> I will also argue that a static or declining resource base for higher education should widen differences among universities , not reduce them . As our disciplines expand , we run the risk of spreading disciplinary knowledge too thin if we do not better capitalize on the institutional context in which teaching and research takes place . We should alter our curricula , selectively building depth to maximize the unique strengths of our respective institutions . I am not alone in recommending that arts programs at large universities should avoid replicating what can best be undertaken at smaller liberal arts colleges , independent schools of art and design , and conservatories for the performing arts that follow European beaux-arts traditions. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ways to maximize its institutional contexts instead of striving to emulate university models for teaching and learning in the arts . Public Perceptions of Research in Higher Education <p> It is important for us to consider why many people are critical of the research role that faculty members are expected to play in higher education . Most agree that the discovery of new knowledge is absolutely crucial in our complicated and vulnerable world. 4 But the general public is concerned that higher education has become so preoccupied with research that faculty members have little time and energy left to teach . Others believe that much of the new knowledge produced by faculty members is too far removed from reality to be of any social value . Practitioners in some disciplines , including K-12 teachers , express concern or even contempt for research in higher education because they construe it as esoteric and/or frivolous . And , as we further specialize to cope with the growing volume of new knowledge in our respective disciplines , the public 's perception that our research is absurdly narrow and arcane intensifies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always attracted by creative research , even from those persons whom we think of as reasonably intelligent . For instance , you may recall the segment on 60 Minutes in which Morley Safer harshly attacked contemporary art . That story was the subject of a later article in People Weekly , a PBS special , and an episode of Murphy Brown . As recounted in People Weekly : <p> Safer , 62 , his gravelly voice rumbling with contempt , proceeded to savage such high-priced contemporary artists as Cy Twombly ( one of whose $2 million paintings Safer described as " a canvas of scrawls done with the wrong end of a paintbrush " ) , Jeff Koons ( who recently was paid $150,000 for three basketballs submerged in a fish tank -- " giving new meaning to " slam dunk , " said Safer ) and Robert Gobler , whose displayed creations included a row of three porcelain urinals . All these works , said Safer , flushed with indignation , " belong in the trash heap of art history , " and anyone who buys them is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viewer response to this 60 Minutes segment . Over 500 letters were received ( more than any previous story by the reporter ) , and the vast majority of those letters supported Safer 's critical point of view . Unfortunately , such criticism has not been limited to the visual arts nor to contemporary art-works alone . <p> So why dwell on this criticism when it might otherwise be dismissed as uninformed perception ? It demands our attention , I believe , because it is mostly uninformed . As educators , we are in the business of informing perceptions . Our mission should be to help others understand the value of our research activities . Toward that end , we should assess why even those persons who interact within our immediate sphere -- our students ( many of whom go on to become K-12 teachers ) -- all too often fail to understand our role as researchers . Common Misconceptions about Knowledge Acquisition <p> Faculty research may be largely undervalued because we have not done a good job in helping people understand what our research entails . Traditional teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of new knowledge . Few people get a close-up view of research as such -- the perspective needed to truly understand how knowledge in a discipline evolves through research inquiry . <p> Think about it in the context of the nation 's K-12 educational system , which tends to represent disciplinary knowledge as " baskets of facts . " 6 Schools also perpetuate the misconception that knowledge is what you find in books -- nothing else really counts. 7 Generally speaking , K-12 students rarely ask , nor do their teachers explain , how knowledge is created or in what ways it can take form . <p> In his 1993 presidential address to the American Educational Research Association , Elliot Eisner cited Marcy Singer 's 1991 study of how high school students perceive historical knowledge . Singer found that " students had a difficult time regarding anything other than text as a source of knowledge about the past . They regarded the textbook as sacrosanct " -- the prevalent misconception that if something is written in a book , it must be true. 8 These perceptions were not altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide array of source materials , including the following : <p> Charlie Chaplin 's film , Modern Times ; the film , Rebel without a Cause ; the music of Scott Joplin ; the songs of Pete Seeger ; the music of the Beatles ; the Autobiography of Malcolm X ; Juan Williams 's television program , Eyes on the Prize ; John Steinbeck 's book , Grapes of Wrath ; Ben Shahn 's painting , The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti ; television 's Leave it to Beaver ; the music of Chuck Berry ; paintings by Jackson Pollack . <p> Singer observed that although these historical examples were not thought of as knowledge , their ambiguous nature made for the best classroom discussions . Eisner notes : <p> In restrospect , this is not surprising . After all , what is there to discuss when students confront the certainties of the text ? When it comes to forms of representation that invite interpretation , interpretation followed. 9 <p> As Singer 's study suggests , students who are pursuing higher education , including students in the arts and design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means to interpret and create new knowledge . Although their professors engage in these activities , even advanced students in many fields rarely get a close-up view of faculty research . Very few students have opportunities to see firsthand either how new ideas are cultivated in a discipline or how ideas are crossfertilized through exchanges with other disciplines . Keeping Up with the Expansion of Disciplinary Knowledge <p> One reason why we need to rethink the relationship between teaching and research is because existing curriculum standards do not provide the means to keep pace with the rate at which current knowledge is expanding . Ever since World War II , when universities broadened their focus on teaching to become major research centers , faculty members have played a leading role in the production of new intellectual products . The explosion of new knowledge has been almost unimaginable . Just consider the following statistics : It has been estimated that more new information has been produced in the last thirty years than in the previous 5,000 years. 10 A typical weekday edition of the New York Times contains more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an entire lifetime. 11 In 1989 , it was estimated that 7,000 books were published each day across the globe ; compare that to the mid-fourteenth century when 1,300 volumes made up the entire collection of the largest library in Europe , the Sorbonne Library in Paris. 12 In fiscal year 1992 , 108 major American and Canadian universities reported that their library holdings were over 330 million volumes and 3 million serials , and that they were accumulating additional holdings at the rate of over 9 million volumes per year. 13 <p> The production of new knowledge in the arts is partly reflected in these statistics , but much of what we create does not take form in print . According to the National Endowment for the Arts , no national records are kept on the volume of new works produced each year in the visual and performing arts . Other sources , however , report that production within many U.S. arts and design fields is growing rapidly . For instance , the U.S. film , music , and video industries have been so prolific that some European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly those productions that , by our own standards , have little artistic merit or social value. 14 <p> Also consider that technologies emerging today will give us the ability to create knowledge as never before. 15 It is estimated that the amount of available information now doubles every four or five years , and , by the turn of the century , the doubling time will be every twenty months. 16 This phenomenon has already made a significant impact on creative research . <p> The artist in the last quarter of the century has been faced with a series of problematic choices . Because experiment in the arts has been so wide-ranging and because modern technology makes so much experience immediately available as a subject or example , the artist 's range of options has never been greater . At the same time such range can be seen as fragmenting and arbitrary , dictated not by the pressures of coherent society so much as by a plethora of information. 17 <p> Consequently , some faculty members are doing their very best to restrict the flow of new information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all . That resistance is not altogether unwarranted because , as humorist Dave Barry observes , much of that information and those ideas are not worth having access to . Looking back to the future , Barry quips in a recent Newsweek article that : <p> By the mid-90 's , just about everybody was hooked up to the vast international computer network , exchanging vast quantities of information at high speeds via modems and fiber-optic cable with everyone else . The problem , of course , was that even though the information was coming a lot faster , the vast majority of it , having originated with human beings , was still wrong . Eventually people realized that the Information Highway was essentially CB radio , but with more typing. 18 <p> In all seriousness , we face an enormous challenge in deciding how to help students grasp the big picture of our disciplines while leading them to develop in-depth knowledge in an area of specialization that will serve them well beyond graduation . Making choices about the depth and breadth of a curriculum is an age-old problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from . Never before has the big picture been so big . As arts education policymakers , we will need to pay more attention to this problem and look for ways to adapt or reinvent the infrastructure upon which our existing curriculum rests . It is equally important that universities build curricular infrastructures that will undergird curricular reform in K-12 arts education . The Disciplinary Structure of Teaching and Research in Higher Education <p> Historically , higher education has given structure to knowledge dissemination by organizing the curriculum around academic disciplines . The disciplinary curricular structure of U.S. universities took hold between 1870 and 1900 , when <p> the number of college faculty grew nearly fivefold , from 5,553 to 23,863 . The number increased not primarily to keep pace with student enrollment ( 113,131graduates in 1870 ; 226,530 in 1900 ) , but to accommodate the growth in academic research and outreach services. 19 <p> The production of new disciplinary knowledge is now integral to the curricular infrastructure of modern universities . The actual process of creating new knowledge , however , has been principally reserved for faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terminal master 's degree programs , students are typically seen as the receivers of new knowledge , not as creators . Students may engage in exercises and experiments to rediscover existing disciplinary knowledge or to practice problem solving and decision making in the discipline , but these learning activities are typically not regarded as research that yields new knowledge . <p> Generally speaking , higher education does not enable its students to understand how knowledge is actually created . This is even often true in teacher education programs . Consider students ' typical introduction to disciplinary knowledge through survey courses . Despite the best of intentions , many survey courses merely provide <p> a groundwork of facts and principles , leaving out connections to the people who have advanced the field and delaying the introduction of the wonder of discovery to the more advanced levels of instruction. 20 <p> As the body of knowledge in a discipline grows , survey courses become increasingly less useful . We should question whether this historical curriculum model will soon become obsolete . Are we asking the faculty members who teach survey courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty members identify disciplinary knowledge that should be omitted from the curriculum ? Providing answers to the latter question is especially relevant for those who seek to build more substantial bridges between universities and K-12 schools . The Nature of Advanced Learning <p> We also need to reexamine our expectations about student learning . While some educators believe students can be best served by knowing a little about a lot of things as long as they also possess critical thinking skills , research on learning does not support this argument . What seems certain is that the acquisition of expertise is discipline specific. 21 For example , an expert in nuclear physics will function as a relative novice in solving problems in political science or in understanding the historical significance of contributions by Martha Graham to dance , Mies van der Rohe to architecture , Arnold Schoenberg to music , Arthur Miller to theatre , and Georgia O'Keeffe to the visual arts . <p> Research on novice/expert differences also shows that experts use effective knowledge-seeking strategies and advanced thinking skills because they have acquired a sizable body of in-depth disciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " learning how to learn . " 23 <p> One continually encounters the pronouncement that students ' heads should not be filled with information but that instead students should be taught how to find the information they need . This is one of the silliest of persisting ideas in education . A related but more plausible educational belief is that students should not be taught isolated facts ; rather , they should be taught central concepts that render facts meaningful . Research . . . has shown , however , that the ability to grasp and retain new information , to link it meaningfully to central ideas , depends greatly on the extent of one 's existing knowledge . People with little knowledge in a domain are almost compelled to deal with knowledge as isolated fragments , only vaguely relatable to higher level principles. 24 <p> The problem we must address is that novices in any field tend to develop " shallow " knowledge structures . They acquire " a few general ideas and a lot of details connected to the general ideas but not to each other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , or a specialized vocabulary without understanding the conditions of how and where that knowledge applies and can be used most effectively . " 26 <p> As experts , faculty members possess " deep or multilevel knowledge structures , with many connections between and within levels . " 27 This equips them to use their knowledge in various contexts , while novices often find it difficult to transfer their existing knowledge at appropriate times . When a student 's prior knowledge becomes inert , it is rendered essentially useless . Didactic teaching methods , compartmentalized curricula , and rote-learning strategies encourage the acquisition of inert knowledge , which , in turn , stifles the development of learning in a discipline . <p> The educational implications of these findings are worth policy-makers ' serious consideration . It is increasingly evident that we should work towards setting curriculum standards to disseminate knowledge that students will be able to use later -- not in the restrictive sense of vocational application alone , but for the broader purpose of enhancing thinking and expertise . This means disseminating as much knowledge to students as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise find meaningful . <p> As the body of disciplinary knowledge expands , we will face even harder choices in selecting what to teach , let alone how to ensure that content is meaningfully disseminated to students . If the solution to this problem is to narrow the curriculum by creating more subdisciplines and areas of specializations , we must be aware that organizing curricula in this way can reduce our students ' ability to grasp important connections within and beyond arts disciplines . One way to help students see past discipline boundaries is to align curriculum standards and teaching practices to correspond more closely with the ways research inquiry is pursued in our disciplines . The Influence of Other Disciplines on Research in the Arts and Design <p> It is not uncommon for artists and scholars to draw upon ideas from other disciplines in their personal research . The attraction of interdisciplinary collaboration is that we can continue to pursue depth within an area of specialization , yet draw upon expertise in related disciplines when the need arises . This allows us to gain valuable input from other fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own discipline . <p> Some researchers in the arts search for innovation by working back and forth between two or more disciplines . Crossdisciplinary research has a strong history in the arts -- some of the best known examples date back to the Italian Renaissance and earlier . For instance , Michelangelo 's work crossed painting , sculpture , and architecture , and Leonardo da Vinci worked simultaneously as a painter , astronomer , architect , and engineer , among other things . <p> Contemporary researchers in the arts have had more difficulty in working between disciplines . For example , on my own campus , Charles Csuri confronted many obstacles when he sought to explore computer applications for art making during the 1960s . Although computer scientists supported Csuri 's interdisciplinary exploration of ideas , the same was not true of faculty in his home department . The vision of artists , designers , and scientists working within the same environment has now been realized on our campus under the umbrella of the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design ( ACCAD ) . Reaching that goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Today , ACCAD is among the most successful computer visualization and animation programs in the nation , and it has a prominent international standing . Graduate students who study at ACCAD work with faculty and staff to produce creative works that simply could not be undertaken without close association with the computer science community on our campus . Furthermore , students benefit because under its current director , Wayne Carlson , ACCAD attracts professional staff from the Ohio Supercomputer Center as well as researchers and students from many fields , including : <p> aeronautical engineering , architecture , studio art , art education , art history , city and regional planning , cognitive science , computer and information science , dance , design , industrial systems engineering , geodetic sciences , instructional design and technology , medicine , music , speech and hearing , and theatre . <p> Other contemporary researchers have also been discouraged from engaging in more than one arts or design discipline . A case was cited recently by Maya Lin in an interview about the installation of a new sculptural work she created for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When asked to explain why , as the well-known architect of the Vietnam War Memorial , she also made sculpture , Maya Lin replied : <p> Ten years ago , people who were trying to do more than one thing were met with a lot of suspicion , but that 's changed . Somehow it seems very human to do several things that have to do with one another . I love architecture and I love sculpture , and I could never choose . Sculpture to me is poetry ; and architecture , is like creating a novel. 28 <p> These examples suggest that we need to provide more support for the exploration of ideas beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries . In the past , we have resisted supporting this exploration , sometimes inadvertently and sometimes quite deliberately . That resistance is gradually lessening as many programs in the arts at universities strive to become increasingly interdisciplinary . The same progression towards interdisciplinary inquiry can be found in some K-12 arts programs , but overall that progress has been constrained by the dominant disciplinary structure in which arts teachers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arts and Design Curricula <p> If our goal is that students should meaningfully connect information within and between disciplines , we need to question the tradition of organizing curricula in any way that inhibits interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary inquiry . Academic departments in colleges and universities and independent institutions of higher education are structured to preserve and perpetuate the disciplines they represent . That effort is desirable because advanced learning and expertise is specialized in nature and because " disciplines do continually turn up better ways of construing reality -- better not because they correspond more closely to reality , but because they enlarge our field of vision , equipping us with tools for doing things " that were previously beyond our imagination. 29 <p> At the same time , rigid allegiance to a discipline or subdiscipline can inhibit the creation and understanding of important knowledge . When students see themselves as members of a narrow area of specialization , we can not be sure that they are prepared to take full advantage of new ideas and relevant knowledge in other fields . <p> The only intelligent way to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crossdisciplinary collaboration . This is not easy when we are simultaneously pressured to respond to the growing volume of disciplinary knowledge in our own fields . The problem is , however , not insurmountable when we consider that university faculty members are proficient at exploring . ideas through their own research , often in directions that move beyond disciplinary boundaries or have the potential to do so . <p> If our goal is to prepare the next generation of innovators in our respective disciplines and future teachers who will lead others to understand those innovations , we will need to develop new strategies and technologies for helping our students organize , evaluate , and cross link knowledge of the past to emerging ideas of the present. 30 That might be best accomplished if we took full advantage of the fact that as faculty members in institutions of higher education , we are the ones who help advance disciplinary knowledge . As researchers , we can and should lead our students to discover how and why new ideas emerge in the field by engaging in research that is closely linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research-based or inquiry-based models of teaching is that they can place as much emphasis on researching what is already known in the discipline as they do on discovering what is yet unknown . As experienced researchers , college or university faculty members can function as the source of current knowledge in the discipline and as leaders in directing the search for new ideas . Instead of viewing the curriculum as a " fixed agenda , " we might think of it as a matrix or map or network of big ideas . <p> Working from such a matrix or map provides us with an overall sense as opposed to a linear sense of direction , where one topic follows another . The teacher 's task , given the matrix or network view of curriculum , extends beyond that of a manager or orchestrator who ensures that things unfold as planned . Rather than remain above the fray , teachers work alongside students , serving as a kind of " cross-country guide " as they explore the territory mapped out by the network of big ideas. 31 <p> Approaching teaching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it would require structuring the curriculum somewhat differently. 32 Learning Through Collaborative Research <p> To some faculty members in the arts and design , the thought of merging teaching with research may seem overly restrictive -- perhaps limiting the personal exploration and expression of ideas that are so important to creative disciplines . However , as artists and scholars who teach , we should welcome the opportunity to distinguish our work from that produced by independent artists and scholars who can not as readily capitalize on what students can bring to the creation of new knowledge . <p> There are countless examples of students in the arts who have played important roles in contributing to creative and scholarly thinking . This is particularly true in performance disciplines , such as contemporary dance , because performance is almost always a collaborative activity . My colleague , Vickie Blaine , who chairs the Department of Dance at Ohio State University , tells me that her work in solving compositional problems has been greatly influenced by students over the years . Blaine looks at her students as individuals with unique perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nurturing . She fosters an atmosphere of learning in which her students draw ideas from one another , and she expects to learn from her students in the process of teaching . The end result is that a choreographer like Bebe Miller , one of Blaine 's many successful former students , now often uses a collaborative framework for creating new works with the dancers in her own professional company . <p> Another example of collaborative inquiry between professor and student can be found in the history of music education . In the preface to his seminal book , Harmonielehre ( 1911 ) , composer Arnold Schoenberg describes how he worked to blur the line between teaching and research : <p> This book I have learned from my pupils . In my teaching I never sought merely " to tell the pupil what I know . " Better to tell him what he did not know . . . . The teacher must have the courage to admit his own mistakes . He does not have to pose as infallible , as one who knows all and never errs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps sometimes finding . . . . Successful completion of assignments by the pupils established the soundness of my efforts without luring me into the fallacy that I had solved the problem definitively . And I think neither the pupils nor I have fared badly that way . Had I told them merely what I know , then they would have known just that and nothing more . As it is , they know perhaps even less . But they do know what matters : the search itself ! 33 <p> Many other faculty members in the arts commonly use highly interactive and individualized teaching practices . More than most other higher education fields , the arts and design have a tradition of blurring the line between teaching and research . Much of our teaching directly engages students in the act of interpretation , problem solving , decision making , and other active learning experiences . <p> But we are not without our faults . We also lapse into didactic teaching methods on occasion . And sometimes we are so process oriented that we neglect to teach our students much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and for creating new works . Thus , one of our challenges as policymakers is to explore how to better integrate the disciplinary knowledge of the past into curriculum standards that are trying to anticipate the future . That future is likely to place growing importance on the institutional context in which our teaching and research takes place . Acknowledging Different Contexts for Disciplinary Inquiry <p> Clearly , higher education does not currently have the resources to support the full scope of inquiry possible in arts and design disciplines . The forecast for future support is not encouraging . Even the largest comprehensive research universities are discovering that they can not do everything . In the years ahead , all institutions of higher education will have to find greater focus to cope with increasingly expansive disciplines . This poses an even more serious problem for K-12 education . <p> If new knowledge continues to grow as projected , we will need to escalate our search for ways to make the best possible use of limited human and capital resources . It makes most sense to do so by planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique about the context in which that teaching and research occurs -- the particular college or university setting as well as the broader community in which that institution exists . Most institutions already do this to some extent , but we will need to intensify our efforts . This includes challenging the very idea of " the core curriculum . " <p> At present , " the core " is that part of our curriculum that replicates what is taught at other institutions offering the same degree program . That is the very nature of accreditation standards . Some policymakers in higher education argue that a standardized model of core-degree requirements is the best way to preserve and perpetuate disciplinary knowledge . Many other faculty members argue that it is increasingly difficult to find a disciplinary core , while future K-12 teachers leave our teacher education programs thinking that " the core " is absolute -- what is fundamental to understanding an arts discipline is not subject to change . <p> The further expansion of disciplinary knowledge will tempt some educators to enlarge the core curriculum . A negative consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn what can be uniquely gained from the institution they are attending . It might be wiser to replace the idea of a core that replicates other degree programs with a core that gives focus to specializations that reflect the unique strengths of a particular department , college , university , and professional community . Rather than working to create and disseminate knowledge within self-contained programs , we might build articulated networks of complementary programs across many institutions . Such articulation could ensure that disciplinary knowledge is covered in depth and breadth by a network of institutions -- not by each accredited institution in and of itself . New technologies give us the means to make this possible if we want it to happen . <p> I am suggesting that programs offered at large universities should look very different from those offered at small liberal arts colleges , conservatories for the performing arts , and independent schools of art and design . For instance , arts curricula at universities might give particular emphasis to new technologies and to interdisciplinary study , playing up the rich opportunities that exist at universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universities , because they are so diverse in the disciplines they teach and support , provide atypical forums for artistic growth . . . . They provide through their great diversity an unusual opportunity for interdisciplinary study , not only among artists , but between artists and scholars in what may have been mutually exclusive areas of study -- certainly disciplines that would never have been taught in conservatories or schools of beaux-arts. 34 <p> Schools of art and design and conservatories also have resources that are uniquely their own . For instance , many independent schools of art and design are advantaged by the fact that they are colocated with major museum collections , and/or they are closely affiliated with professional arts and design organizations . <p> Similar pressures on " the core curriculum " within K-12 education have led some schools to reduce or eliminate arts education programs . Those in higher education must not forget that their definition of " the core " often sets de facto standards for elementary and secondary schools . Therefore , if universities move toward building curricula around focused disciplinary and interdisciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to help K-12 educators build compatible , though not identical , curricular structures . It seems certain that the current quest for comprehensiveness in all facets of K-12 and higher education curricula will become increasingly less feasible as disciplinary knowledge expands in all fields , including the arts . Conclusion <p> The production of new knowledge is valuable because it broadens our vision , enhances our own understanding , and nurtures innovation , " yet the sheer volume of the data amassed makes almost inevitable the reduction of our focus to what is in the end a very narrow endeavor. " 35 Arts policymakers in higher education must take account of this problem . We must <p> address much more seriously the consequences of the explosion of knowledge , its specialization and fragmentation . It is not enough just to be a contributor to the expansion of knowledge . Unorganized , unrelated , and uninterpreted knowledge becomes inaccessible . It loses its potential and erodes commitment to the value of knowledge. 36 <p> As arts disciplines expand , it becomes increasingly important that we prepare our students to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining questions generated by themselves and others , and to understand how those questions relate to existing disciplinary knowledge . We must take steps to revisit current educational practices . To start , we should acknowledge that " schooling , with its continual emphasis on the answering of questions as the immediate goal of learning , may be defeating the development of expertise in all but the most hardy students . " 37 Policymakers should find ways to support the acquisition of knowledge and skills through interactive , research-based inquiry . We need to remind ourselves that elementary and secondary teachers will not approach teaching the arts as disciplinary and interdisciplinary inquiry if they , themselves , do not fully understand the arts as forms of thinking and knowing . Likewise , we can not expect K-12 arts teachers to teach through research-based inquiry if those opportunities were absent from their own learning experiences . By learning how their professors draw upon expertise in related fields , our students can build a strong foundation for extending and applying disciplinary knowledge long after graduation . <p> Reaching that goal will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of learning . The very idea that the acquisition of knowledge is an interpretive act is foreign to many students , including those pursuing university degrees . John McPherson vividly captures this problem in one of his cartoon series , Close to Home . He pictures a student , named Wayne Merlman , who is hard at work studying a book on the history of the Magna Carta . The cartoon caption states , " Unable to find a Hi-Liter , Wayne Merlman used a black Magic Marker to cross out all the stuff he did n't want to read again . " We see from the cartoon illustration that the only thing Wayne thinks worth remembering is that " The Magna Carta was signed in 1215. " 38 Unfortunately , many students in higher education , like Wayne , think that learning requires rote memorization of factual information or the mindless acquisition of technical skills . Some of these students are studying the arts , and a subset of these students will one day become elementary and secondary arts teachers . <p> We should look at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves to traditional routes . <p> The amazing developments in information technology offer quite wonderful avenues for our inventiveness . Perhaps their most important contribution is their reframing of the dimensions of possibility. 39 <p> For instance , when it is impractical for students to engage in research-based inquiry with faculty because of the lack of space , equipment , materials , and time , we now have the means to use or invent new interactive technologies to simulate a research learning environment -- one that comes close to erasing the line between research and teaching . <p> The curricular divisions , core degree requirements , and institutional independence , which have served us so well historically , will need to be revisited to face the demands of teaching increasingly vast bodies of disciplinary knowledge . With greater production of knowledge in the future comes a greater responsibility for us to teach the significance of that knowledge , or the lack thereof . It seems inevitable that we should look to other institutions to share that responsibility , rather than attempting to go it alone . <p> <p>

@@4088441 Street-level and rooftop ( three-story building ) concentrations of particulate matter ? 2.5 m in diameter ( PMsub2.5 ) were measured in downtown Trujillo , Peru , in July and August 2003 to determine the PMsub2.5 concentration reduction on days with normal traffic conditions ( 32 days ) versus a day when motor vehicles were temporarily banned from the downtown district ( 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. , July 15 ) known as El Dia Sin Autos ( " The Day Without Cars " ) . The mean 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. street-level PMsub2.5 concentration during the motor vehicle ban ( 21.4 ug/m ; one day ) was 49% lower than when vehicles were not impeded ( 42.2 7.8 g/m - mean 1 standard deviation ; 20 days ) . The rooftop monitoring station indicated a 20% decrease in PMsub2.5 concentrations ( 24.82.6 g/m vs. 19.9 6.0 g/m ) when motor vehicles were not present within historic downtown Trujillo . Temperature , relative humidity , and wind speed during the motor vehicle ban and during normal traffic were not significantly different ( p &gt; .05 ) . </p> Introduction The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor air pollution above the maximum recommended limits ( World Health Organization WHO , 1999 ) . Air pollution , a variety of particles and gases produced either directly or indirectly from fossil fuel combustion , is a major environmental health problem present within an array of urban and rural settings in both developed and developing nations . Although industrial , commercial , agricultural , and residential sectors have been identified as contributors of ambient air pollution in developing countries ( Reinhardt , Ottmar , &; Castilla , 2001 ; Shendall &; Naeher , 2002 ; Smith , 1993 ; Xianglu et al. , 2005 ; Xianglu &; Naeher , 2006 ) , multiple studies have shown that the transportation sector is a major if not the primary source of certain air pollutants within urban areas , particularly within Latin American cities ( Instituto Nacional de Estadstica Geogragica , &; Lopez-Salinas , 2005 ) . Multiple emission inventories have suggested that motor vehicles are the principal contributor of fine particulate matter or PMsub25 ( particles with an aerodynamic diameter ? 2.5 m ) to the atmosphere in urban areas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Transport , 2002 ; Economopoulou &; Economopoulous , 2002 ; Schauer et al , 1996 ) , which is positively correlated with morbidity and mortality , particularly among people with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases ( Dockery et al. , 1993 ; Health Effects Institute , 2001 ; WHO , 2000 ) . Increased health risks are associated with decreasing distances to traffic motorways ( Brunekreef et al. , 1997 ; Van Vliet et al. , 1997 ) , and particulates generated from combustion processes , especially diesel exhaust particulates , are more toxic and often result in more exacerbated health effects than those from noncombustion processes ( Bernstein et al. , 2004 ; Brunekreef et al. , 1997 ; Van Vliet et al , 1997 ) . Furthermore , studies have also shown improved respiratory health in children when ambient air pollution levels decline ( Bayer-Oglesby et al. , 2005 ) . </p> While many air pollution source-identification studies derive their results from either particulate matter speciation or modeling to determine the amount attributable to motor vehicles , current research shows a data gap in natural experiments measuring air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from the urban environment . The objective of our study was to measure street-level and rooftop-level PMsub2.5 concentrations in historic downtown Trujillo , Peru , in order to determine the difference in PMsub2.5 corresponding to a period where motor vehicles were temporarily banned from the historic downtown area and also during normal traffic conditions . The temporary ban on all types of motor vehicles within historic downtown Trujillo known as El Dia Sin Autos or " The Day Without Cars " was an attempt by the local municipal government to expose the general population to a motor vehicle exhaust-free zone and to promote a decreased reliance on motor vehicles in the hopes of gaining support for the local government 's clean air agenda . </p> Methods Study Location Trujillo , Peru , is an arid , coastal city of 732,000 people located just west of the foothills of the Andes Mountains . Trujillo 's historic downtown is located in the center of downtown Trujillo and encompasses all of the area inside Avenida Espaa , an oval-shaped road 1,350 m long and 850 m wide . Historic downtown Trujillo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nacional de Trujillo , 2003 ) regularly resulting in pedestrian and motor vehicle congestion during the local rush hours ( 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. ; 7:00 p.m. to 9 p.m . ) . An established local ordinance prohibits the entry of any bus or public transportation van ( primarily diesel-fueled ) within the Avenida Espaa perimeter resulting in a downtown primarily populated by taxis . Over 6,900 taxis ( mean age =11 years ) were registered within Trujillo in 2003 , 62% of which use gasoline and 38% of which use diesel fuel ( Trujillo City Hall , 2003 ) . In 2000 most of Trujillo 's registered motor vehicle fleet of 53,614 units were not equipped with any emission control system and the average public transportation vehicle age was 19 years old ( Trujillo City Hall , 2003 ; Trujillo Public Transportation Union , 2003 ) . </p> Air Monitoring Locations On July 15 , 2003 , from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. , no motor vehicles were allowed in the Avenida Espaa perimeter surrounding historic downtown Trujillo for the inaugural El Dia Sin Autos ( " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected as the central monitoring location due to its location within historic downtown Trujillo and its security . Trujillo City Hall is located as close as 430 m to Avenida Espaa to the south and far as 850 m away to the northeast . A real-time PMsub2.5 aerosol monitor was positioned at street level outside of a City Hall window 2 m from the closest traffic lane starting on " The Day Without Cars " ( July 15 , 2003 ) and it continued monitoring for the subsequent 20 days when traffic flow was not banned . Two monitoring stations containing both real-time and gravimetric PMsub25 instruments were previously established on July 3 and continuously ran until August 4 capturing days of unimpeded traffic before and after " The Day Without Cars . " One station was located on the roof of the three-story City Hall building directly above the street-level monitor . The second station was located in a rural area 9 km west of downtown at the Trujillo airport ( Cassidy Naeher , Villalobos , Ryan , &; Bayer , 2004 ) . The airport monitoring station was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the source of meteorological data utilized in our study . Hourly weather data was collected daily by airport employees from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m . </p> Pollutants Measured and Equipment Description Real-time PMsub25 levels were measured using DustTrak aerosol monitors . At the end of the sampling period all of the aerosol monitors utilized in the study were run in parallel for 12 hours atop Trujillo City Hall to establish a concentration coefficient to adjust for inter-instrumentation variation . Previous studies have shown that DustTrak aerosol monitors ' concentration readings differ depending on the type of PM being sampled ( Macintosh , Williams , &; Yanosky 2002 ; Volckens , Boundy Leith , &; Hands , 1999 ) . Assuming that gravimetric PMsub25 measurements are more representative to the actual PMsub25 concentration , the real-time PMsub25 concentrations were adjusted according to 24-hour average gravimetric concentrations measured beside the DustTrak atop City Hall from July 3 to August 4 to increase comparability between the two sampling methods . </p> Twenty-four-hour time-integrated PMsub25 samples were collected using 37 mm Teflon filters , KTL PMsub25 cyclones , and SKC universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below 0C during storage and shipment . Filters were allowed to equilibrate for a 48 hour period at 20.61.4C , 56.19% relative humidity in a filter chamber prior to the weighing of the filters . Each filter was weighed at least twice before and twice after sampling using a Cahn C-35 microbalance to ensure the measured weights were within 5 g . All measurements were performed as outlined in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's ( U.S. EPA 's ) Quality Assurance Guidance Document ( U.S. Environmental Protection Agency U.S. EPA , 1998 ) . Air densities during weighing sessions , nominal densities of calibration masses , and control filters were used to adjust the balance readings for the buoyancy effect of air ( Koistinen , Kousa , Virpi , Hanninen , &; Jantunen , 1999 ) . </p> Results The mean 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. street-level PMsub25 concentrations with and without motor vehicles present were , respectively , 42.2 7.8 g/m ( mean 1 standard deviation , n = 20 days ) and 21.4 g/m ( n = 1 day ) . Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test indicated a normal distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present ( p = .0201 ) . T-tests measuring the difference of means between the samples with and without cars were not possible due to the single sample collected without motor vehicles . Knowing that the 20 samples with motor vehicles present were normally distributed , however , one could use the empirical rule to estimate the sample distribution . The 21.4 g/m mean concentration without motor vehicles was 2.83 standard deviations from the mean PMsub25 concentration with motor vehicles ( 42.2 7.8 g/m ) . According to the empirical rule , 2.83 standard deviations from the mean PMsub25 concentration with motor vehicles present would include 99.5% of all samples in a normally distributed sample . Although unable to statistically test a difference of means due to the low sample size , this distribution indicates a potentially strong PMsub25 concentration difference among the samples with and without motor vehicles . </p> Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the real-time PMsub2.5 concentrations at street level and atop the City Hall roof , respectively , during the samples with and without motor vehicles . When motor vehicles were not present between 8:00 a.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 49% lower ( 21.4 g/m vs. 42.2 7.8 g/m ) and were 18% lower at the rooftop ( 19.9 g/m vs. 24.4 1.9 g/m ) . </p> The difference between the 24-hour mean street-level and rooftop-level PMsub25 concentrations during the motor vehicle ban was less than 2 g/m . The 24-hour mean PMsub25 concentrations were 47% higher at street level ( 44.0 6.6 g/m ) than on the rooftop ( 29.8 2.7 g/m ) , however , throughout the 20 day sampling period . Both street-level and rooftop PMsub25 concentrations followed a diurnal pattern where PMsub25 concentrations were lowest during the afternoon ( average high temperature of 21C ) when most pollution sources were active and were consistently higher during the night ( average low temperature of 14C ) when pollution sources were more scarce . This trend suggests a potential nocturnal inversion effect . </p> The mean 24-hour gravimetric PMsub25 concentrations measured on the roof of City Hall throughout the entire sampling period had an average of 36.19.2 g/m ( n = 32 days ) while the mean 24-hour period containing " The Day Without Cars " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned for only 10 of the 24 hours of sampling , however , therefore weakening this comparison . </p> Discussion Since sunlight is a driving force in the creation of ocean breezes , daytime temperatures were highly correlated with wind speed ( r = .978 ; p = .000 ) . Since both temperature and wind increase atmospheric mixing and pollution dilution in either a horizontal or vertical direction PMsub25 concentrations were inversely related to both wind speed ( r = -.837 ; p = .000 ) and temperature ( r = -.763 ; p = .001 ) . This indicates that the particle dilution rate increased as the ocean breezes and temperatures became more intense during the afternoon and decreased as the wind speeds and temperature declined at night , resulting in less atmospheric mixing and increased pollution concentrations . The high correlation between temperature and wind speed may result in a confounding effect , however , in which the significant association between PMsub25 concentrations and weather phenomena may not be as attributable as stated . </p> In order to determine if the decrease in PMsub25 concentrations on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather phenomenon , meteorological data collected at the airport and downtown monitoring stations were analyzed to determine if a significant change occurred in the weather during the " Day Without Cars " compared to the remainder of the sampling period . The meteorological data collected at the downtown monitoring station ( temperature ) and 9 km away at the airport ( temperature , barometric pressure , and wind speed ) did not significantly differ among the two data sets . </p> The " Day Without Cars " natural experiment presented multiple variables for which we could not prepare or control due to time and personnel constraints . First , the motor vehicle densities on and outside of Avenida Espaa were not recorded during the " Day Without Cars . " Therefore , it is not possible to determine if the nearby motor vehicle density outside of historic downtown Trujillo was similar on days with and without the motor vehicle ban . The traffic ban within historic downtown Trujillo may have potentially increased the motor vehicle density on and just outside Avenida Espaa due to rerouted traffic resulting in a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , we were unaware of " The Day Without Cars " until just prior to the event . Therefore , ground-level PMsub25 data was not collected prior to " The Day Without Cars . " The use of concentrations prior to and after July 15 would have been useful in determining if an increasing or decreasing trend occurred in pollution concentrations over time . The measurements on top of the City Hall building , however , which included 12 days before and 20 days after " The Day Without Cars , " indicated that the pollution concentrations were relatively constant . Finally , the main limitation of this study was the short period without motor vehicles present , limiting the amount of data that could be collected in the 10-hour motor vehicle ban . </p> Conclusion Since multiple variables could not be controlled in the analysis , it is impossible to state with absolute confidence the percent difference in PMsub2.5 concentration due to the absence of motor vehicles within historic downtown Trujillo . The data do suggest that the removal of motor vehicles from historic downtown Trujillo results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of PMsub25 concentration at roof level . The greater reduction in PMsub25 concentrations at street-level opposed to that on the City Hall rooftop is potentially due to the proximity of the equipment to motor vehicles as well as the fact that a larger portion of the rooftop 's pollutants derive from sources outside of Avenida Espaa , which were less affected by the motor vehicle ban . The decreased PMsub25 concentrations measured when motor vehicles were banned from historic downtown Trujillo suggests that motor vehicles are a major source of particulate pollution within the area . The Trujillo local government has been informed of the study results , and Trujillo has observed a " Day Without Cars " in the historic downtown area every year since 2003 . </p> Acknowlegements : This study was funded in part by the International Society for Exposure Analysis/American Chemistry Council Early Career Award ; UGA , Biomedical Health Sciences Institute and Office of International Agriculture ; Asociacion del Aire Ambiental , Lima , Peru ; Trujillo City Hall .

@@4018641 The largest body of brackish water in the world , the Baltic Sea , has severe problems of water pollution and environmental degradation. 1 As late as 1950 , the Baltic Sea was still regarded as environmentally " healthy . " Since that time , however , the situation has changed dramatically . In spite of numerous protective efforts , the Baltic Sea 's rich biodiversity is threatened by environmental pollution that could cause irreversible damage to a sea that is an important source of economic activity and recreation for more than 80 million people who live along its coast and within its catchment area . <p> The Baltic Sea catchment area , or drainage basin , is home to 14 nations ( see Figure 1 on page 9 ) . Nine of them share the Baltic 's coastline : Sweden and Finland to the north ; Russia , Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania to the east ; Poland to the south ; and Germany and Denmark to the west . The catchment area also includes parts of Belarus , Norway , Ukraine , the Slovak Republic , and the Czech Republic because some of the rivers flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these countries are undergoing dramatic political , economic , and social changes . As the division of Europe into Western and Eastern blocs vanishes and the countries in the eastern and southern Baltic region lose their peripheral position , the region has chance of regaining its historical position as one of the major crossroads of economic exchange , as in the time of the Hanseatic League -- a mercantile organization of towns along the Baltic Sea and the North Sea from the 13th through 18th centuries that allowed trade to flow across the Baltic Sea without political obstacles . Certainly , such present cooperation as the recent establishment of the Union of the Baltic Cities and the Baltic Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs confirms this possibility ( see the box on pages 12 and 13 ) . <p> The Baltic Sea is important in several ways . Its coast is a popular vacation area ; therefore , the demand for tourist and recreation services is very high . The coastal areas also serve as spawning , nursery , and feeding grounds for several species of marine and freshwater fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cod dominate in open waters , and both marine and freshwater species inhabit coastal areas . The value of the catches , which amounts today to about 540 million European currency units ( ECU ) per year , is an indication of the considerable economic importance of the Baltic fishery . But above all , the Baltic Sea has an environmental significance of its own : It is a shared heritage to be preserved and managed as a common resource . Causes of Degradation <p> The Baltic Sea has a total surface area of 415 square kilometers and is naturally vulnerable to pollution because of its semi-closed character and particular hydrography . The link with the North Sea is very narrow , with the shallowest sill being only 18 meters d B link , the Baltic Sea is dominated by freshwater inputs . Vertical variations in salinity cause permanent stratification , hampering the exchange of oxygen in the deeper parts of the sea . In some years , as much as 100,000 square kilometers , close to one-fourth of the whole sea , approaches " dead bottom " conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously aggravated by the destruction of its wetlands , particularly in the western parts of the catchment area . During the 19th century , coastal wetlands were ditched and drained to meet the demands of expanding agriculture . Wetlands have also been dredged or filled to make room for urban and industrial developments , including harbors . The consequences of these activities were not readily visible until the environmental situation in the Baltic Sea had further deteriorated . <p> Pollution reaches the Baltic Sea by a wide diversity of pathways . Diffuse " nonpoint " sources include airborne emissions and agricultural runoff , while point-source pollution from urban areas and industry -- including untreated sewage from 30 million people , wastewater from pulp-and-paper and other industries , toxic substances , and heavy metals -- is either directly discharged into the sea or carried into it by rivers . This devastating influx can be attributed to a host of different factors , including economic inefficiency , poor legislation , lack of enforcement , and institutional weaknesses . In general , however , Denmark , Finland , Norway , Sweden , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problems than do the once centrally planned economies . In the former , municipal and industrial pollution loads have been significantly reduced over the last few decades , and product control measures have reduced the use of hazardous compounds . There is , however , still scope for improved control in some industries , such as pulp-and-paper . The total farming area in these countries is much smaller than in other parts of the basin , but intensive agricultural practices involve high use of chemicals , and better policies are needed to control nutrient releases . <p> In the countries that used to have centrally planned economies , pollution loads from various sources are still heavy although declining somewhat because of new control measures and the overall slowdown of economic activities in the past few years . In the past , the economic structure of these countries became skewed toward heavy industry dominated by large , state-owned monopolies . These industries used as much as two to three times more water and energy per unit of output than did similar industries in other countries of the basin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such large industrial basins as Upper Silesia in Poland and Ostrava in the Czech Republic ) , coupled with inadequate wastewater treatment and limited emission control , resulted in very high levels of water and air pollution as well as large quantities of solid wastes . <p> The principal pollution sources for the Baltic Sea are municipalities , industries , and agriculture that are located not only on the coast but deep in the interior as well . Municipalities <p> In the formerly centrally planned economies , most of the water bodies , such as rivers , natural and man-made lakes , and groundwater aquifers , receive excessive amounts of untreated or insufficiently treated municipal wastewater . Existing facilities , including sewer systems and treatment plants , are generally inadequate , overloaded , and poorly maintained and operated . Moreover , large quantities of highly toxic industrial wastewater and chemical liquid wastes are discharged into the municipal sewage systems . For example , in the late 1980s , the city of St. Petersburg was responsible for about 90 percent of all copper and chromium discharged into the Gulf of Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment processes to operate efficiently . Without either pretreatment or the separation of noxious industrial wastes from household sewage , serious problems with sludge disposal also arise . Another important source of water pollution , and one which is attracting increasing attention , is storm water runoff from urban areas . <p> In the Nordic countries and in the western states of Germany , there have been substantial reductions in the pollution load discharged by municipalities during the last 20 years . The load of organic substances has been reduced from 50 to 5 percent and that of phosphorous from 25 to 10 percent of the amount generated by municipalities . For example , in Sweden and Finland , the average reduction efficiency for biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD ) and phosphorus in municipal sewage treatment plants exceeds 90 percent . Industries <p> Industrial restructuring is taking place in the formerly centrally planned economies , but it will take many years for the environmental effects of this process to become more visible . For the time being , industry continues to play a significant role in the discharge of polluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chemical industries discharge a variety of inorganic wastes that affect water in diverse ways , including rendering it completely toxic . Synthetic chemical production creates new and more exotic types of waste . Many technologies are obsolete , the most dramatic examples being the paper mills in Kaliningrad , Russia , that were built at the end of the 19th century . Wastewater treatment installations typically suffer from the same problems as sewage treatment plants -- insufficiency , overloading , and poor operation and maintenance . <p> The pulp-and-paper industry , in particular , plays a significant role in the discharge of oxygen-consuming , nutrient-rich , and slowly degradable substances into the sea and river waters in the Baltic region . Most of the old mills are located in the Karelian , St. Petersburg , and Kaliningrad regions of Russia , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , and Poland . In Sweden and Finland , pulp-and-paper mills are located primarily in the catchments of the Bothnian Sea , Bothnian Bay , and the Gulf of Finland . Some of the mills already have closed circulation of process water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further substitutes for chlorine- and sulfur-containing chemicals . <p> In the Baltic 's catchment area , about 400 million tons of solid waste of industrial and municipal origin are generated annually . In Denmark , Finland , Sweden , and the western states of Germany , hazardous wastes are handled separately from both household and regular industrial waste and are properly treated . Unfortunately , this is not the case in the remaining countries of the region , where thousands of poorly maintained or uncontrolled dumping sites contribute significantly to contamination of local aquifers , lakes , rivers , and ultimately the Baltic Sea . The lack of separation of various kinds of wastes is a major problem . Furthermore , the effects of past practices are monumental . For example , landfill and dumping sites around St. Petersburg contain about 200 million tons of mineral waste . In Poland , accumulated solid waste is estimated at 1,500 million tons . Agriculture <p> Important agricultural areas are located in Russia , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , and Poland , with the latter accounting for about 40 percent , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catchment . Except in Poland , large , formerly state-owned farms dominate ; their average size is more than 5,000 hectares . In Poland , the ownership structure is different ; about 80 percent of agricultural land is in small family farms with an average size of about 5 hectares ( although the number of large private farms is growing ) . <p> Agriculture in Denmark and southern Sweden relies quite heavily on fertilizers . Farming operations in the Danish part of the Belt Sea catchment , which has a total area of about 12,400 square kilometers , annually discharge about 30,000 tons of nitrogen into the sea , while operations in the much larger Vistula River basin , whose 166,000 square kilometers cover two-thirds of Poland and small portions of Belarus , the Slovak Republic , and Ukraine , discharge some 50,000 tons . As agriculture intensifies in Poland and other formerly communist countries , the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides must be avoided and alternatives developed . Otherwise , nutrient loading of the Baltic Sea will increase dramatically . <p> At present , inputs of nitrogen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Baltic Sea . They originate from ammonia volatilization , nitrogen leaching ( nitrate and organic nitrogen ) , phosphorus leaching , soil erosion , and the discharge of farm wastes , such as effluents from animal houses , manure storage , and silage heaps . Animal manures produced not only in the Baltic catchment but also in the North Sea catchment in Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , and France release ammonia into the atmosphere that is eventually deposited in the Baltic Sea . Nitrate leaching is mainly the result of inadequate handling and inefficient use of commercial fertilizers . Although livestock density is generally low , large animal farms -- for example , hog farms with 100,000 to 150,000 animals -- cause the most serious and difficult problems in handling animal manure . A Framework for Regional Action <p> The Baltic Sea 's environmental problems have been the concern of the surrounding countries for several decades . In 1974 , inspired by the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment , the governments of the region signed the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a provisional basis , and the convention formally entered into force in May 1980 . The Helsinki Commission ( HELCOM ) is the steering agency for the convention . Unfortunately , until the relatively recent political changes in the Baltic region , the activities of HELCOM concentrated on the open sea . As long as the coastline was shared by countries belonging to different military blocs , the coastal waters were largely inaccessible , and only extremely limited data on land-based pollution sources were available . <p> About 15 years after signing the initial Helsinki convention and as soon as the political situation in the region had changed , the prime ministers of Poland and Sweden invited their colleagues from the other countries in the Baltic catchment to a conference held in Ronneby , Sweden , in September 1990 . The participants at the Ronneby conference adopted the first Baltic Sea Declaration , which sets out a number of principles and priority actions necessary to enhance the Baltic environment . Most importantly , the conference signaled the launching of a concrete effort to " assure the ecological restoration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marine environment and preservation of its ecological balance . " 2 That effort is the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme . The program was developed from 1990 to 1992 by a HELCOM ad hoc high-level task force ( HLTF ) , which was a joint endeavor of the Baltic Sea countries ( Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Russia , and Sweden ) , the countries of the catchment area ( Belarus , the Czech Republic , the Slovak Republic , Norway , and Ukraine ) , the Commission of the European Communities , and four international financial institutions ( European Investment Bank , European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , Nordic Investment Bank , and World Bank ) . Also invited to attend HLTF meetings were several organizations that acted as observers , including the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission , the Coalition Clean Baltic , Greenpeace , and the World Wide Fund for Nature . The task force used a variety of studies and sources of information to develop the program , including national plans prepared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern , southern , and southwestern parts of the catchment. 3 The prefeasibility studies and special topical studies 4 were financed by grants totaling 5 million ECU from the Commission of the European Communities , the governments of Denmark , Finland , Germany , Norway , and Sweden , the Nordic Project Export Fund , and Sweden 's World Wide Fund for Nature . In April 1992 in Helsinki , the Diplomatic Conference of Ministers of the Environment revised the 1974 Helsinki convention and approved the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme . The Joint Comprehensive Programme <p> Nearly 20 years of scientific work by HELCOM committees and studies conducted for the HELCOM task force have followed ecological developments in the Baltic Sea catchment . This preparatory work for the program concluded that preventive and curative actions are necessary in all of the countries in the catchment to reduce the pollution load reaching the sea . Some of these actions are already under way : Some state-owned enterprises with polluting production activities have shut down ; wastewater treatment plants are planned or partly constructed ; new protected areas have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These ongoing activities require support ; in particular , new environmental policies and pollution control programs should be formulated and adopted in the formerly Eastern-bloc economies . The Strategy <p> The underlying strategy of the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme consists of actions by each concerned government to carry out needed policy and regulatory reforms ; to build capacity ; and to invest in controlling pollution from point and nonpoint sources , safely disposing of or reducing the generation of waste , and conserving ecologically sensitive and economically valuable areas . To complement these activities , the program also includes elements to support applied research , environmental awareness , and environmental education . These actions will be phased in to keep pace with the gradually increasing capacity to raise funds and pay for the recurrent costs of environmental management in the transforming economies . For the first few years , emphasis will be placed on creating the enabling policymaking environment and institutional arrangements , on making limited investments in the highest priority projects , including pilot and demonstration projects , and on promoting private investment and initiative through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and western parts of the region are also an integral part of the joint comprehensive program and are expected to be financed from local resources . Program Components <p> The program consists of six components that comprise broad and distinct areas of action . The first component is a set of policy , legal , and regulatory reforms that establish a long-term .. environmental management framework in each country , including macroeconomic policies and incentives ; financial facilities , policies , and controls ; environmental standards and laws ; and the appropriate systems for monitoring and enforcing these laws . To accomplish these goals , the program will encourage participating governments to undertake studies of new legal regulatory arrangements and drafting of governmental and parliamentary decision documents ; policy studies of options , costs , and benefits ; investment in new monitoring equipment , upgrading of laboratory equipment and procedures , and upgrading of data processing and analytical capacity ; and development of new organizational structures and arrangements to carry out management functions . The program will also promote the use of a range of economic measures for the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polluter pays principle , " adoption of realistic user charges , and introduction of cost sharing principles in the case of trans-boundary pollution . In addition , the program will seek to promote the adoption of the best environmental practices and the use of the best available technologies to prevent pollution at the source , consistent with the 1992 Helsinki convention ( an update of the 1974 convention that was signed at the Diplomatic Conference ) and HELCOM recommendations . Actions that facilitate the transfer of technology between and within cooperating countries will also be encouraged . <p> The second component of the program is institutional strengthening and human resources development : building the organizational and human capacity to enforce regulations ; planning , designing , and implementing environmental management systems , including infrastructure ; and managing natural resources efficiently . The program focuses on training people to use new concepts of management and new technology and developing the organizational and administrative framework for people to work effectively and efficiently . Priority will be given to support for environmental planning , river basin management , coastal zone management , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental management , the program will support the development of effective local authorities that are responsible for water supply , wastewater , and disposal of solid wastes . The program will also support the development of local capacity to carry out environmental audits by training personnel from local industries , consulting firms , and regulatory organizations . <p> The third component is a program for infrastructure investment in specific measures to control point and nonpoint sources of pollution and to minimize and dispose of wastes . These measures include the rehabilitation and modernization of existing infrastructure ; the development of new infrastructure ; and the conservation of environmentally sensitive areas and resources . This program includes investments in three areas : Investments in municipal environmental management will emphasize the collection , treatment , and disposal of wastewater . Existing municipal water systems in the region commonly include all or most of the industrial wastewater within the service area of the sewer network , which means that they are functioning as combined municipal and industrial wastewater systems . The program will support national and local activities to rationalize municipal water consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be provided for the completion of facilities already under construction , subject to design modification ( taking a least-cost approach ) and replacement of any substandard civil works . There are a number of such projects under way in the region 's " hot spots , " including Kaliningrad , Klaipeda , Liepaja , Tallinn , and Vilnius . Key operational problems , such as inadequate plant instrumentation and energy-inefficient equipment , will also be addressed . Industrial waste management at specific sites and complexes will also be financed . These projects are primarily for wastewater management , but they also address waste minimization , safe disposal of solid wastes , treatment and safe disposal of various forms of hazardous and toxic wastes , and environmental restoration from past degradation . Particular attention will be given to the pulp-and-paper industry , which has special significance in the region . Although this industry is perhaps most modern in the northern and western parts of the region , it is arguably one of the most outdated and inefficient in the eastern and southern portions . In both cases , the pulp-and-paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances . In addition , priority will be given to addressing wastewater treatment in the chemical and metal production and processing industries . Controlling polluted water runoff and discharges from agricultural lands , large livestock operations , and rural settlements is also an investment priority . Agriculture and livestock are major contributors of nutrient loads to the sea . Control measures will involve a wide range of changes in farming practices , including modifications in the timing of manure application and tillage ; improvements in farm infrastructure , such as larger capacity and more secure storage for fertilizers , manure , and farm wastes ; changes in water use ; and new equipment , such as manure spreading and waste handling equipment . The program will also support investment activities to reduce pollution problems resulting from fish farming . <p> The fourth component of the program is to aid in the management of coastal lagoons and wetlands . These environmentally sensitive and economically valuable areas serve as important buffers of pollution before it reaches the sea and provide critical habitat for diverse flora and fauna , including commercially important fisheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure and , in some cases , will be integrated with compatible ecotourism and recreation developments , possibly through joint public and private ventures or private investment . The program will support the development of a series of demonstration activities concerning the use of natural and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment and storm water retention and as traps for nutrients and other pollutants . <p> The program 's fifth part is supporting applied research to build the knowledge base needed to develop solutions , transfer technology , and broaden understanding of critical problems . Specific priority topics include environmental trends ; systems ecology ; development and application of the " critical load " concept for different pollutants in the Baltic Sea and its subregions ; assessments of risks to human health ; agricultural development patterns in the Baltic Sea basin ; future trends in transportation and its environmental management ; and management of critical ecosystems , such as coastal lagoons and wetlands . <p> Finally , the program will encourage public awareness and environmental education to develop a broad and sustainable base of support for the implementation of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and the development of effective environmental education programs are essential to promoting public awareness and political commitment . Efforts to promote and expand environmental education , particularly in the context of local environmental cleanup activities , will be given priority . <p> The 1992 Baltic Sea Declaration that was signed at the April 1992 Diplomatic Conference mandated that the key elements of the Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme be initiated in 1993 . Although the main responsibility for implementing the program will rest with the governments concerned , coordination of many program activities is needed . Such activities include monitoring pollution and the impact of the program , maintaining databases , reforming policies and regulations , providing technical assistance , planning research programs , and exchanging information , as well as periodically updating the program . To this end , the Programme Implementation Task Force has been set up within the framework of HELCOM . The Costs and Financing of the Program <p> The total cost of the 20-year program for all countries in the Baltic Sea catchment is estimated to be about 18 billion ECU ( about $25.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1997 , is projected to cost about 5 billion ECU ( about $6 billion ) . ( See Table I on page 28 . ) <p> The program will focus on remediating 132 " hot spots " ( see the map on page 14 ) , 98 of them located in Russia , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Belarus , Ukraine , Poland , the Czech Republic , and the Slovak Republic . These 98 actions will cost about 8.5 billion ECU , out of which 6.5 billion ECU will go toward 47 " priority hot spots , " including 26 municipal spots , 9 industrial spots , and 12 others . The remaining 34 hot spots , located in Denmark , Finland , Germany , and Sweden , have been selected by these countries themselves , and their remediation will cost approximately 1.5 billion ECU . In Poland , which has the largest land area and population in the Baltic Sea catchment , the estimated cost for remediating the 40 recommended hot spots and priority hot spots exceeds 4.0 billion ECU ( see " Report from Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the March 1991 Environment ) . <p> In phase 1 of the program 's implementation , the needs of 29 priority hot spots will be addressed , 19 in the Vistula and Oder river basins and 10 in Russia , Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania . In addition , major reductions in discharges of adsorbable organic halogens are planned for the pulp-and-paper industry in Finland and Sweden . <p> The immediate costs for the program total about 30 million ECU for the feasibility studies of the highest priority projects . Financial arrangements for the implementation of these projects can not be completed without the results of these studies . In addition , the governments in the eastern and southern parts of the catchment will need to arrange for local and external support to carry out the required policy and regulatory reforms . Timely implementation of the program critically depends on those and other noninvestment activities . To complicate matters , nearly two-thirds of the hot spots are located in countries whose current economic situation makes ordinary loans and commercial financing difficult . Therefore , some combination of normal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be needed from bilateral and multilateral financing agencies . Varied approaches to project financing are also needed , including enhanced local sources of revenue from taxes and user charges , user taxes on potentially polluting substances , and private investment that supplements traditional public-sector borrowing and budgetary resources . <p> In March 1993 , at the High Level Conference on Resource Mobilization for the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme in Gdansk , Poland , the participants stressed that availability of local or foreign funds is not the only constraint to program implementation ; several mutually related factors also limit the mobilization and flow of , and the capacity to use effectively , the funds that are available . Several important observations were made at the Gdansk conference. 6 First , the greatest proportion of project financing must come from local resources ; however , despite the efforts on the part of governments of the formerly communist countries , local resources will remain limited in the short term . Slow progress in this regard has been largely due to the precarious position of the economies in transition . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action should be taken to support the establishment of financing mechanisms and incentives , to develop the institutional capacity to implement them , and to create greater public awareness of their importance . " 7 The principal local sources of funds available to support activities under the program include user charges , pollution fees , budgetary allocations and nonbudgetary incentives , domestic loans , and , potentially , private investments . Domestic loans may not be a major factor in the near term because local financial institutions , such as capital markets and banks , have not been sufficiently developed to support environmental improvements . <p> Under the current economic conditions , however , the concerned countries , municipalities , and enterprises have sought increased support for program financing from external sources . Although some of the potential donor countries are suffering from a protracted recession , " there will be a critical need , at least for the short term , for continued and better coordinated support from bilateral donor organizations to implement the Programme , especially to support policy , institutional development and investment project preparation activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Communities and bilateral donors , from both within and outside the region , has been an important source of support for program activities in recent years . <p> In addition , the conference participants anticipated that " the international financing institutions will continue to provide loans and implement projects for selected priority actions under the Programme consistent with the requests of the borrowers and within lending limits established by their credit worthiness. " 9 The level of investment by international financing institutions is determined by the priorities of the borrowing country , the levels of borrowing and indebtedness that present and anticipated economic conditions are able to support , the balance of investment activities between priority sectors , the quality of the proposed investment , and the related characteristics and conditions of the borrower . <p> During phase 1 of the program 's implementation , special emphasis " must be put on comprehensive feasibility studies that yield economically and financially feasible and affordable investment projects , and that devote more attention to the assessment of the current institutional framework and the formulation of measures to strengthen that framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions will require special attention in phase 1 , including local fundraising , support for institutional reforms , support for industries in transition , and the phasing in of investments requiring long development periods . <p> The conference also acknowledged that , in the formerly communist countries , pollution control " at the source " will have to be incorporated into the ongoing privatization , restructuring , and modernization of industries . In the municipal sector , innovative approaches -- such as joint ventures with foreign capital and long-term concessions -- will be needed to attract capital financing , especially from private and commercial sources . Investments in municipal wastewater treatment plants must be seen within the broader framework of developing autonomous self-financing municipal and regional water and wastewater utilities , whether public or private . " 11 <p> The environment ministers and other representatives of the governments of the Baltic Sea countries and the representative of the Commission of the European Communities assembled at the Gdansk conference jointly decided to make all efforts to mobilize local , national , bilateral , and multilateral financial and other resources for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Phase 1 investment activities will concentrate on improving combined municipal and industrial wastewater treatment to reduce organic pollution loads . High-priority projects are the completion of unfinished or inoperable treatment facilities , the installation or improvement of pretreatment of industrial wastewater discharges into the municipal sewage systems , and the expansion of safe disposal of sludges . In the formerly centrally planned economies , nutrient-removal facilities ( tertiary treatment ) at municipal wastewater treatment plants will be deferred until more substantial progress is achieved in nutrient reductions in the agricultural sector . <p> As discussed at the Gdansk conference , 13 initial program activities have emphasized the establishment of priorities at the national level and detailed preparation of projects , including feasibility studies . Out of the 29 priority hot spots to be addressed in phase 1 , detailed feasibility studies are under way or are planned at 17 of the 26 priority municipal hot spots ; and environmental audits have been carried out at 6 of the 9 priority industrial hot spots . In addition , an economic and environmental assessment of the region 's pulp-and-paper industry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region 's 34 pulp-and-paper mills and focused on 12 mills that are candidates for feasibility studies and possible investment support . <p> The development of control programs for nonpoint source pollution in the agricultural and livestock sectors requires a different approach . The emphasis in phase 1 is on establishing an effective institutional framework and on developing and implementing well-designed pilot and demonstration activities . Seven pilot studies and programs have been established for the control of agricultural and livestock runoff in hot spot areas of Russia ( at a major hog farm in the St. Petersburg region ) , Estonia ( protection of groundwater from agricultural pollution ) , and Latvia , Lithuania , and Poland ( testing ecotechnologies in small catchment areas ) . Thirteen surveys , studies , and pilot programs have been established or are planned in the most important wetland areas and in the key coastal lagoons , which are mostly in Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , and Poland . In addition , the World Wide Fund for Nature , in cooperation with the countries of the region , is developing a regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central Matsalu Bay in Estonia , the north coast of Latvia , and Putsk Bay , which is a subsection of Gdansk Bay in Poland . <p> Although several factors have combined to slow the rate at which resources are committed to and used for various program activities , the first year of implementation has demonstrated that , despite all difficulties , a great deal can be accomplished . The foundations established during this early phase will ensure the long-term success of the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme . Expected Environmental Benefits <p> The program is expected eventually to have a major impact on the rivers in the Baltic Sea catchment , which are the principal source of water supply for industry , agriculture , and about 80 million people . Reducing pollution loads and restoring aquatic ecosystems will increase the quality and reliability of water resources and benefit the health and well-being of the local population . <p> The coastal waters are expected to improve most rapidly , which would allow several contaminated beaches to open again and contribute to re-establishing favorable conditions for tourism and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should reduce algal blooms , assist in lowering eutrophication levels , and improve oxygen conditions . These improvements should have a major positive impact on fishery resources , including an increase in the number and diversity of commercially valuable fish species , such as whitefish , cod , and plaice . The quality of the open sea will be restored more slowly , however , because of the difficulty in controlling long-range atmospheric transportation of various pollutants . <p> Another benefit of the program to Baltic countries is the strengthening of local capacities to plan , finance , and manage environmental measures . The strategic gains from capacity building for environmental cleanup will be of particular importance in the formerly centrally planned economies , which are undergoing profound institutional as well as economic changes . <p> Given the current state of the Baltic Sea environment , however , the program can not be expected to make any major impacts for about 20 years . But gradual and visible improvements , both environmental and economic , can be realized in the relatively near future . <p> 
@@4015141 Section : Articles Introduction <p> Background : Rotavirus infection is thought to be confined to the intestine . Reports of rotavirus RNA in the cerebral spinal fluid and serum of children infected with rotavirus suggest the possibility that rotavirus escapes the intestine into the circulatory system . We assessed whether rotavirus antigen , RNA , or both , were present in serum samples from immunocompetent rotavirus-infected children and animals . <p> Methods : We obtained sera from immunocompetent mice , rats , rabbits , and calves 1-10 days after inoculation with rotavirus or matched vehicle . We obtained sera retrospectively from immunocompetent children diagnosed with rotavirus diarrhoea ( n=33 ) , healthy children ( n=6 ) and adults ( n=12 ) , children convalescing from rotavirus ( n=6 ) , and children with non-rotavirus diarrhoea ( n=11 ) . Samples were analysed for the presence of rotavirus antigen or RNA by EIA or RT-PCR , respectively . <p> Findings : Rotavirus antigen was present in sera from rotavirus-infected animals , but not in sera from control animals . Infectious rotavirus or rotavirus RNA was detected in sera of mice and calves , respectively . Antigen was present in 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in none of 35 samples from controls . Detection of serum antigen was inversely related to the number of days between symptom onset and sample collection , and directly related to stool antigen concentration . Rotavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in three of six rotavirus-positive sera . <p> Interpretation : Rotavirus can escape the gastrointestinal tract in children , resulting in antigenaemia and possible viraemia . This finding is important for the understanding of the pathogenesis , immunology , and clinical manifestations of rotavirus infection . <p> Rotavirus is a common pathogen that is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. 1 Dehydration due to rotavirus-induced diarrhoea and vomiting results in high mortality rates in developing countries and a large economic burden in developed countries. 1 Rotavirus infection is thought to be localised to the gastrointestinal tract . However , there have been reports of rotavirus RNA in cerebral spinal fluid and serum of rotavirus-infected children. 2-7 Rotavirus non-structural proteins have also been reported in liver and kidney sections from rotavirus-infected immunocompromised children , suggesting that extraintestinal spread of rotavirus can occur during infection. 8 Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotavirus infection is not contained within the gastrointestinal tract. 9 , 10 These findings suggest the possibility that rotavirus escapes the intestine into the circulatory system . We assessed whether rotavirus antigen can be identified in sera from immunocompetent , rotavirus-infected children and animals , with the aim of better understanding the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection . Methods <p> Immunocompetent suckling and adult mice , suckling rats , adult rabbits , and newborn colostrum-deprived calves were gastrically inoculated with rotaviruses derived from homologous or heterologous species ( table ) or with matched vehicle . Stool and serum samples were obtained 1-10 days after inoculation . Care was taken to ensure that serum samples were not contaminated with rotavirus from stools by using gloves and sterile supplies , and disinfecting and swabbing the site with ethanol during cardiac puncture ( mouse ) , ear bleed ( rabbit ) , tail bleed ( rat ) , and jugular vein puncture ( cow ) . Stool and serum samples were analysed with Pathfinder Rotavirus EIA ( BioRad , Hercules , CA , USA ) or in-house EIAs. 11 Three cow serum samples were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VP7 outer capsid protein ) by use of consensus primers. 12 RNA was extracted using trizol ( Life Technologies , Frederick , MD , USA ) and negative controls ( water run through every four to five serum samples ) were included to detect contamination . <p> To test whether infectious virus was present in serum ( ie , could pass from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood ) , we inoculated 28 rotavirus-naive adult mice each with 100 mL of serum : 11 with sera from 11 rotavirus-infected adult mice ; three with sera from three different pools of rotavirus-infected infant mice serum ; 11 controls with sera from 11 adult mice inoculated with vehicle ; and three controls with pooled sera from three non-infected infant mice . Rotavirus infection was established by the excretion of high concentrations of faecal antigen ( measured by EIA ) . Samples from these animal models were assessed 4 days after viral inoculation . <p> Human serum samples were obtained retrospectively from Texas Children 's Hospital ( TCH ) in Houston , TX , USA ( five children ) and Royal Children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ) . All serum samples were obtained from immunocompetent children , aged 1-36 months , presenting with acute gastroenteritis confirmed by EIA ( Rotazyme , Abbot Laboratories TCH and in-house serotyping RCH ) 13 of a 10% weight-for-volume stool sample to be rotavirus positive . Inclusion in the study was dependent on sufficient serum remaining from a blood sample . At RCH , samples were obtained within 7 days of onset of symptoms . Convalescent sera were also obtained from six of the rotavirus-positive children at RCH when they were asymptomatic , which was 29-42 days from presentation with rotavirus gastroenteritis . Control sera were obtained from : ( 1 ) six healthy children ( aged 2-21 months ) at RCH whose stool samples were rotavirus-antigen negative by EIA ; ( 2 ) 12 adult volunteers associated with the Enteric Virus Research Group , RCH ; ( 3 ) a child at TCH who was rotavirus-stool negative by EIA and electronmicroscopy and who presented with acute gastroenteritis due to a Norwalk virus infection confirmed by RT-PCR ; ( 4 ) and ten children ( aged 6-24 months ) who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with non-rotavirus pathogens ( eg , Salmonella spp , adenoviruses , and astrovirus ) .

We do not provide formal proof that rotavirus present in serum samples from infected children is infectious . However , animal data from this and other studies suggests that rotavirus antigen detected in serum of rotavirus-infected mice is infectious even in the presence of serum factors that might inhibit infectivity ( table ) . 15 Direct proof of infectious particles in serum from children was not possible since no small animal models are proven to be susceptible to infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that viraemia seems likely in children and could account for the association of rotavirus infection with extraintestinal clinical manifestations . <p> Previous reports of the extraintestinal presence of rotavirus in children and infants have been much debated . Most of these studies included only small numbers of children . Much scepticism has surrounded the RT-PCR detection of rotavirus RNA in cerebral spinal fluid , arising from the concern that these results could result from stool rotavirus contamination during lumbar-puncture sample collection. 2-7 However , many symptoms that would be consistent with the extraintestinal spread of rotavirus have been reported in case studies of rotavirus-infected children during the past 20 years : pneumonia , 17 exanthema , 17 disseminated intravascular coagulation , 18 haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis , 19 and neurological complications such as encephalitis or encephalopathy , 3 , 5 , 19 , 20 cerebellitis , 21 or convulsions or seizures. 2 , 4-6 With no proof of extraintestinal spread , these findings remain only associations , and although they suggest that rotavirus might be related to these symptoms , there is no direct proof that rotavirus infection causes symptoms other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been only a few reports of the detection of rotavirus RNA in blood or other components of the circulatory system in children . Morrison and colleagues 22 used in-situ RT-PCR to analyse the tissues involved in fatal rotavirus infections in two children , and noted viral RNA in the heart and CNS , mainly localised to endothelial cells . Ushijima and colleagues 7 and Nishimura and colleagues 2 found rotavirus RNA using RT-PCR in two of seven serum samples from children with rotavirus diarrhoea. 2 , 7 Our findings ( three of six serum samples from rotavirus-infected children positive for rotavirus RNA ) are consistent with theirs and support the notion that intact rotavirus virions are present in serum during rotavirus infection . However , the design and sensitivity of RT-PCR approaches do not rule out possible stool rotavirus contamination of the serum samples . Because our sample size was small , definitive conclusions about the percentage of samples with rotavirus RNA can not be drawn from these data . However , based on results by Gouvea and colleagues , 14 RT-PCR detection of rotavirus doublestranded RNA has comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitivity of our EIA ( 10 4 particles ) 11 is about one log 10 lower than RT-PCR ( 10 5 particles ) , which accounts for the detection of RNA in only 50% of the antigen-positive serum samples . Other reasons for the inability to detect viral RNA in all samples could be virus breakdown in serum resulting from repeated freezing and thawing ( a difficulty mentioned by the manufacturers of the RNA extraction kit ) , or the presence of PCR inhibitors in serum . <p> Findings of rotavirus antigens in conjunction with rotavirus RNA in serum would have lent more credence to the presence of rotavirus viraemia . Previous reports have not noted rotavirus antigens in serum in conjunction with rotavirus RNA . Saulsbury and colleagues 23 did not detect rotavirus antigen using enzyme-linked fluorescent assay in 14 immunocompetent children admitted to hospital with rotavirus infection . However , three of four rotavirus-infected immunocompromised children did have rotavirus antigen in the blood. 23 Rotavirus proteins have also been detected by immunohistochemical techniques in immunocompromised children with rotavirus infections in extraintestinal sites such as the liver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunocompetent children with fatal rotavirus infections. 8 , 22 The findings of Saulsbury and colleagues contrast with our findings that 22 of 33 immunocompetent children acutely infected with rotavirus infection had detectable rotavirus antigen in serum in the first few days after disease onset . Our results , and the fact that we did not detect rotavirus antigen in convalescent serum , serum from healthy children or adult volunteers , or serum from children with non-rotavirus-associated acute gastroenteritis , show the specificity of the EIA that we used . Differences in sensitivities between Saulsbury and colleagues 1 and our diagnostic approach could , in part , account for the differing results . We have shown that stool antigen concentrations and the number of days between onset of diarrhoea and serum collection affect the ability to detect serum antigen . Thus , the timing of sample collection could have adversely affected Saulsbury and colleagues 1 results . Additionally , rotavirus-specific antibodies or other factors in serum could have hindered detection of rotavirus antigen in serum in both studies . <p> Our work raises the question of how rotavirus escapes the intestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family that contains rotavirus , use transepithelial transport through M cells . These cells are a specialisation of the mucosal epithelium that overlies the Peyer 1s patches , which act as conduits to the immune , lymphatic , and circulatory systems. 24 Rotavirus antigens have been detected in M cells , and these cells could provide rotavirus with access to the bloodstream . <p> Further investigations are needed to establish the importance of our findings in understanding rotavirus pathogenesis , the relation between extraintestinal spread and the severity of disease and tissue damage , the role of viraemia in the immune response , and induction of protective immunity against reinfection . In light of our findings , further studies are needed to reassess the frequency and importance of extraintestinal symptoms associated with rotavirus infection . <p> Contributors : <p> S E Blutt designed and coordinated the study , collected data , and wrote the manuscript .

@@4017841 Engineering technology gets more work in the operating room . <p> The puzzles that engineers and doctors face have much in common . The human body , after all , can be thought of as an engineered system . Blood flowing through the body , for instance , mirrors airflow through an engine . It 's natural then , that medical researchers should appropriate for their own purposes engineering analysis technology originally developed to predict the flow of fluids through engines or of water around bridge stanchions . As these technologies find a home in hospitals and doctors ' offices , they 'll change the way surgeons assess patients ' conditions and operate . Analysis software lets surgeons plan an operation , by mapping it specifically to the patient 's body . Doctors will predict how a patient will respond to a medical implant and plot implantation accordingly , say researchers who work to configure engineering technologies for medical use . A Cultural Coming Together <p> David Gosman - professor of computational fluid dynamics at Imperial College of Science , Technology , and Medicine in London - uses computational fluid dynamics to study blood flow . He says engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But my impression is that it 's still the early days , " he said . " CFD is relatively new , so it 'll take a while to become known and appreciated . <p> " We need more research to fully understand what simulations can offer and how to use that information , " he added . " And the tool needs to be put into an easy-to-use form so that it can be routinely applied to cardiovascular studies without the need for CFD specialists . " <p> Of course , before technology used and developed by engineers can shift to the medical world , the separate cultures need to find a common point of departure . <p> The medical researchers , often engineers themselves , have to understand how doctors work and how they 'd accept using a computer as a tool in the operating room . But in the subtle world of medical problem solving , doctors also have to accept that the cold , hard numbers that drive the computational methods behind analysis software do provide answers . <p> " A fascinating , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results when the two fields must by necessity work together to develop medical equipment or methods , " Gosman said . <p> Professionals in the two fields use different terminology and approach measurement and simulation from different angles . <p> " We found the different jargons initially to be a real barrier , but this was gradually overcome with give and take on both sides , " Gosman said . <p> Still , for many doctors , computers and surgery just do n't mix , said Anthony Petrella , manager of the computational biomechanics group at DePuy Orthopaedics Inc. of Warsaw , Ind . The company makes almost every type of replacement joint . <p> Medical researchers at DePuy are working to repurpose CAE software with an eye toward visualizing and analyzing the . human body . Petrella said the company wants to use analysis software to improve joint replacement surgery . Doctors would use the software to predict how a patient 's new joint will likely wear and how tissue will respond to the artificial joint . Guided by those predictions , they can position the joint to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Joint replacement has become almost routine . Many U.S. surgeons perform joint replacement operations . For some , that 's almost all they do . Therefore they have little time to incorporate a new system into their daily routines . <p> " Surgeons are skeptical of computational methods , " Petrella said . " Still , new doctors today are tech savvy . They played computer games as kids . " <p> Computer-assisted surgeries , in which doctors get real-time information about their patients as they operate , are becoming more common , but computers still are n't usual operating room tools . Many surgeons do n't feel comfortable using them , Petrella said . He spoke in May at a user conference sponsored by Ansys in its home town of Pittsburgh . DePuy 's research uses Ansys software for analysis . <p> A medical tool of today could be used in the operating room to capture information about the patient 's condition and feed it to a computer . According to Petrella , fluoroscopy - essentially a moving X-ray of a patient 's joint - can visualize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis for the computer model to predict how the joint would wear over time and how surrounding tissue might react to the synthetic material . <p> Researchers can calculate when and how a patient 's artificial joint will wear . But creating a model to predict how tissue will respond to the new joint is a different ball game entirely , Petrella said . Healthy tissue can respond any number of ways to the implant . It might become stiff or change shape over time . Analysis codes are hard to write for that type of intangible . <p> Still , Petrella and his fellow researchers say a computer program is within reach that will feed surgeons information unique to each patient . Help For a Weak Heart <p> David Gosman and his team at Imperial College are adapting technology originally developed to simulate airflow through a reciprocating internal combustion engine so that it can be applied to study the human heart . <p> CFD is most commonly used now to plan heart-bypass surgery . Surgeons simulate blood flow through the heart via CFD then program their findings into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gosman 's research , on the other hand , aims to simulate how a weak heart muscle affects blood flow . The simulations would help researchers improve pacemakers and artificial heart valves . <p> " Doctors have been interested for some time in knowing about blood-flow behavior in the heart and how it differs between healthy patients and those suffering from heart illnesses , " Gosman said . <p> Little is known about the effects of heart irregularities on the flow , Gosman said . <p> " And there 's even less understanding of how pacemakers can be designed to control the heart motion in a way to restore the healthy pattern , " he added . " What kind of motion is necessary to achieve that ? " <p> Though CFD has already been used extensively to study artificial valves , little research has been done to evaluate how they affect blood flow when actually placed in a patient , Gosman said . His simulations will look at that . <p> Measurement techniques like magnetic resonance imaging give doctors information about patient blood flow and offer them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or artificial heart valve , but MRIs do n't return the level of detail that CFD simulations depict , Gosman said . His approach combines MRIs with CFD simulation . <p> The information obtained by an MRI is in the form of a thin , two-dimensional image slice . Gosman and his team take MRIs at varied parts of a ventricle as it fills with and empties of blood . The images combine to show how the chamber looks during the entire cycle . <p> That image is then modeled with CFD . For modeling , the team uses Star-CD software from CD-adapco of New York . Gosman is also director and vice president of technology of CD-adapco . <p> With the model , doctors can predict how blood flow would change if a pacemaker or artificial valve were placed in the heart . It also lets doctors look at what-if scenarios that they ca n't run on the real subjects . <p> At first , the simulations would be used to help diagnose patients , and Gosman hopes that doctors eventually will study a particular patient 's CFD simulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta are also studying blood flow . They have an eye toward using the information to design better artificial heart valves . <p> Numerical modeling techniques originally developed by the institute to simulate how water flows around hydraulic structures like bridge foundations is finding a second use in helping researchers better understand blood flow patterns through artificial mechanical heart valves . <p> The research could yield the most accurate depiction yet of the turbulent environment that blood cells and platelets encounter as they pass through the mechanical heart valve , said Fotis Sotiropoulos , an associate professor in the schools of civil and environmental engineering and mechanical engineering . He 's researching the system along with Ajit Yoganathan , who directs Georgia Tech 's cardiovascular fluid mechanics laboratory . <p> Doctors replace poorly functioning natural-heart valves with prosthetic valves . But present-day designs are far from ideal . <p> They can destroy blood platelets or permit a particle that has broken away from a blood clot to block a blood vessel . These complications likely come about because the blood is exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical prosthesis , Sotiropoulos said . <p> Doctors also think the complex blood flow patterns around the valve may trigger a cellular response that can lead to the onset of heart diseases . <p> But before the artificial valves can be redesigned , researchers need an in-depth understanding of the flow fields that the valves induce . <p> To date , the fluid mechanics of heart valves has been largely studied by way of experiments , Sotiropoulos said . His research is an attempt to apply both CFD and experimentation to the problem . <p> Cardiovascular flows generally pose unique challenges to even the most advanced CFD tools available today . The interaction between blood motion and compliant vascular walls leads to a very complex fluid-structure problem , he said . <p> Yet Sotiropoulos believes that CFD is developed well enough today to tackle the problem . " Computational resources and especially the advent of massively parallel clusters in the past decade have made it feasible to attempt such complex computations in very demanding simulations , " he said . ( Massively parallel clusters assemble many conventional CPUs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large problem . ) <p> Still , his team relies on the results of physical experiments to prove the accuracy of their CFD simulations . An in vitro experiment can use an anatomically realistic model of the human heart , through which researchers can pump blood . They can compare results against those of a CFD model . In vivo information is also available in the MRIs of patients . <p> " Experiments have to accompany CFD modeling to provide it with the credibility medical practitioners need to be convinced they can rely on such modeling tools to make decisions that could ultimately affect the span and quality of the life of the patient , " Sotiropoulos said . <p> The Georgia Tech team ultimately wants their tools to be used in what they call virtual surgery .

@@4009641 In discussing his method of doing research , Robert Coles ( 1990 ) describes several of his asssumptions : <p> .... we as human beings possess awareness or consciousness , and through language , we try to understand the world around us and convey what we have learned to others . I have also assumed that if I talked to people who were willing to share thoughts and feelings , express ideas , then I would feel a bit more informed . I stop well short of large-scale generalizations .... ( 22 ) <p> We share Coles 's assumptions . Students in a class taught by the first author are required to engage in dialogue regarding a values issue that is important to them . The values issue discussed here is the relationship between science and aesthetics . We make no generalizations from the dialogue . Rather , like Coles ( 1990 ) , we want " to learn from young people their exquisitely private sense of things . . . " ( 37 ) . Even though this was our modest intent , we also learned something about the art/science of teaching , which we share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edited dialogue between the teacher and juniors in a high school chemistry class , tape recorded with the students ' permission . The " I " of the conversation is the second author . Aesthetics and High School Chemistry <p> I have taught chemistry for several years at the high-school level . I am also interested in art . When I share these two interests with students , they often reply that I must feel divided , like two persons in one body . I have come to realize that many students view the sciences and the humanities as being mutually exclusive areas of human interest and inquiry . <p> I asked my chemistry class if they perceived science and aesthetics as mutually exclusive or as symbiotic , supportive concerns . <p> The response was a collective , " Huh ? " <p> I did not want to provide too much of a glimpse of my personal perspective by over-explaining what I meant . Instead , I read them a paragraph from a book by a bongo-playing , Nobel Prize-winning physicist , Richard Feynman , whom one student had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ever encountered . I had read excerpts from other physicists before , in the hope of convincing my students that scientists come in a plethora of shapes and sizes and are not limited to the mail-order , pocket-protector , Coke-bottle-glasses variety . <p> The following , from Feynman ( 1988 ) , is what I read : <p> I have a friend who 's an artist , and he sometimes takes a view which I do n't agree with . He 'll hold up a flower and say , " Look how beautiful it is , " and I 'll agree . But then he 'll say , " I , as an artist , can see how beautiful a flower is . But you , as a scientist , take it all apart and it becomes dull . " I think he 's kind of nutty . <p> . . . Although I might not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is , I can appreciate the beauty of a flower . But , at the same time , I see much more in the flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other processes . There are all kinds of interesting questions that come from a knowledge of science , which only adds to the excitement and mystery and awe of a flower . It only adds . I do n't understand how it subtracts. ( 27-28 ) <p> I told the students that both Richard and the artist could be right and that I wanted to know how they felt . <p> One student spoke up . " Well , ever since you told us why the sky is blue , whenever I walk around outside and see the sky , it seems better , prettier because I know why now . " <p> " You know , " said another , " I hated science before chemistry . " <p> Someone in the back of the room muttered , " I still hate science . But now , wherever I look , I think about class -- what we talk about and stuff like that . " <p> " What do you mean by that ? " I asked . <p> Another student responded for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world more interesting . You know , now when I take a bath , since I know how soap works , I think how interesting it is that there is a reason why soap cleans up dirt . Before , I would just take a bath and not even think about anything . It did n't seem special . Now it seems , well , you know , unique . Knowing that there are reasons for things makes me wonder about other things . Chemistry makes the world come alive for me . " <p> Another student , one who consistently scored 100 percent on tests , disagreed . " Oh , well , science certainly makes you appreciate the world more . That I agree with . But it does n't make it more beautiful . " <p> " Why ? " I asked . <p> " When I was little and looked at a rainbow , I used to think how beautiful that rainbow was -- how exciting it was that there was a pot of gold at the end . It was magical . Now all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refracted light . Whoopee , " she stated somewhat dejectedly . <p> " So , what you 're saying is that science diminishes beauty , " I continued . <p> She responded , " It does n't necessarily diminish it . You just look less at what something looks like and more at why it is . I know that sounds silly . " <p> " It is n't silly , " I responded . " You know , there 's something to be said for simplicity , and when you start looking at things scientifically , you do n't see the beauty as much . " <p> Another student entered the discussion . " Science complicates things so much that you are no longer able to see the beauty in things . I agree with the artist . When my mother points to a flower and mentions how beautiful it is , all I can think of are the different names for the different parts of the plant , all the stuff I had to memorize for tests . " <p> I asked him if there was anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or interesting to him . <p> " No , I ca n't think of anything , " he answered . <p> " Nothing at all ? " I inquired . <p> " Hm , " he started . " I suppose that I liked learning about the gas laws . You know , why food takes longer to cook in the mountains and stuff like that . I told my mom how a pressure cooker cooks the beans so fast . That was interesting . She told me to buy her one . " <p> The discussion continued for some time with the slant of perspectives shifting back and forth . Probably , because of the subtle , yet manipulative , game I play as teacher , more of the students tended to believe that science and aesthetics are compatible with one another . The final consensus was that whether science does or does not make the world more beautiful , it certainly helps a person appreciate it more . A Dialogue With Chemistry <p> Another device to help students " see " the aesthetic side of science is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If chemistry could speak , what would it say of itself ? " The students in our classes discovered that taking some time even to write down a page or two of dialogue led them to insights about science , especially regarding its holistic nature . As one student said , " Chemistry class is not only about chemistry . It is about the way things are , about the whole of things . " This is what we call an aesthetic aspect of chemistry . What follows is a dialogue with " chemistry " that one student wrote . <p> CHEMISTRY : often feel little understood . It seems students do n't especially like me -- that , for most students , chemistry is the mere repetition of facts filled in by a few experiments . <p> STUDENT : It sounds like you are hurt and sad . <p> CHEMISTRY : Yes . In fact , did you know that some people are talking about me as they do my friend mathematics ? They think I 'm a mental disorder , a phobia of some kind . <p> STUDENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of anxiety for many students ? <p> CHEMISTRY : It 's sad that you think difficulty is related to anxiety . Are n't things which are difficult , which are new , worth doing ? Literature , who is really my brother and sister , is difficult for many students to learn . But , I 've never heard of anyone talking about literature phobia , as they do about mathematics and me . <p> STUDENT : That 's a good point . But , why do you say literature is your brother and sister ? Are n't you and literature completely different ? I mean you deal with facts and experiments , and literature deals with characters , plots , etc . <p> CHEMISTRY : Well , I look at literature and myself as games . In literature , it 's sometimes hide and seek , trying to find the thread that connects events in the story . Are n't games fun ? They may be difficult to learn , but the fun and cooperation one finds through many games make their pursuit worthwhile . <p> STUDENT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHEMISTRY : YOU do n't mean to tell me your teacher has you do me alone , in private , do you ? I 'm more like dancing than jogging . And partners are needed for dancing . <p> STUDENT : How are you like dancing ? <p> CHEMISTRY : I have a rhythm , that is , I relate to all that is . I 'm like the waves of an ocean , belonging to the vast sea , able to be separated from it when someone watches a single wave , as when a student concentrates on a particular chemical , but always going back into the vast expanse of sea . I 'm a part of everything , like numbers and shapes . I constitute all that is . I create harmony and integration and feel saddened that that which is a part of me , some students do n't appreciate . Are people afraid of the waves ? No . They might be frightened by the sea , but not when they approach the sea wave by wave . The same with me . If students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but can see and appreciate me in everything , in their daily lives , how I help people , like watching the wave calms people down , maybe they will begin to see me as a friend , too . <p> STUDENT : Thanks , Chemistry . I 'll share our little talk with the class . You sure gave me a different view of you than I previously had . I 'll be talking to you again , soon . <p> CHEMISTRY : I 'll look forward to it . <p> As the class discussed the various dialogues , we all became aware of apparently hidden dimensions of chemistry , especially aesthetic dimensions like " appreciation , " " harmony , " and " integration . " This exercise left many of us with a new wonder and excitement about chemistry . Reflection <p> Coles ( 1990 ) notes that even though he attempts to let students discuss a particular issue or concept without evaluating , " . . . yet even so , I , the listening physician , anxious to order things , grabbed for conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Perhaps this is the occupational hazard of ethnographic researchers . Yet , the intent of the above types of dialogue ( as with Coles 's research ) is to be a learner among learners . Through the above dialogues , we see that students develop values perspectives , especially aesthetic values , in chemistry class . There is more going on than the learning of content . <p> We also realized that the teacher may find it difficult , if not impossible , to avoid manipulating a class discussion . But , if teachers are aware of their influence ( in a values sense of science versus aesthetics ) , they can choose either to consciously share their values perspectives or to minimize their hidden , often subtle , agendas . The issue , then , is : How do teachers avoid manipulating students ? How do teachers provide students with the opportunity for self-reflection and values discovery and disclosure ? <p> The teaching style that avoids manipulation ( as much as this is possible to avoid ) we call " the art of being consciously nonaggressive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students feel confident enough to speak openly about issues . Amazingly enough , however , something about this conscious nonaggression forces the student to internal self-reflection without being judged by the teacher . In other words , conscious nonaggression makes the students feel comfortable about discussing issues in class , but , at the same time , something about the method makes students reflect upon their answers and recognize when their answers are less than fully formed . All this occurs without creating either fear or a negative sense of self . <p> One could still ask , " What is the value of the above sorts of dialogue ? No generalizable conclusions were reached . " Coles ( 1990 ) notes that children ask " the eternal questions ... more intensely , unremittingly , and subtly than we sometimes imagine " ( 37 ) . The above kind of exchange affords students the opportunity to ask such questions in a legitimate , dialogical environment . To not offer such an opportunity may be to make an idol out of content . As John Dewey ( 1944 ) argued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than facts and information . Education embraces processes for integrating and broadening subject matter . <p> Likewise , many teachers wonder about the kind of " real " influence that they have on students , especially on those depressing days when nothing seems to go right . As Robert Fulgrum ( 1988 ) notes , wisdom is not a high priority even in graduate school . To us , wisdom is , among other things , the ability to examine , cognitively and affectively , the relationship , if any , between science and aesthetics . That is , wisdom consists of perceiving value interrelationships -- seeing the subject differently , as from another point of view . Perhaps if wisdom ( interrelating disciplines , for example ) were pursued more in public schools , it would become a part of the graduate school agenda . <p> The most important aspect of the above sorts of dialogue is self-knowledge . Our students were encouraged to express their opinions without criticism . The teacher acted as a guide , a facilitator : a questioner among questioners . Education is a life-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration -- discovering parts of oneself one did not know existed . <p> The students in the chemistry class all had opinions about the relationship between science and aesthetics , but we wonder if they all knew they did . And , we wonder what they learned about themselves when they clarified the question . Perhaps some learned that the artist and the scientist are on similar quests . Perhaps others learned that there was an aesthetic , appreciative side to themselves that they hardly knew they valued . Perhaps still others learned that they could appreciate themselves ( as they could appreciate the flower ) without overly analyzing themselves . And perhaps other students realized the need to look at themselves through analytical lenses . <p> Coles ( 1990 ) refers to education as a " march through life " ( 335 ) : <p> So it is we connect with one another , move in and out of another 's lives , teach , heal , and affirm one another , across space and time -- all of us wanderers , adventurers , stragglers and ramblers , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pilgrims .... Yet how young we are when we start wondering about it all . ( 335 ) <p> Dialogues like the above make pilgrims and wonderers out of us all . Such journeys bring revelations , in cognitive , affective , and values senses . Yet a journey demands taking steps . The destination needs to be somewhere . We suggest " conscious nonaggression " as a framework by which to permit the trip . The rest of the adventure will be , willingly , freely , taken by the students . Is this art or science ? The reader needs to journey , too . <p>

Neither ethical and scientific arguments against compulsory tests as a means of gathering information ' ( 1 ) nor operational objections ( 2 ) dissuaded the Prison Service from extending its war on drugs ' to all prison establishments in England and Wales by March 1996 . <p> The 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act permits both random and on suspicion ' selection of prisoners from whom a urine sample can be required and tested for drugs . During the pilot phase of mandatory testing , random sampling has been organised from Prison Service headquarters . Refusal to provide the required urine sample breaches prison rules and is punishable by 28 days ' loss of remission . Prisoners whose urine sample tests positive for cannabis only are liable to punishment of 14 days ' loss of remission , and 21 days if their sample is positive for class A drugs such as heroin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory ) drugs testing ( MDT ) to the healthcare budget for a prison and to the cost of putting in place a prisons ' drugs reduction programme . We compare average , not marginal , costs . The former will tend to the latter in the medium term , however , as additional prison places and staff are eventually required to avoid disorder in the prisons occasioned by overcrowding and undermanning . <p> We use data from Scotland to put in context the extent of the injecting drug use problem prisons face . Methods <p> Table 1 shows cost-generating events for MDT , unit costs , and applicable percentages from the MDT pilot study. ( 3 ) We assume that 10% of prisoners are required to provide a urine sample , as in the pilot study . Refusal rate of between 0 and 10% is assumed , and was quoted as 8% in a personal communication in May , 1995 from the then Director-General of the Prison Service . We estimated the cost of loss of remission from the Prison Service Annual Report and Accounts ( 4 ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are assumed to be positive on SYVA testing ( 5 ) and to remain positive on confirmation by gas chromatography -- mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) . 20% urine samples negative on SYVA testing are assumed to be rechecked and confirmed as negative by GC-MS ( this simplification ignores false positive and false negative SYVA test results . ) <p> Cross-sectional Willing Anonymous Salivary HIV ( WASH ) surveillance studies and risk-factor elicitation in Scottish prisons6 and at Bullindon Prison near Oxford have shown that 20% or more ( 6 ) prisoners have injected drugs ; that 50% of injectors have injected in prison , probably currently7 as well as ever. ( 6 ) We therefore assume that 10% of all inmates inject class A drugs inside prison currently but the proportion who inject regularly , for example twice a week , has not been documented . A class A drug such as heroin remains detectable in urine for 3 days . <p> Answers to parliamentary questons in May 1995 , concerning the outcome since February 1995 , of MDT in pilot prisons , ( 8 ) revealed that 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three for heroin/benzodiazepines . Our assumptions were based on these figures . Results <p> In accordance with the assumptions in table 1 , tables 2a and b give estimates of the cost per 28 days of the random mandatory drugs testing control initiative in an establishment for 500 inmates where the refusal rate is 10% ( table 2a ) or 0% ( table 2b ) ; and 35% of urine samples test positive , one tenth of these for class A drugs as reported in Parliament in May 1995. ( 8 ) Costs are estimated at between UK22 800 ( $US35 100 ) and UK16 000 ( $US24 600 ) per 28 days . Major cost-generating events are the punishment of refusals ( more than 33% of cost in table 2a ) and of testing positive for cannabis ( over 50% of cost in table 2a and over 80% of cost in table 2b ) . Costs decrease roughly in proportion to any decrease in penalty days , because the cost of testing is relatively minor in terms of overall cost . <p> The 1993-94 Report of the Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure from April , 1993 , to March , 1994 , as UK58.215 million pounds ( at 1993-94 prices ) ; equivalent to UK4.4658 million per 28 days ( $US6.877 million ) . Since the average prison occupancy for the same period was 53020 , healthcare expenditure for an establishment with 500 prisoners averaged UK42114 per 28 days ( $US64860 ) . The cost of random MDT per 28 days is thus equivalent to about half the healthcare budget of such a prison . <p> Experts in treatment of drug abuse estimate that it costs UK100 000 per annum ( $US154 000 ) to run a drugs reduction and rehabilitation programme in a prison with 500 inmates ( personal communication , Mr Tony O'Regan , Co-ordinator of Drugs and Alcohol Services , Huntingdon , UK ) ; less than half the cost of random MDT . <p> Table 3 shows regional data on estimated number of injecting drug users by capture-recapture methods. ( 10-12 ) HIV prevalence in injectors from community HIV surveillance studies , ( 13-15 ) together with number of injector-inmates derived from cross-sectional WASH surveillance studies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HIV-infected injector-inmates . Data on the size of populations ( 20 ) were also required . The prevalence of injecting drug use varies geographically and prevalence in men may be almost twice that for women . HIV prevalence in current injecting drug users also varies geographically . It is , for example , much higher for injectors from Scotland 's east coast -- Lothian and Tayside regions -- than those from Greater Glasgow or Liverpool . Despite geographical variation in the prevalence of injecting drug use , consistently across the regions about 7% of male injectors are in prison at any time . The proportion is lower for women ; only 1% of Greater Glasgow 's female injectors were in Cornton Vale , Scotland 's only prison for female offenders. ( 6 , 19 ) We thus estimate that 5.4% ( table 3 , 469/8700 ) of Greater Glasgow 's injectors are in prison at any time ( this is the only region in the UK with all necessary data available for both sexes ) . <p> Corroboration comes from another source . The Scottish Affairs Committee , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) estimated that there were 20 000 injecting drug users in Scotland , or some 11 300 outside Greater Glasgow . Two thirds of these , around 7500 , would be expected to be male . Cross-sectional WASH surveillance in 1991-95 covered some 40% of the Scottish male prison population and included 150 male drug injectors from outside Greater Glasgow ( table 3 ) . This leads to an estimate of 375 ( 150/0.4 ) non-Glasgow injectors in all prisons for men , or 5% of male injectors outside of Greater Glasgow being in prison at any time . <p> Thus , since 5% of a region 's injectors are incarcerated at any time , it would appear reasonable that around 5% of the region 's drugs prevention and treatment budget and an apportionment of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget should be assigned to its prisons . Lothian 's 1993-94 Drug Abuse Services cost UK138 473 for care and treatment , and UK1052 029 for prevention ; and the AIDS/HIV projects cost UK5079171 for care and treatment and 1670277 for prevention ( totals of UK1190 552 and 6749 488 , respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half Lothian 's HIV diagnoses have been in injecting drug users , ( 20 ) we assume that half the region 's HIV/AIDS prevention budget has targeted injectors . Five percent of Lothian 's drugs care , treatment and prevention costs and 2.5% of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget amounts to UK101 300 -- or UK7770 per 28 days ( $US11 970 ) -- and about 35% of monthly MDT costs . <p> After the parliamentary questions in May 1995 , further questions elicited the information that from February to May , 1995 , there were 1089 random MDT tests , of which 362 ( 33.2% ) were positive for cannabis and 44 ( 4.1% ) positive for opiates or benzodiazepines : but from June to December 1995 , when there were 2282 random tests , 663 ( 29.1% ) were positive for cannabis and 168 ( 7.4% ) for opiates or benzodiazepines . This is an 80% increase in the percentage of inmates testing positive for opiates or benzodiazepines . Since provisional assault figures for 1995 for the pilot prisons also show a 20% increase in assaults over 1993-94 figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at best , MDT has zero effectiveness in countering addiction and disorder ; we do so implicitly hereafter . Discussion <p> Research has shown that starting to inject drugs inside prison is associated with longer sentences as well as with local and individual prison-related factors. ( 23 ) Certainly , the issue of drug use in prison can not be tackled in isolation . The World Health Organization ( 24 ) and the 1994/95 Report of the Director of Prison Healthcare ( 25 ) recommend that healthcare in prisons should , wherever possible , be equivalent to that outside . Because most injecting drug users enter the prison system ( 26 ) after remand for a drugs-related offence or for theft or prostitution to fund their habit , prisons provide a unique opportunity to target educational and drugs rehabilitation programmes towards them at a time of potential receptivity but also vulnerability from loss of self-esteem and inevitable stress . <p> A major part of the Prison Service 's strategy to reduce drug misuse in prison is the introduction of MDT to identify drug users , punish them and offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently unresourced , ( 27 ) to Scotland from February , 1996 . Our analysis of average costs raises questions about a policy which apparently is ineffective in terms of reducing addiction and assaults. ( 3 ) <p> We estimate that at any one time about 5% of the UK 's injecting drug users are in prison . This would suggest that a similar proportion of education , rehabilitation , and support resources should be available to the prisons , a far larger figure than is identifiable in current budgets . However , this investment would represent only between 35% and 50% of the costs of MDT , over half of which is incurred as extra days in prison for cannabis takers . The control initiative of MDT has not produced anticipated benefits. ( 3 ) A supportive drug substitution and rehabilitation programme would introduce immediate and longer-term benefits both for the prison and for the outside community in reduced recidivism . It is possible that loss of remission as the result of positive urine tests or refusal may reinforce the very reason for taking drugs -- escape from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place. ( 28 , 29 ) <p> Our costing of MDT does not include the hidden human cost of acquiring HIV or Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection by using contaminated injection equipment . We welcome , however , the recent availability of disinfection tablets in UK prisons . Existing drug rehabilitation schemes in prison are under-resourced , resulting in waiting lists in prisons with large numbers of injecting drug users , such as Saughton and Glenochil Prisons in Scotland. ( 30 ) Investment in , and priority for , MDT in England and Wales is unlikely to be matched immediately by parallel investment in drug rehabilitation programmes , despite the exhortation of a Parliamentary Select Committee . We argue that resources which are already available in the community outside should be redistributed on a direct apportionment basis to the prison medical services as part of a long-term initiative on prison healthcare , and we suggest a figure of 5% . The problem of drug use , and especially of injecting drug use , is a substantial and shared one for both the prison service and the populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both within and between these overlapping constituencies ; and should not overlook the long-term risks to health of even the shortest period of experimentation with shared injecting drug use . <p> The MDT programme alienates prisoners , ( 31 ) is prejudicial to voluntary anonymous studies ( 32 , 6 ) which , until now , have measured the prevalence and risks of injecting drug use in prisons and , as we show in this analysis , diverts scarce prison resources from preventive and rehabilitation programmes which are likely to benefit prisoners ' welfare , and the public 's health . There is no lack of willingness on part of prisons to tackle this issue sympathetically and professionally. ( 30 ) The strong geographical correlation between deprivation and injection drug use ( 11 ) can not be resolved by the prisons alone but concerns all society . <p>

During the study ( March-October 2007 ) , the atmospheric temperature ranged from 27.5C-32C ( high ) to 24C-26C ( low ) , and rainfall was variable ( mean 301 mm/mo , range 36-657 mm/mo ) . </p> Because rickettsial species broadly cross-react within groups ( 9 , 10 ) , paired serum samples were tested by using an IgG indirect immunofluorescence assay ( IFA ) and Rickettsia rickettsii and R. typhi antigens ( Focus Diagnostics , Cypress , CA , USA ) to identify infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TGR ) rickettsial infections . Serum samples reactive at a titer of 80 were considered potentially positive and were titered . </p> To identify scrub typhus ( ST ) infections , we tested paired serum samples using IgG ELISA as described ( 11 ) , except for use of recombinant antigens ( 0.2 g each of r56 Chimeric1 , Gilliam , and Kato strains ) to detect antibodies to Orientia tsutsugamushi . Comparative blind testing of 200 serum samples with an established ( pooled-antigen ) quantitative assay enabled validation ( 12 ) . </p> Acute rickettsioses ( SFGR , TGR , and ST ) required a ? 4-fold rise in specific IgG titer or its equivalent ; patients with equal SFGR and TGR convalescent-phase titers were SFGR/TGR group-indeterminate . IgG ( titer ? 160 ) in acutephase serum defined rickettsial exposure ( seroprevalence ) . Stata IC version 11.0 ( StataCorp LP , College Station , TX , USA ) was used for analyses . </p> We analyzed paired serum samples for rickettsioses for 883 ( 81.9% ) of 1,079 patients . Median acute-convalescent phase follow-up was 21 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without paired serum samples were comparable ( 8 ) . Acute rickettsioses were documented in 156 ( 17.7% ) patients ( Table 1 ) . The increase in convalescent-phase geometric mean titer was 14-fold ( 845 ) for SFGR , 17-fold ( 920 ) for TGR , and 11-fold ( 951 ) for SFGR/TGR rickettsiae . </p> Acute rickettsioses were found in 19.7% of patients ? 18 years of age and 10.5% of patients &lt;18 years of age ( p = 0.003 ) ; patients with rickettisoses were older than those without rickettsioses ( median age 34.5 vs. 28.0 years ; p = 0.005 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Among patients &lt;18 years of age , acute rickettsioses were more common in male than in female patients ( 14.6% vs. 5.8% ; p&lt;0.05 ) . Patients with acute ST alone were older than those with other rickettsioses and those without rickettsioses ( median 36.5 vs. 34.4 vs. 28.0 years ; p = 0.02 ) and more likely to report rice paddy exposure ( 44.4% vs. 15.1% vs. 9.3% ; p = 0.001 ) . More acute rickettsioses occurred during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other rickettsioses ) , whereas more nonrickettsial infections ( 67.0% ) occurred during the drier period of March-June ( p&lt;0.0001 ) ( Figure 2 ) . </p> Acute rickettsioses were clinically similar to each other and to nonrickettsial febrile illnesses , except for frequency of cough , oliguria , and conjunctival suffusion ( Table 1 ) . Except for a higher temperature with SFGR than with TGR infection ( mean 38.6 vs. 38.2C ; p = 0.006 ) , no feature differentiated these rickettsial infections . Conjunctival suffusion was more common ( p = 0.004 ) with ST ( 35.3% ) than with SFGR/TGR ( 12.8% ) or no rickettsiosis ( 12.8% ) . </p> Antecedent antimicrobial drug use was commonly reported in patients with ( 45/115 39.1% ) and without ( 195/536 36.4% ; p = 0.58 ) rickettsioses . Amoxicillin and cephalosporins were administered most frequently in both groups ( 16.8% and 20.3% ; p = 0.40 ) , but infrequent administration of doxycycline ( 0.9% and 1.1% ; p = 0.82 ) was recorded for 813 patients with paired serum samples , including 139 with acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3/139 , sensitivity 2.2% , 95% CI 0.447%-6.2% ) . Rickettsioses were also infrequently confirmed when diagnosed clinically ( 3 SFGR rickettsioses among 9 with suspected scrub typhus ; positive predictive value 33.3% , 95% CI 7.5- 70.1 ) and rarely treated appropriately ( 2/9 given doxycycline , 1 with SFGR rickettsiosis ) . Patients with rickettsioses were hospitalized longer than others ( median 5 vs. 4 days ; p = 0.01 ) , although the proportion hospitalized was similar . No one with confirmed rickettsioses died , but 11 of 12 patients died before follow-up . </p> At enrollment , 292 ( 33.1% ) patients had IgG-confirmed rickettsial exposure . However , only 59 ( 20.2% ) had a 4-fold increase in titer , and 97 ( 62.2% ) of 156 acute infections were identified as rickettsioses by seroconversion . Exposures to rodents and rice paddies were associated with TGR rickettsiae and O. tsutsugamushi IgG ( Table 2 ) . Farmers were more likely ( p = 0.01 ) to have IgG against O. tsutsugamushi ( 5.7% ) than SFGR/TGR rickettsiae IgG alone ( 4.3% ) or no rickettsial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at either sampling were used to denote rickettsial exposure ( preexisting or acute ) , 342 ( 38.7% ) patients had exposure to SFGR and/or TGR rickettsiae . If a lower titer ( ? 80 ) were used , 398 ( 45.1% ) had such exposure . Similarly , 121 ( 13.7% ) patients had either acute- or convalescent-phase IgG against O. tsutsugamushi . </p> Conclusions We documented endemic rickettsioses as a major cause of acute febrile illness in southern Sri Lanka . Epidemiologic features could not differentiate acute infection from prior exposure . Rickettsioses were infrequently suspected and not treated empirically when suspected . Underrecognition of rickettsioses could reflect nonspecific clinical features , limited diagnostic tools , lack of awareness that rickettsioses occur or cause severe illness , and absence of evidencebased local algorithms for acute febrile illness . </p> Studies in neighboring regions have used flawed methods , including spectrum bias , small sample size , selective enrollment , and testing acute-phase serum only . In many instances , clinical features were not predictive ( 5 , 13 ) ; however , older age was reported with rickettsioses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ST compared with TGR rickettsiosis ( 4 ) . Although part of the rickettsial triad , rash is often absent initially ( 10 ) and among unselected febrile patients ( 5 , 14 ) . SFGR/ TGR cross-reactions and apparent co-infections could also impair clinical differentiation of specific rickettsioses . Laboratory abnormalities associated with ST ( 3 ) could reflect disease severity , not etiology , and such testing is often unavailable . Divergent conclusions might reflect different study populations , diagnostic criteria , reference groups , features evaluated , or real geographic differences . </p> Our estimate of rickettsioses is conservative . Confirmation required follow-up ( return or home visit ) ; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention no longer accepts a single high titer to confirm R. rickettsii infection ( 10 ) . We required a 4-fold rise in titer even for seroconversions because IFA results are subjective , even among experts . We used R. rickettsii as a surrogate antigen , which could be less sensitive for detecting local SFGR . We chose ELISA for ST because a commercial IFA was not available and IFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . </p> Optimal clinical management of acute rickettsioses requires development of locally tested , evidence-based algorithms for acute febrile illness . Better diagnostic tests are needed to identify new species , elucidate vector-host relationships , and enable appropriate therapy . Molecular approaches hold promise but will require prospective validation . </p> Acknowledgments We thank the members of the microbiology laboratory at the Medical Faculty , University of Ruhuna , and the clinical staff at Teaching Hospital Karapitya for their assistance ; P.

@@4021041 Today I awoke in a hurry . I did everything in a dizzying hurry : I bathed , dressed , ate breakfast , everything in a hurry . And quickly , I finished reading Don Quixote and I began The Divine Comedy . <p> I attribute this urgency to the Quixote , and to the date . <p> Yesterday , the 31st of December , the last day of a year , should have been , to be fair , the day I finished the last page of a book . But I did n't . I read : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> I continued reading until a plump man sat across from me at my table . We looked at each other . Silence . <p> I lowered my eyes to read the first word of the following verse . The man pounded the table with his right hand , which I was forced to lift . <p> This happened fourteen consecutive times . <p> I have a certain affinity or a certain superstition about the number fourteen .

Farewell . <p> The sense of hurry , now nested in me , kept pushing me . I picked up The Divine Comedy . As if under a spell of vertigo , I arrived at the following passage : <p> Entrai per lo cammino alto e silvestro . <p> Now the sense of hurry forced me to leave the house . <p> I took the book with me . It 's a big , heavy , hard-back book with illustrations by Dor . <p> With my book and my shoes , I ran through the streets . <p> A plaza . On one side a sturdy grey-stone building dominated by a huge tower . At the bottom , a small door whose threshold gave way to a staircase of the same grey-stone . <p> An idea : climb this staircase to the top of the tower , and stare out at the city and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I began to do this . I began to climb . But at the twentieth stair , I stumbled ( what a beautiful word ! ) and The Divine Comedy fell from under my arms and rolled . <p> It rolled down the stairs . It came to the door , crossed the threshold , and tumbled through the plaza . It came to a stop near the center of the plaza , landed open on its back , wide open : page 152 , canto 23 . On one page , the text ; on the other , an illustration : between two steep and isolated cliffs , on smooth ground , a man of the earth , naked , on his back , arms spread , spread wide , feet together , crucified , there on the ground , on the smooth ground , between the isolated cliffs . <p> Dante and Virgil stared at this man . Beneath the illustration , the words : <p> Attraversato e nudo per la via , Come tu vedi , ed mestier ch'e ' senta Qualunque passa com'ei pesa pria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentlessly . The Divine Comedy got wet , and oozed . The words melted onto the stones of the pavement . I climbed down the stairs , arrived at the book , bent over , reached out a hand and picked it up , hooking my index finger and thumb around the leather spine . I tossed it towards myself . Now , Attention ! <p> Tenderly , slowly , I tossed it to myself . Arm , hand , and book began to shift with the slowness of a snail 's nightmare . <p> My arm folded across my body . My hand moved back , and dosed in . Its prey , the book , was also open . And with the book came the cliffs , the smooth ground , the two figures : Dante and Virgil . <p> Attention ! Two figures . Not three . Because the crucified man , eternally crucified , did not come with them . In spite of the three nails , he slid around the page ; more accurately , the page slid , the entire book slid out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped out of the base . His legs , his back , his crossed arms , his nape , hit the pavement with a loud thump . <p> The three nails sunk into his legs . <p> I walked back towards the door with The Divine Comedy , which was soaking wet , and missing one of its characters . <p> I looked : the good man was now growing , taking shape . A strong , muscular man , with a black beard and shaggy hair , naked , crucified , nailed to the ground in the middle of the plaza with rain pouring on him . <p> I returned to my house . <p> My sense of hurry disappeared . Now , as I write , I am calm . I am filled with an incomparable peace . February 1st <p> Today I have had an extraordinary experience . Here 's what happened : <p> But before I begin : my biggest joy is my magnificent tenor voice ; and yet , I do n't sing , and when I do sing I sing like a pig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered my living room , went to the mahogany cabinet , opened it , pulled out a file with some records , and then I took the needle from my phonograph . <p> I stood in the center of the room .

Then with my right hand , I positioned a record on my left index finger in such a way that its hole fit exactly over my nail . Ok . With this same right hand I began to quickly spin the record , skimming its side until it spun with astonishing speed . Then I picked up the needle and with my right hand -- arched and graceful like a swan 's neck -- I spun the first notes of the song . <p> And I opened my mouth . <p> I opened my mouth as wide as possible . <p> From my mouth , from my throat , from beneath my palate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , deafening , thundering through the empty space , the voice of Caruso wildly sang : <p> Di quella pira ! L'orrendo fuoco ! ! <p> An incredible moment ! <p> I repeated this experience . But with no results . I repeated this fourteen times . You already know what I think of the number fourteen . I did n't try , thus , a fifteenth time . Which is not to say that this was not a day worth living . March 1st <p> Today I have been mourning . A great old friend has died . He died sitting on the ground , his arms crossed over his contracted legs , in a pose between mummy and drinker of mat <p> When I arrived at his house , he was still alive . He sat in the aforementioned pose on the carpet of his living room . His entire family , his doctor , and various friends were with him , waiting . Everyone , naturally , was standing . <p> After a half hour of waiting , the doctor raised a hand , and whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to shiver , The doctor whispered : <p> -- The last breath . <p> The wife of the unfortunate man then appeared . She stood tall , calm , and impressive . <p> She gracefully lowered her head . Many tears fell from her eyes .

The moment he dies he will fall on his back . Collapsing on the carpet , plush as it is , must not be his first impression of death . Instead you must . Flesh upon flesh , my friend ! Death with life ! Jacket against jacket ! <p> I was scared .

And so I fled . <p> As I crossed the threshold , I heard an anguished cry and a muted thump : the cry of my friend 's unfortunate wife , and the sound of the soft carpet receiving the noble back , the noble head of he who was always the purest of men . April 1st <p> Today I took part in my irreplaceable friend 's funeral. ( n1 ) <p> As I sat in my room weeping , the first stratum of my brain , the one next to the cranium , thought of how life without my friend would be a perpetual disappointment ; meanwhile , the interior stratum thought of how these tears , once dried and solidified , would , if ingested with wine , undoubtedly produce a substance that would make me think that the death of my unforgettable and exemplary friend was of little importance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somber chords of Chopin 's funeral march . I said : <p> -- Here comes the funeral procession ! <p> And I ran like a madman to join it . But I did not arrive at my destination . For the windows of my house , in the colonial fashion , have thick iron bars ; I collided with one of them like a butterfly , like an insect with the radiator of a speeding car . <p> The door ? Why did I not use the door ? <p> My dear and old friends , you who are alive , if I knew why I ran to the window and not the door , you can be sure that at this moment I would not be writing , instead I would be relaxing , smoking in peace and not thinking about my dead friend , about you , or even about myself . <p> But I do n't know why I ran to the window . <p> From between the bars , I looked down at the procession . <p> At that moment , the cavalrymen passed by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They blanketed the buildings ; they blanketed the sky . They marched in perfect formation , each with a wiry smile , ( n2 ) slicked back hair , an astrakhan hat over the right ear . Each rode a big black horse . But as they passed , they got smaller . <p> I could now see the sky . I could now see the buildings across the street . I could see them in their entirety . Now I was forced to look down , at the pavement , to see the strapping cavalrymen . <p> Until the last one passed ; he was as big as a mouse . <p> The hearse then appeared ; it was small , tiny , balancing like a ship in a tempest each time it crossed the groove between two cobblestones . And his relatives who walked on both sides of the car were like ants , like teeny , weeny ants . <p> My unforgettable friend ! May 1st <p> Today I crossed the threshold of my library . I had not been in it , not even once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . It was filled with a dim light that had darkened over time . An insect buzzed around the lamp , seventeen years ! And on my work table , the Songs of Maldaror by the Comte de Lautremont . <p> I was overcome with emotion as I once again saw my bookshelf . It gave off a tepid warmth . Fading print clung to the cover of each book . Silence . <p> Silence , yes . And soon my ears , adapting to the silence , heard a trivial , trifling murmur ; a murmur of piercing insignificance , an almost microscopic , yet implacable murmur . <p> I immediately understood what was happening . <p> Those vermin-bibliophiles , whose names I will ignore , those vermin who make their bread from abandoned libraries , were feeding on the words of the thousands of authors that silently formed on my bookshelf so that I -- whenever the Spirit moved me -- could release them from their silence and make them speak once again to my ears . <p> I opened the book by Lautremont and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one vermin , no more than one .

This is the story that had taken place when it was alive : <p> It began with the opening of an orifice in the back cover of the book , just in front of the space occupied by the last letter of the last word of the last line of the last song , which ends : <p> It is nevertheless true that the crescent-moon shaped garments no longer take the expression of their definitive symmetry from the quaternary number : go and see for yourself , if you do not believe me . <p> The vermin had perforated the last e in " believe me .

He continued in an oblique route up a slanting , inclined plane , treading softly , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel of paper and ink , in pursuit of the first letter of the first word of the first line of the first song , which begins : <p> May it please heaven that the reader , emboldened and having for the time being become as fierce as what he is reading , should , without being led astray , find his rugged and treacherous way across the desolate swamps of these sombre and poison-filled pages ; <p> Here , the little beast perforated the first M. <p> And since the book was open , the little beast finally saw , after months , perhaps after years of grief and shadows , of the howls and curses of Maldoror , it saw once again the filtered light of my silent library . <p> It had worked its way through those 280 pages of " poisoned swamps " with a " wild and rugged " desolation and had received in its sleeping little body -- like a new Christ for our modern day brothers -- as much as a man can suffer trying to rebel and fight . <p> Noble little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see hope : in the second song , as it traveled through each page of the hymn to the louse .

Wait a moment and I will tell you : it is because they do not have the strength . You may be sure that if their jaws conformed to the measure of their infinite desires , your brain , the retina of your eyes , your spinal column and all your body would be consumed . Like a drop of water . <p> at that moment the little beast , from its dark prison , sent its " infinite prayers " of infinite honor up to Lautremont . <p> Everything else it experienced on its journey was exceedingly cruel . As soon as it completed its grueling work it started to run . <p> It fell from the book to the table . It kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on imploding , its microscopic soul was taken to the Great Almighty . <p> Noble little beast ! <p> Today , I gave it a dignified burial beneath The Song of Songs . June 1st <p> Today I experienced one fury after another , bouncing back and forth between furies , one fury , a second , a third , and so on . <p> First : <p> I left the house . A group of ragged old ladies were standing in line in front of the School of Advanced Polytechnic Studies . Certainly they were waiting for something , but what could eleven old ladies be waiting for at the School of Advanced Polytechnic Studies ? <p> This question hit me like a projectile : What could they be waiting for ? And that was sufficient : the fury dominated me . <p> I walked through the streets and passed the school : 1 ) enjoying all the privileges of freedom provided to each honest citizen of a model Republic ; and 2 ) in full enjoyment of my freedom from the moment I awoke ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , after walking only one hundred meters , eleven old ladies nailed me to the sidewalk , keeping me from advancing and denying me my republican liberties ; and then one question appeared before me , and called into question an assumption I had held for forty years : that I am a free man who only asks questions that he , and not others , wants to ask . <p> What could eleven ragged old ladies be waiting for at the School of Advanced Polytechnic Studies ? First fury . It took a tremendous effort to move my feet from the concrete and continue my walk . <p> Second : <p> I moved my feet and walked . Alone . The pedestrians I passed slipped off me like ice . Alone , moreover , with my first fury . And a man alone with his fury is a danger . yes , a danger . but to himself , not to his fury . <p> I walked , then , to the house where my friends live . <p> The house has nine floors . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives one of my friends . In total : nine ascending friends : on the first floor lives a great friend ; but on the second floor is an even greater friend ; and on the third floor , even greater . Thus , as the floors rise , so does the level of friendship , until the ninth floor . <p> When there is absolute peace in my spirit , when not even a swelling can be perceived , I visit my friends on the first and second floors . And when some passion begins to stir in me , I climb the stairs in exact proportion to the potency of that passion . I rarely visit my dear friend on the ninth floor . But when I do visit him , our friendship extends , and explodes , like a powerful bomb . <p> After the eleven old ladies , I arrived at the threshold of the door of the house where my nine friends live . Calculations made and furies weighed , I decided to bypass the first , the second , the third , the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cordial greetings . Then I explained to my great friend what had brought me to his house . He listened attentively . Finally , he said : <p> What a beautiful morning ! Go out on the balcony . No discussion . Although you have walked quite a bit in search of peace , it is not the same , I assure you , as searching for peace while standing still . <p> I went out on the balcony . A beautiful morning , indeed . The beginning of winter . Cool air . And radiant sunshine . <p> Yes , sun , so much sun . Which is why below , on the streets and on the sidewalks , each man who passed dragged along his shadow . <p> Second fury : <p> Irremediably , a shadow for each man . Irremediably , a perfect imitation in the shadow of each movement of each man . <p> Fury . I will explain . I will explain the key to why this fury -- of the shadows -- attached itself to the other fury -- the old ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation for why the second fury remained atop and separate from the first fury , which was able to maintain its own force and presence , just as the second fury maintained its own presence . A double weight , a double anger . Now let us distinguish between them : <p> In the first case the old ladies were the pretext that inflamed my fury . But my complete fury relapsed , and the old ladies , somehow or another , remained outside of it . <p> My fury , perhaps , encircled me , without penetrating me , and I stayed within its sphere , free , calm , ignoring it the way one ignores the air one breathes . <p> The fury then collided with the eleven old ladies , and materialized in the form of an interrogation . It bounced off them . It became empowered within me because the interrogation enveloped me , squeezed the life out of me and asked me how it is possible that a sovereign man can be stopped by the first contradiction he finds on the street : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide door of the School of Advanced Polytechnic Studies . <p> The fury raged against me , a sovereign forty-year-old man . <p> But in the second case it is completely different . What fury could have affected me , isolated and unattached as I was on the balcony on this radiant morning ? But I have an anger , a deadly hatred , of all the men who pass on the sidewalk , who walk from the shady side of the street to the sunny side of the street . <p> They walk past . They pass from shadow to light , from light to shadow . Like a spout of water that splashes feet , they spread a dark appendage against the luminous ground . They enter the shade : their feet suck up the appendage , which loses itself in the legs and disappears . This happens to every one , every single one . <p> I look at their faces . I have a small hope : that in at least a few of them , in two or three , there will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as their unraveling is sucked up by the shadow . Nothing ! <p> They are preoccupied by everything , everything alters their physiognomy : another pedestrian , a car , a tram , a woman in her window , the newspaper , a cigarette , a dog in the street . Everything , except that which they spread against the ground , which they themselves absorb with their entire body . Which is why this , amid so much else , remains inexorable : shadow in the sun , no shadow in the shadow . <p> They walk past . From all sides , in all directions . Their physiognomy changes at the site of a fly lost between cars and streetlights . <p> But nothing changes in the face of the inexorable . Not one gesture , not one little scowl . Cowardly men ! <p> If , at the very least , one , only one man stood today in the center of the street , and protested at the top of his voice , his fists raised towards the sky , protested the unraveling of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouette is not drawn resplendently in the shadowy pavement . But nothing ! <p> Cowardly men ! <p> I lash out at them with my mortal anger . Not at myself , a pure man , elevated in the frame of a friend 's balcony . <p> Earlier against myself , now against the others . That is why the two furies are superimposed , each with its own force . A double anger ! <p> And now , slowly , an old Victoria goes by at a short trot , with its old coachman , and in the front an old horse . And the three of them , coachman , coach , and horse , project upon the gold of the pavement three old and bluish dodderers who quiver with each slow trot . <p> The fifth friend on the fifth floor can not calm my rage . <p> I say good-bye . I continue climbing the stairs . I ring the doorbell of my ninth friend on the ninth floor . Onward ! <p> Third : <p> My friend does n't say a word to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I go there : the beginning of winter , cool air and sunshine . <p> I do not look once more at the streets . I look forward , at another house , as large as the one I am in now . Windows and more windows . Through those windows I spy into the life of the other house . <p> Third . <p> That house across the street . As soon as I saw it , an idea consumed me , detonated within me : the idea of : " a whole " In this whole there were no parts , or if they existed , they were secondary . Floors , windows , walls , etc. . secondary . One house , one totality , one being . The house in front of me , fixed in a spot in the city , in the world . One house , an indivisible house . All of it following one destiny , to its proper and definitive end -- which is , exactly , its destiny . Like my own destiny -- the course of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if my right hand has a different destiny than my left , this difference is also part of one indivisible , unique destiny : mine . <p> In the house across from me , the same thing . <p> And for those who live in the house , the same . Because they belong to the house , the house includes them , and if any of them try to claim , all the same , their own existence , the totality always takes precedence : the house . <p> From across the street , I stand on my own . My destiny , my fate , is something else . I stand outside of that life current . I look on , alone and distant . <p> On one floor , merchants hard at work unfold and balance silks for a woman who touches and smells them . On a higher floor , several typists . Above them , exactly at my level , a family has breakfast : a man , a fat woman , a girl , and a little boy . And above them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of an old man appears behind the glass and against the frame ; sometimes I see his eyeglasses ; less frequently , I see his white mustache , but always -- every half minute -- his bald head freezes for an instant , turns , and disappears into the ashes of his home . <p> A totality : the house , the destiny of the house with its globules . <p> Me : a different destiny , a different fate . <p> Thus : <p> Third fury : <p> I could see what they were doing . Yet they could not see amongst themselves . <p> The first was directed at me . The second was directed at others . Now this fury was directed at God . <p> And now I , on my ninth friend 's balcony and across the street from the neighbors , performed , in miniature , like a louse , the role of looking into a world -- though it was only a small part of a house -- and seeing what those within that world saw only in sections . A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the half minutes ! The moment , for example , when , approaching the window , he pressed his white mustache against the frame . <p> At that very same moment , the man on the floor beneath him coughed , and one of the typists on the lower floor swiftly flipped back her golden hair . So what ? <p> Something , something large : <p> I thought of the last century of the human era . I then multiplied all the successive events that could occur , and I launched them beyond the earth , to the planets , to the entire cosmos , to measure them at the same time . An enormity of actions in an immensity of time . <p> But however enormous the actions , and however immense the time , the smallest , most miniscule actions are never , ever , in their fleeting , colorless moments , understood by those who take part in them . The actors never understand . But I do . <p> The old man never knew , never knew that at the moment his mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own totality , had released a cough into the air . And the man who coughed could not know -- however much actions and times are exaggerated -- that his cough occurred at the exact same moment when a woman flipped back her frothy golden hair . <p> This coincidence passed like a needle through these three points of action , forming a line which linked together these actions in one common and isolated instance , a line that will forever be ignored , even if we extend time and events beyond all possible calculations . <p> And I will understand this throughout the course of my own proper eternity . <p> At that moment the lady who touched and smelled the silks was standing still . If she had spoken , or lifted an orange silk , or if she had collapsed into an inanimate state , I would have known . <p> But the old man , never . Never would he know that his white mustache , which touched the wooden walls of the window frame , was in the same line of events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the silks . <p> But yes , I would know . <p> The woman could have died . Her soul , carrying its virtues and sins , could have flown off to the throne of the Supreme Creator , to become undone , and to be seen and judged . Moreover , it could or could not have been that soul 's destiny , to continue -- its spirit traveling , suffering -- ignorant that its undoing was in the same line of coincidence as the woman flipping her golden hair , as the man 's jolting cough , as the mustache of the old man pointing towards the street like the teeth of a furious dog . <p> She is ignorant . I am not . <p> Something , yes , something large . It is something large to have had a bit -- as small as it may have been -- of God 's vision of four people in one house in one instant who were " one " and who did not know of their union , and never would know . <p> It went against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only for an instant , and even though it kept in check the minuscule nature of my existence -- that I played a small part in His experience . But I want to continue in my role ; I want to continue , without distractions or illusions , to be a human worm who slithers along , and who , when he senses his own helplessness , openly cries to the fires of Hell . <p> Not even my ninth friend could return peace to my spirit . <p> Nine floors in the opposite direction . Streets , long strides . A search for peace down another path . July 1st <p> Today I wandered aimlessly . Behind me , at each step , the finger of God . I have felt it at every moment . Twice it stuck into my neck . <p> He did this lightly , as if mistakenly . Like a glimpse of a glimpse , entwining me in my own ideas about his identity . <p> This is what happened : <p> I was walking along a busy central boulevard . Suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collided . Commotion , vociferations , and so on . Two men slapped each other . Injuries , one death , Public Assistants , police officers . For a moment I thought this was going to change the direction of the entire city , and thus the entire nation . But in one minute , perhaps less , everything was calm . The disturbance disappeared like a magic trick : arguments , police officers , Public Assistants , curious bystanders , everything . The boulevard 's normal circulation returned without absorbing even a trace of what had occurred . <p> And just as the street had returned to its normal appearance , Estanislao Brun , walking in long , loud strides , appeared at one corner , with his little gold glasses and his curved back and his briefcase of stocks and bonds tucked beneath his arm . And he walked past . <p> He walked past -- what ! -- and then walked over , trampling , clicking his heels , on the very site , the exact spot where , only seconds earlier , the two vehicles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries had occurred , where someone had died , and where the public order had dissolved . And he walked past , I repeat , that same spot , step by step , without noticing a thing , without smelling a thing , practically erasing the existence of the accident , an unlikely being coasting along , one millimeter from , a half millimeter from a sensational act , which he had no idea about , and which he never would know about . <p> For twenty minutes I stood still on the corner without understanding , or , more accurately , understanding as absurdity these paths of destiny , these winding threads that intertwine but never make contact , each one lost in its own world of ignorance , side by side , in a world of not-knowing . <p> I continued to wander around . Now I am walking down a quiet street , with little gardens on one side , small residential houses on the other . One of these houses : a friend 's house , an acquaintance , really , whose name I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perfectly unfriendly , and because I consider him to be one of the most illustrious examples of our imbecility . <p> It is 3:32 in the afternoon . The upstairs windows of his study are closed , the downstairs windows are open . An unmistakable sign that the man in question is inside . Moreover , there are other signs that he is there . There can be no doubt that he is inside . <p> Ok . This character wants to see me , needs to see me , my presence or absence could alter , for better or worse , his destiny . But various circumstances ( about which I must keep quiet ) oblige us to meet each other by mere chance , and nothing else . There is no room for any other option . <p> In summary : he is inside ; I am on the street , walking . <p> I walk past his house , slowly . <p> I am his destiny , a possible change in his destiny that he desires and needs . <p> It is exactly 3:33 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man is submerged in his old parchment papers . I walk past . <p> I pass , and move away from the house . Now I am outside of , and far from , his orbit . <p> He has no idea what slow , parallel thread of destiny just passed him , one step forward , would have entwined the various lines that have twisted through his existence . <p> He has no idea . None ! Not even the slightest vibration on one page of his old parchment papers . Not even an inopportune insect that causes him , exactly at 3:33 , to break from his work and make a different gesture . Nothing ! <p> I pass his house , with the finger of God on my neck , pushing me forward . <p> Twice the finger of God . The effect : exhaustion , fatigue . <p> But in the evening , this evening , a distraction will come , a rest . The cynic of Valdepinos will have dinner with my brother Pedro and myself . Cynical he may be , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries , and brings peace . <p> At exactly nine on the dot the tall figure of the cynic of Valdepinos came to the door . <p> Before I continue : <p> There are two things , two entities which should always be united , or which -- to state it better -- should have always remained united . Alas , destiny has thrown them from one side of the Earth to the other and does not allow them to be together , for one of them is in the beautiful country of Chile , while the other can not find a way of leaving the sweet land of France : the cynic of Valdepinos is here ; Pernod , is there . <p> But this is in principle , as if someone declared it " the Law " In reality , in a loose and dying reality , life does not always follow the rule of law : some time ago , a friend who lives in Paris sent me two bottles of Pernod . <p> The first one was finished months ago , but the second has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its contents ( I keep half of its contents hidden ) . A half which must be defended , like the land of honor , drop by drop ! As if the bottle 's final drop will be the last to ever spill in the history of Chile . <p> The cynic of Valdepinos eats and talks . Behind him , a cabinet which hides in one of its compartments the final half liter : thick , silent , like opal . If the cynic of Valdepinos knew ! <p> We eat , we talk . But from time to time I sense something uncomfortable passing above our plates . <p> Pedro is struck by a memory : in the same cabinet , near the back , he once stored an aged bottle of red wine . He gets up in a storm , opens the cabinet , sticks his hand in and pulls it out : he holds between his fingers the bottle of Pernod . <p> Pedro , with his unbearable indiscretion , with his unforgivable absentmindedness , lifts the bottle into the air and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places it with the same storminess on top of the cabinet , behind the head of our great and cynical friend . <p> There is the cynic ; I am facing him . The outline of his pointy , suspicious , bird-face , his newly balding head . Above his head , crowning it , like another bird perched on the head of the cynic , the Pernod . <p> And the cynic of Valdepinos swallows and talks , indifferent and undisturbed as he tells the story of a hysterical old woman we all know . <p> Twenty-four seconds ! Pedro looks for his bottle of red wine , he finds it , holds it , feels it . Twenty-four seconds ! <p> He stretches out his hand , grabs the Pernod . The Pernod disappears . He closes the cabinet . Good Lord ! For twenty-four seconds -- I repeat -- the cynic 's most cherished pleasure sat above and behind him . A shift of the eyes , and we would have drunk it to the last drop , and our ideas would have been different , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In any case , this is certainly true for the cynic of Valdepinos . <p> But he had no idea . He did n't even suspect that for almost half a minute the sweet antidote to his Parisian nostalgia was ten or fifteen centimeters behind his head . <p> At this moment he is probably walking in solitary strides through a dark street . Poor Valdepinos ! <p> As for me , I have returned to the seat I occupied during the meal . I have taken out the bottle of Pernod and returned it to where Pedro thoughtlessly left it . <p> The bottle of Pernod had been for the cynic of Valdepinos what I had been for the old man of the parchment papers . And the cynic of Valdepinos , moreover , had been for the bottle of Pernod what Estanislao Brun had been for the accident on the boulevard . <p> Nobody -- neither man nor bottle -- knew anything . <p> Except me . <p> Thus today , once again , I have gone against God . August 1st <p> Today I lived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Very early in the morning , the writer Csar Mir appeared in my study . He took a seat . And remained silent . Finally , he told me the following : <p> He had woken up in a good mood . He had jumped out of bed full of optimism . He had sat on the balcony , where his sense of happiness and optimism grew stronger : in the middle of the Plaza de Armas , he had seen his " Man dressed in green " speaking in a powerful voice , surrounded by public interest and enthusiasm . A good start to the day ! Then he went back to bed and read the newspaper . <p> This was his happy moment and , through friendship , mine . But let 's continue : <p> Mir lies peacefully once more in his bed with two arms at his side . Between them , the newspaper , spread open , and waiting to be read . But this is no time to read . He thinks about the spectacle in the plaza . Yes , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper release a murmur , as if from the universe , which buzzes around the ears . He has to read . Mir lifts the newspaper up to his eyes , leaving it perpendicular to the surface of his still waters : his bed , his body , the floor , and the earth . He lifts the paper abruptly . He holds the paper , and looks at it . And here begins the second moment , the moment of grave concern : <p> As soon as he lifted the newspaper and brought it to the perpendicular position , every letter of every word on the first page , every one , without exception , came loose , detached itself from the newspaper , and fell with the quivering sound of a bell . <p> My dear friend ! Alone in his room with a blank page before his eyes . My dear friend ! Covered with thousands and thousands of meaningless , scattered letters . <p> And now the arduous task of putting them back in place , thousands and thousands of letters , one after another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners of the world . <p> He picks up two I 's , which must , without a doubt , belong to the words HIS HIGHNESS , who just got married . Progress ! But they might also belong to RIBERI , who committed suicide . <p> He picks up an H and he picks up an E. There is not a newspaper that does not print each day on its front page the words His Excellence , which is abbreviated with the letters H. E. He continues , in this manner , down a safe path . But a doubt appears in his mind ; has he made a profound error , for the H may have referred to the Holy sites that were desecrated last night ; and the E could have referred to the Employers who on each continent quietly oppress their workers . <p> What difficult work : so fraught with dangers this interminable task of adjusting each fallen letter to recreate the word that brought them to life . <p> Better to abandon this mess and seek the advice of a friend . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step a letter untangles from his clothes . By my shoes there is an F ; a T hangs from the bars on the window ; an O bounces off the floor , rolls around and collides with an insect calmly bathing in the triangle of sun that visits my study at 9 o'clock each morning . <p> I can not find any advice to give him . <p> He leaves my house . <p> As he crosses the threshold , he drops a lower-case i , a pathetic i from some lost word that at one moment had an actual meaning . There it stands , erect , balancing its little dot . <p> As long as I shall live in this house , I will take care to not step on this i . And I will always turn to salute it . And it will stay in my doorway , like a guard who keeps my domestic worries from leaving the house , and who keeps the outside world from entering . September 1st <p> Today I have come to the coast . So many of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the city and search for equilibrium by the ocean . <p> I have sat on some rocks : the waves at my feet , and all that the poets sing of . <p> I have watched one of these waves for a period of an hour or more . It inflated , slipped , exploded , and dissolved . But the way it returned , always in the same form , it was always the same , throughout the entire hour or more , throughout all of the past , and most likely into the future as well . <p> Having made this discovery , and with an unshakable faith in it , I set out to ponder other thoughts , but before doing so I measured , and precisely demarcated the size of the unique wave , as we so spontaneously do in order to continue our meditations , in front of a tree , an animal , a colleague , or whatever thing that comes before our eyes and asks to be understood . <p> On this task I spent more than an hour , perhaps two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not measure or demarcate anything . Because : <p> The wave comes in hidden beneath its own spine . It comes in with a long and sordid convulsion . Without a doubt , it hides its head , it sinks its head downwards , not wanting to expose itself to the breeze , to the sun , to the sky and the birds . It thinks only of the ocean 's depths . And I only see the pain of its uncovered spine . <p> That was it . There was a vast pain in front of my eyes . But I could not clearly see a definite body to measure . This pain would stay in darkness , in smoke , disorienting spectators across the world . <p> The wave . The wave is one , one solitary entity . It is one , absolute in its existence . This solitary entity is what suffers . It does n't matter that it dissolves . It remakes itself . It remakes itself thousands of times because its pain continues . <p> Fine . But let 's rigorously demarcate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickens , and howls . <p> Now it twists , edges into white , curves , thunders . Thousands of specks of foam jump . The flowers behind it tremble . The sun in front of it shivers . A man stops . A dog barks . White specks jump across the entire sky . And at my side , here at my feet , in a narrow ridge of wet rocks , a trail of water , agile as a lizard , moves slowly , climbing , licking . It stops , and returns , snaps towards the solitary wave . <p> We measure . <p> The solitary wave , like an octopus , has extended its tentacles . One of those tentacles has come all the way to me . This sibilant water is always the wave ; it is within its limits and demarcation . Proof of this is that it re-gathers near the body . <p> Once more it stretches . Better said , it stretches out a tentacle . It comes . Sprinkles . It stops three meters from my post . It reaches a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feels , pokes . It must pick up grains of salty , violet patina . It must feel a sweet , velvety pleasure as it pricks the moist and perfumed puddle with its tip . <p> The puddle has two concavities . The first one is big , the second one is smaller . Both are practically circular . They nearly form a stretched out 8 , the bottom pointing towards the sea ; the head towards the mountains . <p> The water rolls around inside . It dives into the first section , it searches every nook , it explores every last crack . It touches the joining neck . It examines the neck , quickly , and with certainty . It continues . It springs forward . It fills the second concavity . The solitary wave , submerged now in the ocean , experiences a healthy , salty pleasure , a pleasure repeated a thousand times throughout this vast camp of rocks and crossroads . <p> Fine . I am only responsible for this final bit that 's next to me . <p> The water inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small concavity is looking for an entry into the larger one . Once more it stirs around . Each drop of water wants to be the first to pass into the neck . No drop wants to remain still during the interval between the two movements . The entire small puddle fights , moves , intensifies , cries out for the vast sea from which it came . This homesick water completely enters the blue line of the deep horizon . <p> And I , from my post , observe the limited and disturbed life of the water in the second puddle . <p> It lives . It completes its task . It arrives , takes off , arrives . As I have said : homesick . <p> Therefore , it is not the wave . It is a separate entity , an independent unity . Thus ? <p> The end of the large monster has to be marked as the neck of the 8 . Its head , which looks out at the mountains , has become independent , has individualized . Throughout all of this immense being lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which conquers the personality , and sharpens its instincts , if only in between rocks . <p> To measure the neck . But the body of the 8 lives the same life . The same phases , the same tragedy . And not only is there a similarity between the entire stream of water and a lizard : but there is as much life here as in the lizard as well . <p> Ok , then . I followed that trail until it finally fell into the ocean . <p> I glanced at the front of the wave at the moment it broke . A few minutes of contemplating the small puddle completely changed the panorama of the waters . <p> Each section of the waters , each piece in the wave , lived on its own . There was an isolated being in each section covered by my eyes , in each focal point , with its own purpose and passions , in the midst of millions of others , running along a parallel destiny . parallel , but nothing more . Thus the solitary wave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist . It stood alone as an aggregate of different destinies bound together by a supreme design : an immaterial design with no body , with no head , no submerged head , no painful spine brushing the air . <p> The solitary wave was nothing more than a collective movement . A movement , a purpose , an abstraction . <p> Living as matter , as body , as nerves , with each circle drawn individually over the whole by the rays of my eyes . Like the spout that shoots white foam straight up to the sky , where it splits into fireworks . Here in my vision there has been no focal point ; I have followed from bottom to top , and sung like a bird . And precisely above , where both water and vision have come to a halt , hundreds of points of water in hundreds of directions have at the same time individualized , and they have created , in the long meters of water , their global destiny , which bends them . <p> I can do nothing but stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living reality , like me , and like all the isolated men and beasts who live and suffer , alone , with one destiny and only one world inside their body . Nothing but these drops , nothing else , because my eyes are not made to divide the world beyond . <p> My eyes stop there . There I stop . Until I begin again -- drops of water , solitary wave , puddles , foam -- leaning over the silence of a microscope . Better to continue inversely . Measure on a large scale , sliding over the enormous spine . <p> That 's how I have done it . <p> I have proceeded like a tube opened at each end which has spread to the infinity of the ocean . No more small individual beings pulsing in a common movement : now , moving parts , members , from one larger being which grows , becomes giant as my imagination navigates above the horizon . But I have not focused my eyes on any one part so as not to awaken and make dance the millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they came into my sight . <p> I have stayed well away from it , to the point where I have been forced to look at the sky : five wild ducks fly past in a triangle . <p> It is preferable to come to terms with ducks -- even if there are five of them -- than with raging waves . Man occupies in size , more or less , the midpoint between an atom and a star ; therefore we are more or less the same in relation to the infinitely large or the infinitely small . But in size , and in all other ways , we are much closer to the duck than to the ocean . Therefore , there is no reason to take a position in relation to the latter when the former passes before your eyes . <p> Proof of this is that if a pain were to come from the ducks -- as it comes from the waters -- my size could right away verify the size and location of the one who feels it . The duck ! There it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying duck . Each flap of its wings strikes me . But with him are four other ducks . I bring them together in my line of vision . My focal point is not one , but rather the triangle that cuts through the air . The life of each duck fades into the life of the triangle . And if I could place myself above , high above , so that I could see hundreds of groups of ducks flying and evolving , each small triangle would also fade with life and everything else , and the collection of all the ducks would look uniquely alive and vital , a unified beast , a unified life and purpose . And each group -- which is to say , each bird ! -- one member , one pulsing cell , like the globules in our blood and in our entire body . <p> Higher ! We must always elevate ourselves more ! <p> All of these slippery stains formed beneath us by tiny black points , they are no longer the enormous solitary beast , but rather they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of coast and sea -- the region beneath my eyes -- pulsating , feeling , boiling . <p> And even higher ? Perhaps the entire Earth would appear as one living reality . And my duck ? <p> It passes by . There it goes . But it has dissolved between my fingers . <p> I have now started to jump along the rocks . As I move I am trying once again not to fix my eyes on anything so that the world will not multiply or increasingly unify . I have moved nervously through all that surrounds me , especially the ducks who I knew were passing above my head . I have gone on , feeling the urgent need to peacefully meditate on oceans , waves , puddles , and ducks , and to be able through my meditations to focus clearly on the point from where each independent life originates , or to discover that there is no such point . <p> Fine . Here in this cove there is peace . Sit , and let 's meditate . No more than a meter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the same plump man who interrogated me with his eyes when I had tried to read the Quixote . <p> I will explain everything to him . <p> -- Sir . ( In a circular instance I explain to him all that I had contemplated ) . <p> I skip over a moment full of dubious rocks . <p> -- Sir . ( And at this point , as my meditations had already been verified , I tell him with a richness of detail and elegance without par , the results I had obtained . The plump man warmly congratulates me . ) <p> Yes , but there is the moment on the rocks : an obligatory moment in the story . The first part is a direct observation of nature ; the other , a silent meditation . And between the two , their union , a conduit that unifies them : the moment the observation asked to be meditated upon . <p> This moment -- which in reality was accompanied by jumps on the rocks-I have to mention it to my audience . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> -- Sir , then . ( There has to be a " then . " How can it be avoided ? ) Then . I began to meditate. then . I thought . <p> No . It 's best not to meditate or think if to do so we have to go through this . <p> Let 's change the " then ; " this could be the cause of it all . <p> -- In the presence of this scene , sir . I could not keep myself from saying . I reflected in this way . and pondered as such . <p> Worse , worse . It looks like the problem is not in the " then " nor in the " in the presence of the scene : ' Could it be in the meditate , think , say , reflect , ponder ? <p> The gap between the two moments bristled the rocks . It 's like a tax that must be paid in order to obtain the necessary permission to elucidate our lucubrations . If there is something clear to extract from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive . Bad , bad ! Is there not some other way , a hidden path , a detour that evades the rocks ? An obligation to pay our old friend " literature " with a little phrase entirely to her liking ? <p> I am creating it ; better said , I continue to create it . Because I created it , to be sure , in the peaceful cove . I created it and , in the presence of this creation , I did not meditate at all , not even a hundredth of a meditation , not on oceans , nor on waves , nor on puddles , nor ducks , nor on lives as large as constellations or as small as microbes . October 1st <p> Today I returned to the edge of the sea . I have discovered a wonderful place . To get an idea of it , imagine a rock in the form of a monolith some 30-35 meters high ; place it with the waves , in such a way that they smack its base ; tint with blue sky all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal size and form ; put it next to the first rock , with no more than two or three meters between them ; proceed with this rock in the same way with respect to the waves and sky ; cover the space between the two rocks with sand and seashells ; sit sea birds at the top of the rocks ; throw crabs and mussels at the bottom ; surround the rocks with luche and cochayuyo leaves ; heat the rocks in the sun and meditate upon the whole scene , enraptured in admiration . <p> This is what I have done from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 5:10 . At this time , I was struck by a sudden desire : to go between the two tall monoliths , to enter the sea . Five minutes of reflection , and forward ! <p> Nothing interesting about my walk ; nothing as well as I passed between the two rocks ; but one small interesting detail as I attempted to enter the sea . Here it is : <p> As I stretched out my foot to kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the water retreated and my foot struck dry ground . Another step : the same thing . And another : the same . After seven steps , I stood still , hoping that a wave would once again emerge out of the undercurrent of the previous wave . I saw it form in the distance , I saw it come . As it came , I took another step and the same scene repeated itself . Ninth step , tenth . the same thing . Before the thirteenth attempt , I once again stood still . I only had one step left . You already know my feelings about the number 14 . <p> Another wave came , the last ! I burned my last step . The wave trickled away and once more I struck dry land . <p> Thus , with no more steps left , I buried myself up to my knees in the sand , and waited . <p> One minute , two minutes , three , four . Fourteen minutes , 14 ! <p> I heard in the air a solemn canticle : trumpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a banjo . And the sea like me stood still during those fourteen minutes , and when it heard the canticle , it awoke and rolled away . <p> From each side , from all four cardinal points , it moved entirely towards one point on the horizon , before my eyes . And as it moved , it discovered , in my presence , its wet and scented hidden depths . <p> Watery plants with branches like the tongues of monsters stretched forward and then , when they could no longer feel the soft pressure of the sea , they exploded in aromas of iodine and salt . Thousands of creatures like spiders and as big as dogs went wild , running , smashing , and , as they discovered that there was no remedy to cure this illness , they buried their heads in the rocks and died a sweet death . Millions of fish rolled their astonished eyes ; they emitted a groan , and dissolved into gelatin . And the underwater rocks , suddenly finding themselves naked in the sun , sunk into the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the entire sea , from all sides -- I repeat -- continued to escape towards that one point , forming , as it traveled , an immense globe of water . <p> A pause . All the plants had exploded , all the creatures had died , all the fish had turned into a gelatin ; not even a stone beneath the sun . <p> Then the sea transformed its sphere over the horizon into a curtain that covered the sky and hid the light . <p> Another pause . The curtain moved up and towards the coast . What a spectacular sight ! <p> I think it 's difficult for anyone to imagine this without having seen it with their own eyes . A sea , an ocean in place of the sky , ripples of foam in place of clouds , and a few displaced fish instead of seagulls and gannets . A spectacular sight ! Beneath it , I was in ecstasy . The mussels swiftly opened and closed their shells , applauding like castanets ; the crabs whistled like sirens from both ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb through their openings , where they stuck out their pincers and pointed them towards the enormous curtain that passed above our heads . <p> Suddenly , high up above , I noticed a red point . I fixed my eyes on it . The sea urchins , mussels , and crabs hid . The red point was falling . It was falling , and growing . It was n't a point . It was a knot of branches , of arms . It was falling . It was going to land behind me . <p> It fell past the first hills behind me . <p> It took only a second to dig out my knees ; my feet , another second . And I started to run . <p> What had fallen was a mass of coral . I sat near it , and this was what I observed : <p> As soon as it hit the ground , this mass consulted each of its individual entities , and they unanimously agreed to hold a vote of protest against all the zoophytes in the entire globe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant kingdom . The mass in question then grew larger and released into the air hundreds of intertwined branches , solid , shiny branches in a thousand varieties of red on white zigzags with fanciful trimmings . This is what it looked like from the ground up . <p> From the ground down it released sharp pointy roots . I directed a beam of vision at one of these roots and with it I began to descend , and I descended . <p> We passed through six different layers of earth at an outrageous speed , and when we arrived at the seventh , we stopped . The roots took a seat and asked permission to extract its nutrients . A character with a Mephistophelian face gave them all the permissions they desired . I then went back up along with the first nutritive ration . <p> I sat down , once again , in the same place and stared with astonishment at this coral tree . But something distracted me : standing beneath the tree , smiling , in a wide overcoat , a bowler hat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plump man . He greeted me with the utmost courtesy , winked his eye and in a slow voice , said : <p> -- Good afternoon . <p> He coughed , smiled , spat , and said : <p> -- My name is Desiderio Longotoma . <p> He closed his umbrella , and continued : <p> -- My good sir : I have the pleasure of telling you that with one eye I followed the depths of your vision while with the other eye I observed you during the entire period of your ascension and descension . <p> In regards to the former , I have nothing to tell you , for you saw as much as I , although I doubt that you have understood in all their breadth the different layers of our planet , above all , the seventh . But in regards to the latter , I should inform you of the following : <p> Through the duration of your voyage -- it is more accurate to say the voyage of your vision -- you slept with your other eye , and in the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ineffable imbecility of your expression , and the consummate cretinousness of your smile kept me from entertaining even the slightest doubts about the nature of your aforementioned dream . <p> I do not want , thus , to be at all ambiguous when I assure you that you believed with all certainty in a heavenly region that contained all that is good , noble , and beautiful in this world . <p> Nor do I wish to remain in the terrain of falsehood when I assure you that as your vision traveled through the first six layers , and especially as it spent the night in the seventh , you observed with distraction and disdain , and thus you could not refrain from -- human nature , of course -- comparing the sweetness of paradise with this layer 's Mephistophelian character and rotten decay , and concluding that you preferred the former one thousand and one times more than the latter . <p> It is extremely painful for me to refute your convictions in this respect , especially since they are so firmly rooted in your brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , I must proceed by extracting from the center your fixed convictions and reestablishing balance and truth by taking what is at the top and putting it at the bottom , and putting at the bottom what is at the top . <p> Without wasting any time , now that time is pressing , I must tell you that you are correct , in every sense of the word correct , to have classified as Mephistophelian and demonic the beings and objects in the seventh layer , and as pure and celestial all that you observed when you closed your eyes and entered the heavenly vault . But I also must advise you -- and I request that you give this all of your attention -- that it is an incredible and unspeakable human error , which has occurred for centuries and centuries , to attribute an ominous tint to the subterranean beings in the seventh layer , and a benevolent tint to those beings who shine in the blue of the upper layer . <p> An error , good sir , a profound error ! <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magicians have vigorously fought to create this ridiculous change of values , and they have been so successful that it can now be said , without exaggeration , that there is not a human being on Earth who does not believe that evil exists in those creatures with horns , tails , pointy eyebrows , who smell of sulphur , and who carry sharp swords ; and that good exists in what is blue , in what emits the fragrance of lilies , in what glows like quivering candles , in what gently lowers its eyelids . <p> My good sir , I repeat : an error , a profound error ! <p> It is exactly the opposite . <p> Centuries ago , evil was seen in white petals , soft silk , and the gentle trill of the night air . I request that you blindly believe me . And I request , as well , that you blindly believe that neither one way of thinking nor the other is definitive : they are only paths , long and tortuous paths that in the end arrive only at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , that your heart 's deepest desire is to go towards what is good , it pleases me greatly to inform you of the best possibilities to attain this good . <p> This tormented coral tree that takes in nutrients from the seventh layer of demons and vermin , throws , as you see , a great red shadow , which reflects all that is created and accomplished in this layer . Sit in this shadow , and when you feel that you have been inundated by its influence , contemplate , with both body and soul , your deepest thoughts , and perhaps one day you will see for yourself what is good . For not one human being has been able to meditate on this good without having first spent several years sitting in a similar shadow , or under the influence of something analogous . <p> I hope that you will be able to take the utmost advantage of the wise advice that I , your most faithful and revered servant and friend , have given to you . I look forward to seeing you again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desiderio Longotoma . <p> That said , he finished his good-byes , opened his umbrella , and left . <p> And now I sit , beneath this tormented and magnificent tree , and meditate on his wise words . November 1st <p> Today I had surgery on my ear and telephone . Doctor Huala , in person , administered the chloroform and scalpel . <p> This is how the events took place : <p> For quite some time I have loved Camila , wildly . She loves me one day out of every eight , and during the remaining days she laughs at me , wildly , and there is as much wildness in her laughter as there is in my love . <p> For the past seventeen days , however , Camila 's laughter has gone beyond all previous wildness to the point where today I returned to my house with a greater desire to die than to live . But before putting an end to my existence , I dialed her telephone number(n3) and listened . <p> A few seconds later , Camila spoke . By the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one day out of every eight . But then I experienced a cruel deception . I said : <p> -- I love you , Camila ! Camila , I love you ! She responded with a quick little laugh , a sharp laugh , which jabbed into me like the sting of a rattlesnake . <p> -- My Camila , have mercy -- I shouted three times . <p> And her laughter only grew louder . <p> Overcome with anger , I tried with an abrupt and decisive gesture to yank the receiver from my ear , and to decisively cut off all communication between us . But just as I began this gesture , I felt a strong pain throughout my ear , as though it were being pulled by thousands of demons . At the same time , her laughter continued to pierce me with a sharpness that bristled my nerves . <p> -- Camila , I beg you , stop laughing . <p> In vain . Her laughter now echoed interminably . <p> -- Camila , it would be better if you told me you hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the receiver from my ear . It resisted in such a way that I understood that if I kept trying I would knock over the base to which it was mounted . I tried to pull it away with a gentle touch . Useless . I tried to unscrew it like a bolt . Also useless . And her inexhaustible laughter kept pouring out , and spreading across my head . What could I do ? <p> There was only one thing to do : reach for the scissors to cut the cord . I did n't care if the phone was stuck to my ear as long as I did n't have to hear her cold and scornful laughter . <p> I gave the cord a snip and split it in two . Salvation ! <p> But no ! Her loud and copious laughter kept coming . <p> I ran through the house . Sweet remedy ! <p> Silence . As soon as I was a few meters from the phone , silence . <p> What a relief ! I would no longer be tortured by that diabolical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No longer would that symbol of my unfortunate love continue to enter in through my auditory nerve . Silence , silence . But soon I began to notice that , in truth , there was too much silence . <p> Not even a whisper , or a murmur , or a muffled echo , nothing . My feet on the floorboards stepped on cotton ; when I clapped my hands , not even one wave of sound was released into the air ; when I screamed at the top of my lungs , my voice was an underground vault . Complete silence . <p> Terrified , I picked up a bottle of wine from the Rhine Valley and threw it against the bathroom mirror : the bottle shattered , the wine flew through the air , and the mirror was pulverized . All of this in the silence of a cloudless night over a snowy and deserted mountaintop . The peace of a tomb , an absolute peace . A perfect suppression of any manifestation of all auricular life . <p> I wo n't deny it : I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from the side of existence on which all other human beings live . <p> Nevertheless , a hope . With cautious steps , I walked towards the room with the telephone . Silence , an ever-present silence . <p> I arrived . I stopped three meters from the phone , and leaned against the wall . Each minute a drop of blood dripped from the severed phone cord . But not a sound nor a whisper , nothing . <p> I walked no faster than the minute hand on the clock . Silence . <p> Silence , yes , throughout the entire interminable first meter . <p> Until I arrived at the very beginning of the second meter . <p> Then , from far away , at an extraordinary distance , I heard , faintly but at the same time with clarity , a jingling , which , because of its distance , made me think of antipodes ; it sounded like crystal shards on ice . <p> I kept walking . The jingling grew louder . Now it sounded like a voice draining the house , soaking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape , vibrates , bounces off the walls . My destiny is marked : defenseless , subdued , I take the last step . And I am nearly deafened by the wounding sound of Camila 's sarcastic laughter . <p> No more precaution , no more deliberation . I jump from one side to the other : towards the telephone , away from it ; towards the piercing laughter , then towards the absolute silence . O the incessant scorn from my one and only love , o the silent abyss between myself and the world . <p> And the days begin to pass , outside of my eardrums . <p> Monotonous days , exactly the same . <p> I sleep well , and I wake up at the same time as always , but I feel three times more tired than before , now that one of the three ways of sleeping is no longer available to me : I can sleep on my back , and on one side , but the telephone receiver stuck to my ear prevents me from sleeping on the other . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the remaining pieces of my broken mirror . I test out all the possible methods of taking the phone off my ear : force , subtlety , a knife , a lubricant . No success . <p> I walk with soft steps through each room of the house and , from time to time , I entertain myself -- the only entertainment possible -- by verifying and re-verifying -- until I am properly sated -- that everything becomes silent in my presence . <p> I then walk to the telephone , always with the naive and distant hope that silence will have penetrated its domain . No ! Camila 's laughter is always there , entrenched in the machine , and suspended in several meters of the surrounding air . <p> I return to my study . I put a record on the phonograph and , as always , I comfortably settle into my armchair . Each day , I like to experience the great pleasure -- unavailable to others -- of knowing that in the entire room there is sound , even when I do n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I close my eyes , and meditate , and on each occasion -- like clouds of smoke taking shape , or like small shapes swimming in the clouds -- I sense that another interpretation of the silent world is beginning to form , an interpretation useless to anyone who can hear . Another face , another meaning , another reason , which only begins to form when the silence is definitive unto eternity . <p> But then I remember that for me this is n't the case . For if on one side I do not hear , I hear -- and do I hear ! -- the moment my receiver enters the zone occupied by Camila 's laughter . <p> Maybe this time there will be silence ? <p> My hope is revived , a double hope : no longer to hear her wretched laughter ; and to walk unblemished through my new perceptions of this insinuated world . <p> I run to the telephone . I extend my neck . And tilt the receiver . <p> Camila laughs , Camila laughs , jingles and drives ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene repeats itself . The phonograph spins another record . <p> It 's like this every day , every hour . Either the tomb , or the scorn of Camila . <p> Slowly the habit possessed me . My entire organism adapted to this new mode of existence . The tomb filled with silent meanings ; the laughter infiltrated me with the pleasure of suffering . A sweet and sorrowful happiness came more and more to take the place of my previous activities . Thousands of objects which hid from my intimate life beneath the ever-echoing sounds of existence now obediently presented themselves to me like delicate gifts . All the empty space that surrounded me became populated with unsuspected existences . And over this new world , the suffocating pleasure of torment that Camilla inflicted upon me absorbed like pepper in my flesh . <p> It 's been three days since I told myself that , from this point on , I will be happy until the end of my life . But yesterday , doctor Huala appeared at my door . <p> The good man had been informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and up until recently , I -- considered to be my disgrace . I told him there was no disgrace . But he would n't listen to me . He went to the window and opened it wide . With thousands of faces and gestures , he led me to understand that the entire outside world , all that could be seen of the city , the distant mountains , and the sky , was infinitely flowing with living sounds . <p> The good man tempted me . He has tempted me . I tilted my head . <p> Today he has come ; he has operated on me , and chloroformed me . Afterwards , he reconnected the receiver to the bloody , hanging cord . And today I once again heard the sounds of life . <p> And all of the unsuspected existences , and all of my peaceful meditations have vanished . And all of the pleasure in pain has disappeared . Now everything echoes frantically . And so to know what to expect in this world which provokes in me an infernal chaos , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial 52061 , and wait . December 1st <p> Today I returned from a long trip . A few days after the operation , and at the advice of Doctor Huala , I boarded in Valparaiso the S.S. Orangutan of the H. T. T. K. C. <p> We stopped at the following ports : <p> Coquimbo. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . Coquimbo is known as the land of coconut and cherry trees . Everything here is born , grows , lives , fructifies , and dies in accordance with the cherry and coconut trees . What does not follow this line is immediately picked up by the police and thrown into the sea with a stone tied to its neck , and if it does not have a neck , then the stone is tied to its most prominent part . During our stay we had occasion to see two definitive submersions : a ) a German scholar who had the nerve to declare in front of the country 's elite that the study of extra-sclerotic orbital pterygoidal worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry tree regardless of how many of them there were in Coquimbo ; and b ) a mattress which had innocently torn a bit of its fabric , and exposed its contents to the eyes of the authorities : cotton stuffing , and not the coconut filament or cherry sawdust found in all the other mattresses of the city . <p> Aside from those acts which offended our sensibilities as Santiaguinos , the rest of our stay in Coquimbo was wonderful , absolutely wonderful . <p> Wherever we looked and in any way that we looked , our eyes fell on a coconut tree guarded by two cherry trees , and the only variation to this ineffable scene was the rare occasion on which there was one cherry tree guarded by two coconut trees . <p> In fact our enchantment with Coquimbo became so unbearable that the Captain decided to set sail without any further delay . <p> Antofagasta. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . A city that has left us with inerasable memories -- for a city entirely of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wool streets , wool trees , and wool people . And from time to time , a famished fakir , entangled in wool , comes to the city , and yawns . <p> So much peace in that woolen sky . The residents of Antofagasta contemplate the sky by raising their woolen pupils . They subtly alter the name of their beloved " An-to-fa-ga-sta , " and fall into ecstasy at the thought of how in the past , everything -- because it was not made of wool -- deteriorated , and how now -- now that everything is made of wool -- nothing deteriorates . Then they tune all of the instruments in the region to the key of F , and with these instruments -- always in F -- they sing , swaying until the sun sets in the west , leaving in its place the taste of astronomical wool . <p> Iquique. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . But how different it is from the previous two cities , almost as though it did not belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the cradle , the universal cradle , of all the birds in the world whose song is shrill and hesitant . <p> Any bird that sings like this , and who did not see the light of day in this land will not survive : it will surely be eaten by serpents , scorpions , tarantulas , and other bacteria . The birds , in contrast , that were born here -- and who later take off in fast flight through the five parts of the globe -- make it to old age , make it to a ripe old age , to that old age without feathers , without wings or beaks , though always with their exquisite song , their sharp and stunning song . <p> The people who live here try to imitate these notes . And with good reason . The sound they release into the air is so enchanting that ten minutes before anchoring all of the passengers aboard the Orangutan began to chirp like these pretty birds . When the captain heard us , he silenced our deafening whistles with the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mollendo. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . But this town is completely different . <p> In Mollendo , everything is round , cottony , and brown . And moreover everything is soft and cushy , so much so that its residents recline anywhere and everywhere , wherever they happen to feel drowsy : on a branch , on a rock , in a chimney , on the ocean 's waves , absolutely anywhere . <p> Then they eat . The only thing they eat are earthy-tasting round rolls . Afterwards , they rinse their hands in the sea , and since the water is brown , and since the bread crumbs are also brown , with each rinse of the hands , Mollejo becomes more and more brown . And with the earthy wind that blows here every night , and with the lazy licks of the waves , Mollendo becomes more and more round . <p> The captain has told me that within a few years this entire place will be one round , cottony ball the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . It is also an extremely curious port . It is formed by mountains of transparent salt , just like those salty stones that are licked by cows . The sea , when it reflects these mountains , turns a glaucous color . <p> The people who live here -- it goes without saying -- are like people everywhere , except that when they cross these mountains they acquire strange forms , like frail little figures . <p> As the ship came to anchor , it left behind a trail of colorless , featureless spittle . We watched with dying eyes as glaucous as the sea . <p> Pacasmayo. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . But what a difference from the previous towns ! What a contrast ! What crazy colors ! Every imaginable color and many other colors which perhaps I could not see were in the leaves and the fruits of its trees . And each color was bright , vibrant , definitive . A crazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the thick sea was like oil colors ; it moved slowly , and it tinged the hull of the ship with a rainbow that detached itself as we traveled . The sailors would dip a finger in these colors , then suck on it happily . And the strangest thing about this curious port was that a parrot could be seen in each tree , in each branch , in each fruit . <p> All of the parrots screamed at the same time and without even one second of interruption . The noise was so loud that during the twenty hours of our stay we communicated through sign language because we could not hear a word . <p> As we sailed away , Pacasmayo looked like a giant blaze with fiery tongues of red , yellow , green , and orange , which moved and twisted as a bit of wind swayed the branches of the trees and the feathers of the parrots . <p> We heard from the blaze the bitter cry of the birds ; and later we heard an out of tune murmur that lasted until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parrots were silent . <p> Pimentel. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . But quite different from the previous town . <p> A splendid Nile green plain , endless , with thousands , millions of trees , equidistant one to the other . Their trunks stood straight as pins ; their leaves were round and almost black , The captain himself told me that these trees produced pepper . Once he said that , we both started to sneeze loudly . <p> During the three days we were anchored here , we saw nothing : not one dog on the street , nor one fish in the water , nor one bird in the air . Bored , the captain gave orders to lift anchor , and the Orangutan set sail . <p> Patia. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . Enormous , low-hanging green leaves , which tilt towards the earth , forming blue hollows . <p> The people from Patia recline in the hollows , lazily humming a tune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bright blue sea , which flows beneath the leaves . A sea that has no horizon , for where the horizon should appear , the leaves mask everything . <p> Out of curiosity , I picked up a leaf . I too could not see the horizon , but a mountain that hid the horizon appeared , and came closer and closer to me . A mountain that surrounded the entire sea . It was a metallic cherry red , exactly the color of an avocado pit . This cherry red was reflected in short though numerous rays on the bright blue water . The captain told me that the mountain was actually made of metal and that from its base it emitted and scattered liquid into the sea . In response to this , I let go of a leaf and once again the green saturated it . My response was completely useless . <p> Manta. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay . <p> This town has three inhabitants who rotate the responsibility of completing the three necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second sleeps , and the third one eats . Afterwards , the one who keeps guard sleeps , the one who sleeps eats , and the one who eats keeps guard . And this , successively , until infinity . <p> The one who keeps guard sits atop a pine tree ; he salutes the passing ships ; he runs to greet those ships that anchor , and he shakes the hands of important officials , passengers , and the crew . <p> The one who sleeps lies in a red tent . He sleeps deeply , and dreams -- always the same dream -- unhappily , of the beauty and grandeur of Guayaquil . <p> The one who eats squats behind a bush . He sticks out his hand and grabs a gannet . He eats it alive , with its beak , its feet , its feathers , every part of it . The bird lets out blood-curdling cries . <p> In effect . Not even an hour after we anchored our ears were drilled with the most horrible , the most frightful howl that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that scream scared the other birds in the area , especially the other gannets : the sky filled with hundreds of thousands of birds overcome with fear .

@@4011941 What are we going to do about contemporary African art ? At one level this is a general cocktail-party question ; at another , more immediate one , it sets expectation right in our professional laps . Quite certainly for many the hope is that it might just go away , rather as when a child who knows a monster is lurking in the closet pulls the sheets over his head , on the comforting thesis that what one does n't recognize is n't there . This attitude seemed fairly prevalent at last year 's Triennial Symposium in Washington , D.C. Notwithstanding the noble efforts of Janet Stanley and the indefatigable Jean Kennedy to open the question on their panels , the topic was considered at best marginal , at worst a regrettable intrusion of a tiresome product outside the concerns of serious scholars . But owing to the inherent creativity of African artists , the issue of contemporary art will not go away . <p> Why does the subject appear so resistant , or , equally accurate , why are we so resistant to the subject ? One explanation indicates a scholarly desire for purity , the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent modifications that make pronouncements suspect . This is partly the inheritance Africanists acquired from anthropologists who yearn to find that untouched Edenic group Upon such residual authenticity they can base pontification about the eternal primeval nature of people before scholars like themselves arrived to explain the reasons for their behavior . David Brokensha once commented how , in their search for the untouched primitive world , some anthropologists would angle their cameras to block out the background sights of market , school , and church . Never has this mood been better expressed than in a recent cartoon by Gary Larson : a " tribal " family , espying approaching anthropologists through the window of their house , busily set about concealing their telephone , TV , and VCR set . They know what they are expected to display , just as the Maasai know what postures are expected of them , even though on inquiry they will inform the incompetent tourist of the correct lens stops and shutter speeds for the local lighting so that their culture can be properly recorded . <p> We do n't like modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary boundaries -- in fact it challenges them at the profoundest level . It requires us to make intellectual change , as when a professor discovers the disturbing news that , owing to more recent research that he personally has not gotten around to reading but knows about from his students ' bibliographies , he will have to make some amendments to his lecture notes that have lasted so well through recent decades . Certainly it is convenient to be assured that studies can organize all the known elements of a field and that there will not be later intrusions of material that may make nonsense of the most deliberate certainties . That is reason enough to avoid the flux of current artistic production -- at least Leonardo is n't going to paint something more , or , even worse , something different . <p> This attitude seems peculiarly consistent among Africanists . It is not apparently shared by those critics who gain reputation by presenting the latest artists from New York . In fact , among such cognoscenti , novelty is a bonus because it permits almost instantaneous expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic is the monocular pioneer creating simultaneously a career for himself and for the lucky artist his discovery applauds -- sink or swim together in the manner of that high priest Clement Greenberg , forever made memorable by Tom Wolfe in The Painted Word . The artist 's fame becomes the critic 's , to rise or fall depending whether the latter 's words or the former 's messy canvases attract the attention of those who happily relate convinced approval to a solid check . <p> This practice does n't seem to work for the African artist , perhaps because his critics are all but nonexistent Still , that fact does not answer the residual question of why . Surely , if things were nurtured , if the aesthetic garden were mulched and manured , there could be both profit and distinction in the role that has provided fame and fortune in the realm of European and American art . Is ignorance the reason , or are there perhaps sufficient opportunities already sustained by art journals that , unlike African Arts , continuously illustrate contemporary production ? <p> Few seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unproductive and , more crucially , unprofitable . What is missing is any conviction that there is any aesthetic basis for justifying a new product to the art community . None of the ready options are satisfactory The spectrum of the contemporary artist ranges from the recognizably African -- in design or subject -- to the decultured international style . These extremes partly match the distinction between locally trained ( often self-trained ) artists and those who have been educated at a European art school where emulation of the current mode makes for a gratifying reputation . At one end of the spectrum the local art merges with craft ( a distinction that in itself owes much to Eurocentric categorizing ) ; at the other the African antecedent is all but eliminated as the artist seeks his place in the pantheon of the modernists with all their deliberate contrivance of aberrant and trivial novelty . <p> There is both justification and audience for both extremes , but how can success be measured when outlets scarcely exist ? Much as our purists might object , artists do prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa it is still the tourists and local diplomats who control sales . Only a valiant gallery or two , such as Nairobi 's Watatu , and the benevolence of cultural centers like the Goethe Institute provide a consistent opportunity for display . What can constitute a legitimate and logical appraisal of this ever-expanding world of new art from the African continent ? To some extent the question is artificial , since it is too rarely aired publicly to occasion speculation and debate . One likes to imagine we have advanced beyond the " amazing it comes from Africa " response . But there is still indifferent dismissal and , on the reverse side , patronizing praise . <p> The art form upon which this debate has most deliberately focused is the work of the Shona carvers in Zimbabwe , whose success owes so much to the intellectual and practical support of Frank McEwen and Tom Blomfield and the dedicated efforts of the galleries of Guthrie , Cook and Karg . Here was a true novelty : carving in stone that seemed to combine the visual inventiveness of pure form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African tradition . Being effectively sponsored by a range of entrepreneurs , mostly honorable , the work did receive appraisal in London . The Daily Telegraph 's opinion was that " of the leading ten sculptor-carvers in the world , perhaps five come from Zimbabwe . " Such is the dismal state of contemporary design , this might mean little more than that the result was better than battered metal incompetently welded that nowadays passes for distinction , but it raises other international standards that only London has persuasively argued . ( Of course , the comment has been lovingly repeated in this country in sales brochures that have displayed no work by the famous five , but have offered stone hippos at bargain prices . ) No other artists have achieved the standing of a cash evaluation . <p> Perhaps there are glimmers in the darkness . Marshall Mount 's seminal but dated study has been reprinted . Jean Kennedy 's long-promised tome is " in press . " PBS recently aired Carol Blue 's film on Nigerian art . Last year 's " Magicians de la Terre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though provocative to the point of exasperation , did show several African artists . It was revealing that they were all carefully selected to be as unlike those from Europe as was possible . " Quaint " and " native " works were preferred to those of the well-respected Senegalese artists working in Paris and perhaps only marginally distinguishable from other experimenters along the Left Bank . " Contemporary African Artists " opened at the Studio Museum in Harlem to fanfare but was not given the attention it deserved . One would have enjoyed more extensive critical critique of the deliberately varied cross-section of the continent that Grace Stanislaus attempted to display with such sympathetic awareness . Perhaps the event will provoke more reactions as it travels across the country to other venues , though as usual it is New York that has to be convinced . Ima Ebong promises that the contemporary art show planned for the Center for African Art in New York will be " a visually stunning and a landmark event . " <p> These events seem to suggest breakthroughs , though I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional exports from Africa , or the inflated costs of those which have already emigrated , will force collectors to replace them with contemporary substitutes . There may be a useful void . If only age determines the quality of traditional carvings , and a concept such as " contemporary tradition " is not permitted by those who control aesthetic evaluations and manage to pretend to themselves that they have no responsibility concerning financial evaluations , does this leave a vacancy for the admiration and purchase of " contemporary contemporary " ? <p> Future enterprises remain dependent on the incubation of a critical theory that will comprehend the varied efforts of so many able practitioners . This does not mean -- again to refer to The Painted Word -- that scholarship should precede creativity . That most dubious sequence of prior expectation has be disastrous for artistic invention . As a profession we ought to begin to develop some kind of conceptualization of what we expect from Africa and its artists , as the tradition , and the traditional art with which it is associated , disintegrates and adapts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes an African to Paris or London art schools ? How do we judge the results ? Do we admire his acquisition of international standards -- whatever they are -- or do we admire his resistance to them ? Do we regret the lost innocence that reflects neocolonial preference ? These lines conclude in medias res , which is a sure sign that no ready resolution is going to be provided from this source . But as the opening words queried , What are we going to do about contemporary African art ? If I knew , I would write with fewer question marks that expose my own doubts and anxieties . Lacking any more consequent conclusion , here is comment from another magazine editor . " The success we 've enjoyed demonstrates that we deliver what our readers really want .... In truth today 's magazine readers like ads . " We have reason to believe that . It is certainly far easier to prove than that our readers , and contributors , like contemporary African art . <p> Lena Williams has opened a door into a neglected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , it is the living room door . In her article " Bringing the African Legacy into the American Home " ( The Living Arts section of the New York Times , April 19,1990 ) , Williams explores the development of the Afrocentric style in the interior design of the African-American home . She defines Afrocentric as a style that celebrates the mixed legacy of the diaspora , incorporating the arts of Africa , Brazil , the Caribbean , and African-Americans . In the Afrocentric style , kente cloth may be hung as art or used as a bedspread , tablecloth , or sofa throw ; a basket from Bolgatanga may grace a mantle or hold a plant ; a chiwara may sit on the glass top of an intricately carved coffee table from Haiti . On the walls , pictures of MLK and Malcolm X are likely to be joined by that of Nelson Mandela . I suppose a billion T.V. viewers are at least subliminally aware of this style from seeing the Cosby-Huxtable home with its " naive " paintings from Senegal and Haiti , and anti-apartheid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what must be grandest brownstone in Manhattan . <p> The contemporary roots of Afrocentric are clearly traceable to the black consciousness movement of the ' 60s , when dashikis and Afro hairstyles transformed personal adornment into political gesture . But the Afrocentrism of the ' 90s is likely to be less overtly political and more broadly cultural . By now everyone has read Flash of the Spirit . And even Nancy Reagan used a Bolgatanga basket as a designer piece in one or another of the presidential Berchtesgadens . But for the African Americans interviewed by Williams , Afrocentric is a personal , committed style . Appropriately enough , her article began with a survey of the eighteenth-century Atlanta townhouse of Richard Long , art historian , connoisseur , and founder of the Triennial Symposium on African Art . Referring to his carved coffee table , Long said , " She 's Haitian . " Each of those interviewed used similar personal references . Cheryl Riley , a furniture designer from San Francisco , creates Z-shaped polystyrene " Zulu " chairs that draw upon " the energy and drama that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks of her Afrocentric creations in human terms . " They name themselves , " she says of her chairs . One of them calls itself Nefertiti . Charlayne Hunter-Gault , the PBS reporter , pointed to a green and gray marble Shona head on top of her bookcase and said , " This little lady over here is Mbuya Nehanda . She was like the Harriet Tubman of Zimbabwe . I put her up there because she is looking over us . " <p> At first glance , this attitude toward African art seems distant from that of either the scholars or the connoisseurs who we presume read this journal . Afrocentric places value on African art as sign . Concern for masterpieces is eclipsed by more generic interests in evocation and iconic resonance . For African Americans these cultural and social concerns with the arts of Africa and the diaspora are self-explanatory . But what explains the interest of Euro-American professors , cosmopolitan dealers , and readers of African Arts who are likely to grace their own bookcases or nightstands with an ibeji or akuaba ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast-beating manner of Sally Price or Marianna Torgovnick , whose recent monographs ( Primitive Art in Public Places , Gone Primitive ) proclaim their authors ' path-breaking discovery of unconscious motivations in the Euro-American ( but not African or Oceanic ) mind . And their revelation that the Euro-American mind objectifies the Other , and sees in it only the qualities it desires or fears . So what else is new ? Freud 's been dead for fifty-one years . Sure , people read their nightmares and ecstasies into other peoples ' cultures . And they probably make private reads of their own cultures too . ( What , one wonders , do Price or Torgovnick make of Roy Orbison , Roseanne Barr , the Remington bronzes , or Keane paintings ? ) <p> Given that all cultural interests beyond the most trivial are rooted in the unconscious , I wonder what the current boom in African art in non-African-American home decoration signifies ? What are the semiotics of such displays ? It was easy enough in the old days ( i.e. , before 1970 or ' 75 ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively cheap way to build an impressive collection . Roger Fry satisfied his acute but impoverished aesthetic longings in this way . And Levi-Strauss has admitted that one of the charms of living in New York in the 1940s was the ready availability of North American Indian art masterpieces in the offbeat shops and galleries of Manhattan . Those days of gaining a chance masterpiece on the cheap are gone , as the interesting research of Jules-Rosette and Steiner ( inter altos ) has made clear . So too is the thrill of the unknown . Whatever Picasso may or may not have learned from the African masks at the Trocadero , the MOMA show surely put the historical cap on " primitivism " as an inspiration for Western art . <p> I suspect it is another artistic impulse that explains the current vogue for African art as decor , the impulse James Clifford calls Ethnographic Surrealism . In the time between the Wars , French scholars , intellectuals , and flaneurs drawn to surrealism roamed the Parisian flea markets for African objets d'art . Not for their inherent excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ineffable Other . They were seeking strangeness . The delights of cultural impurity and disturbing syncretisms . Pieces of African art became objets trouves in a new aesthetic that defined beauty as " the chance encounter on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella " ( Lautreamont ) . Or , mutatis mutandis , the chance encounter of Dogon granary ladders and to guna ( carved posts from men 's lodges ) with kigango commemorative sculpture from the Gohu of southeast Kenya and the decidedly Rothkoesque paintings of Ryu Okabayashi . <p> That last curious assemblage constituted " The Canon of Verticality " show ( June 1990 ) at the Ernie Wolfe Gallery in West L.A. The gallery itself is located around the corner from the Nuart , a retro movie house with a superb neon sign ( where I saw Yeelen a couple of years ago ) , and down from Gianfranco 's , a trattoria that looks and tastes as though it were lifted from the Trastevere . The Wolfe Gallery , then , and his adjacent Turkana Gallery , function as elements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first gallery visit a few months earlier , when Ernie hosted a reception for the UCLA opening of " Art/Artifact . " That Center for African Art exhibit limited itself to a comparative history of public representations , leaving the social dimensions of exported African art to observant guests at the gallery The anteroom of the Turkana was filled with garish papier-mache heads from Guinea Bissau -- leering deformity masks perched at angles in front of monitors playing videos of last year 's Carnival . One wondered what sort of living room could accommodate these huge random objects . <p> The inside room of the gallery offered clues . A collection of tables was surrounded by African twig chairs decorated with the elan of an Onitsha sign painter . Red chairs with white polka dots . Turquoise chairs with leopard-print seat pads . And on the table , animal-print napkins a la the Nairobi tourist market were set by Franciscan dinner plates . Pre-Victorian alabaster plant holders said to have stood outside a Raja 's palace now stood by the tables as wine buckets . Over this crazed picnic scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet gopher snake , Mr. Snake . And on the walls hung the sign paintings of Nairobi artist Joseph Bertiers , whose best work resembles that of Cheri Samba , and whose worst , that of Onisco , a commercial artist I knew in Samaru who specialized in plywood portraits of Bruce Lee . Bertiers has a special fixation with the odd pastime of painting live cats . Several signs warned against such cruelty while aquamarine felines in agony raced across the painted scenes . Ernie was planning to present Bertiers ' work more formally at a chili feed on Good Friday . Lautreamont would , I think , have been intrigued . <p> I am probably stacking the deck by discussing the social use of African art in a city as unreal as Los Angeles . But then , the country has been duly warned that what L.A. is , the rest of it will become . African art enters the vocabulary of the postmodern , or whatever it is you wish to call this age when the strange is next door and the familiar at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too is Afrosurreal . A celebration of Africa as a vibrant counter in world culture . Decontextualized certainly ( the way that the West is decontextualized in Africa ) , but made part of an emerging composite in which Los Angeles , New York , Lagos , Kinshasa , and Nairobi are all part of a funky continuum . As David Byrne sings in his cumbia " Independence Day " : <p> The compass points in two directions And North and South are both the same We 'll look forward to the good fumes Come our Independence Day ... <p> This is one hell of an optimistic assessment , which naively , I suppose , does not pay attention to who 's getting paid and who 's not . But somehow Bertiers ' signs hanging at the Turkana are related to King Sunny Ade playing at the Hollywood Palladium and Nelson Mandela speaking to 100,000 intense admirers at the L.A. Coliseum . After such a long , tough decade here and in Africa , these intrusions are reasons to celebrate . <p> By John F. Povey and Donald J. Cosentino @

" One poet tells us the past must be invented : " Invent . There is no feast At the bottom of memory . " Gaston Bachelard The Poetics of Reverie <p> <p> Memory is a subject of timely and far-reaching import. 1 As postmodernists query the nature of truth , memory , and history ; as history books are rewritten to reflect multiculturalism , polyvocality , and the decentering of knowledge ; as the humanities become increasingly reflexive ; and as issues of memory loss and retrieval are researched , debated , and litigated , it is appropriate to consider how other cultures conceive of and use memory . <p> " Memory : Luba Art and the Making of History " ( exhibition and accompanying book ) explores relationships among memory , history , and art made and used by Luba people of southeastern Zaire . Memory boards , royal staffs , divination instruments , and other Luba mnemonic devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of visual arts to the formation , development , and remembrance of Luba kingship and political relations . " Memory " demonstrates that since precolonial times , the recounting of history has been a specific and highly valued form of intellectual activity among Luba ; and that visual representation has been and is a primary vehicle for the making of Luba histories of kingship and center/periphery political relations. 2 <p> Memory is not passive , and the mind is not simply a repository from which memories can be retrieved . Rather , memory is a dynamic social process of recuperation , reconfiguration , and outright invention that is often engendered , provoked , and promoted by visual images ( Kuchler &; Melion 1991 ; Casey 1987 ) . Such an approach to memory is useful for understanding many African contexts in which history is both evoked and produced through oral narratives and performances . Despite ideologies that suggest that history -- like truth -- is immutable , expressive forms change over time . Paradoxically , their flexible semantic structures allow for the creative re/construction of memory , while at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they render concepts , emotions , and interactions concrete ( Vansina 1985 ) . A sense of security results , as expectations of how things always have been and should be are confirmed , even as new solutions are sought to meet evolving needs . <p> For Luba peoples , objects and performances generate memory for historical documentation , political negotiation , and everyday problem-solving . This exhibition program presents the nuanced relationships of memory and visual representation in the production of Luba historical thought to suggest how the work of memory is a work of art , and vice versa . Myth and the Written Word <p> Luba peoples inhabit the vast savanna , rolling hills , and scrubby forests of Shaba , a province of present-day southeastern Zaire. 3 Their location along the tributaries and lakes of the great Zaire/Congo River , their participation in long-distance trade , and their exploitation of rich natural resources , including salt , iron , palm oil , and fish , all contributed to the establishment of an influential central African kingdom in the latter half of the present millennium ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political consolidation is revealed in an astounding archaeological record from what is now deemed the Luba " Heartland . " Advanced metalworking and ceramic technologies over a 1,500-year continuum , as well as linguistic factors , identify Luba as a preeminent proto-Bantu population of central Africa -- that is , as the nucleus for expansion by peoples now inhabiting much of central Africa. 4 In addition , Luba are recognized for an extensive and brilliant body of oral history , court poetry , and visual arts. 5 These include a wide range of royal sculptures and emblems from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries , when the Luba kingdom was at its height . The wealth of these materials make the Luba past a rich field for investigating African notions of memory and history , and how they may be related to state formation and other processes of political economy . <p> A caveat is in order . The written discourses and on-the-ground policies of colonialism and the early postcolonial periods have contributed to the creation of a Luba ethnicity or " super-tribalism , " based on growing urbanism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reflecting the supposed precolonial existence of a Luba " empire . " 6 Such a rigid model of centralized rule is the result of a literal reading of the founding myth of sacred kingship and a fundamental misunderstanding of African political economy by Belgian colonial authorities , based upon a prevailing sense that kingdoms must have existed , even when evidence suggested the contrary . This is by no means to say that a Luba state did not exist , nor would we diminish its accomplishments in political economy , erudition , art and expressive culture , and other domains . Indeed , these are the principal subjects celebrated in " Memory . " Instead , we suggest that the Luba state was a far more flexible set of relationships than " empire " connotes , extending in a wide circle of influence rather than authority . " Luba " is a social identity available to a much vaster complex of cultures than that of the Heartland itself . As Pierre Petit notes , it is a most ambiguous category that may refer to five thousand or five million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1993:30 ) . <p> To understand how notions of Luba ethnicity and empire were constructed , one must first consider how Luba enshrine the origins of sacred kingship in an epic . Referred to in the literature as a " genesis myth " or a " royal charter , " numerous versions of this long oral narrative have been transcribed. ? In its basic structure ( Heusch 1982 ) , Mbidi Kiluwe , a handsome hunter from the east , introduces royal bearing and a new political order to the indigenous population , then governed by a cruel , drunken despot named Nkongolo Mwamba . The union of Mbidi Kiluwe with one of Nkongolo 's sisters produces a son named Kalala Ilunga , who grows to become a heroic warrior . After great antagonism and a protracted battle with Nkongolo , Kalala defeats his maternal uncle with the help of a visionary named Mijibu wa Kalenga and accedes to the throne to institute sacred kingship as embodied and introduced by Mbidi . All subsequent Luba kings are said to descend from Kalala Ilunga . <p> This political charter gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories written by early European observers have been based on a literal interpretation of the myth as narrated at the royal court , thereby promoting the notion of a single dynastic line ruling a Luba " empire . " The term " empire " first appeared in several histories formulated by Belgian territorial administrators . In his influential Baluba et Balubaises du Katanga ( 1936 ) , Edmond Verhulpen asserted that there were two Luba " empires , " the first that of Nkongolo through the seventeenth century , and the second that of Kalala Ilunga , established thereafter . This second empire allegedly extended to Lake Tanganyika , drawing numerous ethnic groups into the sphere of Luba sovereignty and giving rise to the term Balubaises , or " Luba-ized " peoples . This useful term suggests a dynamic process through which attributes of one culture are emulated , adopted , and adapted by people of another ; but there is no credible evidence that Luba-ized peoples ever constituted an " empire " ruled by a supreme authority . Instead , a Luba polity based around the Upemba Depression constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raiding outward from this center served both defensive and offensive purposes , but there is no substantive proof that " imperial authority " was imposed or even sought by Heartland Luba kings , at least in most cases . <p> Approaching Luba political organization through contemporary oral accounts stimulated by visual mnemonics , as well as through the available archaeological record , provides a more useful perspective on Luba polity than that of " empire . " Although court chronicles accentuate the preeminence of a single royal patriline originated by Mbidi , the mysterious hunter-hero from the east , archaeological records show that Luba have had a continuous and progressive history of socio-political and technological development for more than fifteen hundred years , with no radical changes in kind or degree , and with no clear evidence of the introduction of a new and foreign political order. 8 Likewise , visual arts and contemporary oral testimonies generated about them indicate that Luba power rested not with a single dynastic line of kings or with a single " center , " but with a multicentered constellation of chieftaincies , officeholders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to what we suggest to be a largely mythical center . The paradox is explicit : there is no real center , yet belief in one allows cultural integration of an entire region . Identification with a " center " -- more an ideological construct than an empirical reality -- was a means of legitimizing the " periphery . " 9 <p> Contemporary Luba accounts of the past contradict monolithic descriptions of a Luba empire that are presented in colonial histories , suggesting more fractured and flexible Luba authority than presumed . The recent transformation of the Luba genesis myth into a writ- ten history has diminished the Epic 's multidimensionality , and its ability to be retold and remade with every narrative performance . As James Clifford states , in our endeavor to " write " culture , we transform the disjunction of lived experience into the integrated portraits of our cultural representations ( 1988:39 ) . The impact of the Epic , continually reconfigured according to contemporary socio-political realities , is weakened in the process . Yet as we shall see , just such refabulation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of memory . Memory in the Present <p> It is no longer possible to fully retrieve or reconstruct a positivist 's " true " picture of the Luba past . What can be pieced together are the resonances and reprises of later generations . Academic historians possess other tools , of course ( Vansina 1985 ) ; yet " history is always a problematic and incomplete reconstruction of what is no longer . . . a representation of the past " ( Nora 1984:xix ) . It is truer to lived experience to consider the past as represented and assigned value according to its purposes for group identity and political legitimacy in the present ( cf. Mudimbe 1988:195 ) , and memory is always now . <p> Luba are concerned with their past , and like people everywhere , they continually reconfigure nationalist and local histories to meet emerging needs of political economy . Often , the primary means for doing so is through text/object relations -- that is , how texts are attached to , or secreted in , visual representation . Although text/object relationships have received less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important ways that many African peoples construct and perpetuate their pasts , and at the same time serve as registers of present significance . <p> Bogumil Jewsiewicki and V.Y. Mudimbe ( 1993 ) propose that memory represents a rich , as yet untapped resource for African history . And even though memory remains an abstract , ambiguous concept , its study permits an incisive approach to understanding indigenous notions of history . " Memory in all its various forms can thus be used much more effectively than ' oral tradition ' to conceptualize the post-scripted word " ( Jewsiewicki &; Mudimbe 1993:4 ) , for " memory is the raw material of history " ( Le Goff 1992 : flap ) . Despite how obvious the answer may seem , we still must ask : What is memory ? The Cultural Construction of Memory <p> Memory has had its own histories in Western and non-Western societies ( Casey 1987 , Yates 1966 , Terdiman 1993 ) . While definitions are perpetually modified , recent research suggests an important premise : memory is not a discrete , biologically grounded , universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cultural construction varying from one society to the next. 10 Memory exists in what Kirsten Hastrup calls " Uchronia " ( 1991:113 ) . Just as a Utopia is ideal because , as reflected in the word 's ancient Greek roots , it is a " non-place , " so a Uchronia is " a structured world , nowhere in time . " Such positions contradict previous theories that memory is a universal function of the mind , a storage bank , so to speak , wherein data and knowledge may be deposited and retrieved at will ( Kuchler &; Melion 1991:3 ) . <p> Cross-cultural examination demonstrates the extent to which memory is a particular invention of every society and every era , reflecting local cosmologies and inexorably changing cultural values . Memory is active , always in the present ; it is a construction , transaction , and negotiation , as opposed to a reproduction . History , too , is particular to and located in a social and moral universe , from a Luba or any point of view that does not subscribe to positivist absolutism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uchronic , history is linked to time . As it is understood here , history is a formalization of memory that implies performance of " involved remembrance " ( Connerton 1991:4 ) -- that is , contingent purpose and the seizing upon " the explosive pertinence of a remembered detail " ( Davis &; Starn 1989:5 ) . <p> Pierre Nora further differentiates memory from history in ways important to our project : <p> Memory is life . . . . It remains in permanent evolution , open to the dialectic of remembering and forgetting , unconscious of its successive deformations , vulnerable to manipulation and appropriation , susceptible to being long dormant and periodically revived . History , on the other hand , is the reconstruction , always problematic and incomplete , of what is no longer . . . . Memory installs remembrance within the sacred ; history , always prosaic , releases it again . . . . Memory takes root in the concrete , in spaces , gestures , images , and objects ; history binds itself strictly to temporal continuities , to progressions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history can only conceive the relative . <p> And finally , <p> history is perpetually suspicious of memory , and its true mission is to suppress and destroy it . ( Nora 1989:7-8 ) <p> <p> Through the centuries , Luba have made history , as they have consolidated their political economy . In reaction , peoples peripheral to the Luba Heartland have made theirs , as well . Memory remains , however , as lieux de memoire -- places or concrete things bounded by secular history , to which one can repair and still find release into the affect and ecstasy of memory 's Uchronia . <p> We must , then , consider the dynamic processes of making history ; yet , as Anton Blok notes , such a phrase " is not without its problems . First , it carries voluntarist overtones . As Marx wrote in his Eighteenth Brumaire , ' men make their own history , but they do not make it just as they please ' " ( 1991:121 ) . History takes form in the structures of mythical thought , as Luc de Heusch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must recognize the ironies and accidents through which history is composed ; but we must not overlook the intentionalities because of which history calls upon memory . Furthermore , a dominant faction 's history may require subservient people 's " forced forgetting , " yet " counter-memory " persists as a subversive source of ontological alternatives. 11 Memory and history are closely interdependent , then . Indeed , " memory seems to be the main place where culture exists " ( Teski &; Climo 1995:2-3 ) . <p> In order to reconstruct any culture 's history , one must begin with an understanding of what that culture means by history and memory in the first place , for " without understanding their conception of history and their attitudes toward it , we can not hope . . . to interpret these critical sources . For this reason we must first examine what that attitude entails , what the relevant modes are that help shape their collective thought , and what the different genres of oral traditions are " ( Vansina 1978:15 ) . Luba Memory and Mind <p> Like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget , yet there is no reason to believe that they necessarily do so ( or at least understand their doing so ) in the same ways that one does in the West . To begin to grasp what Luba mean by " memory , " one can consult dictionaries that have been compiled for Luba and neighboring peoples . Looking up memoire , one finds the words kalandu , mulandu , nangunangu , lutesima , and lute ( Gillis 1981:324 ) . Checking these terms in E. Van Avermaet and Benoit Mbuya 's wonderfully encyclopedic Dictionnaire Kiluba-Francais ( 1954 ) , one finds a fan of meaning and usage suggesting the transactional notion that Luba and their neighbors ascribe to what we in the West call " memory . " <p> There , kalandu and mulandu are both simply defined as memoire ( memory ) , while the related milandu is " a dispute to which one returns " -- that is , one which is unresolved and still a source of contention ( Van Avermaet &; Mbuya 1954:338 ) . 12 Kilanda is an outstanding debt , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , affliction , chagrin , regret , abandonment , isolation , or solitude " ( p. 337 ) . The unfulfilled nature of exchange ( debt ) and of expectation or desire ( poverty ) nonetheless expresses relationships and transaction . The Luba verb from which these nouns are derived , kulanda , is " to lie " the truth is " missing " ) ; but then , in what may seem a curious extension , a derivative verb ( kulandala ) is " to cross over a watercourse on a bridge , a tree trunk , or a branch , " or " to crawl ram-per in French like a lizard , snake , insect , or snail . " At issue are connections , sometimes salubrious , sometimes not , and the resulting relationships that are presumed or posited . <p> The same terms find roughly similar development in neighboring dialects . For Tabwa , the verb kulanda is " to speak " ; kulandula , " to contradict or protest " ; and mulandu , " words , speech , an affair , litigation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contexts of local politics ; but again , mulando is " a tree thrown across a stream as a bridge , " in a more literal connection between one bank and the other ( Van Acker 1907:42 ) . Mulandu does not appear to mean " memory , " as it may for Luba ; instead , such a sense is found in the verb kulanga , " to show , " with derivatives meaning " to demonstrate , prove , teach , remind , remember , think , or reflect " ( Van Acker 1907:43 ) . Among " eastern Luba " and neighboring Lamba , malango ( or malangu ) is also " memory " ( Vandermeiren 1913:776 ; Doke 1933:76 ) . As a Tabwa noun , mulanga is " a string of beads , " suggesting that the contingencies of beads in a necklace can be lent symbolic significance , and foreshadowing discussion in Memory of bead necklaces as important mnemonic devices. 13 The attribution of meaning to such contingencies ( or the idea that contingency is meaning ) is reflected in translations of malango @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A common praise name for God is Leza Malango , " Almighty Intelligence " ( Van Acker 1907:43 ; Theuws 1954:80 ) . God may possess such omnipotent thought and knowledge , but It ( for no gender is asserted ) does so through Its demonstration ( kulanga ) of what we in the West would call memory . <p> A final Luba term allows one to speculate about the location of memory in human anatomy , and the nature of the mind itself . Lute is defined as " memoire , " and someone possessing lute " has a good memory -- he retains or remembers well . " Lute may be derived from the verb kuta , " to set , spread out , or extend " ( tendre in French ) , as one does a hunting net , or when building pit traps for larger game . Kuta can also be " to hunt " more generally , and can refer to competitive games ( Van Avermaet &; Mbuya 1954:656-57 , 681-82 ) . In both hunting and game-playing , a sense of unexpected motion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memory Van Avermaet and Mbuya extend their discussion of lute by noting that luteshima is also " memoire , " and that kuta ku mushima is " to fix in the spirit , " or " remember " ( 1954:682 ) . Mushima , " the seat of sentiments " for Luba and surrounding peoples , may be the liver , where thought ( malango ) , knowledge , ideas , intelligence , will , taste , inclination , desire , love , envy , hate , suffering , and spirit are believed to originate and reside . For Luba , then , " heart , " in the figurative sense given in the West , may be the anatomical liver , while the anatomical heart , mukunka or mangu , is not attributed with any particularly spiritual qualities . But if this is so , then as the seat of thought , ideas , and intelligence , the mushima is also the mind. 14 Memory and Visual Representation <p> In addition to the culturally specific nature of memory , a second key premise of this exhibition and book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the prefix re- ) . Memory is not a discrete mental operation preceding image-production ; rather , it is " a process precipitated and shaped by the relaying of visual information " ( Kuchler &Melion; 1991:3 ) . In other words , images engender modes of recollection as much as they are determined by them . The exhibition demonstrates how Luba constructions of memory , conceptually based upon association , contingency , transaction , negotiability , and random chance are engendered visually ; and how visual and related forms of expressive culture are used to re-create memory in the present through a politics of representation and imagination . <p> If Luba have a rich vocabulary for expressing concepts of memory , they also possess a proliferation of visual forms for encoding and stimulating mnemonic processes . These include beaded necklaces and headdresses ; wooden memory boards , thrones , figures , and staffs ; and scepters , axes , adzes , spears , and other objects incorporating iron and/or copper . These things comprise the treasuries of Luba kings and certain chiefs . Instruments of divination and healing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , despite the stunning breadth and conceptual achievement of these materials , it is only recently that their mnemonic dimensions have been recognized and explored . <p> Previously Luba art had been viewed only in terms of its aesthetic appeal and for its sculptural strength ( Neyt 1994 ) , as well as for its reflection of a complex indigenous African state . The collecting conventions of the late nineteenth and early to mid-twentieth centuries emphasized and therefore valorized certain kinds of objects to the neglect of others , in response to prevailing Western definitions of " art . " Many early colonial collectors only valued works that were representational and figurative , ignoring those that lacked anthropomorphic elements ( cf. Schildkrout &; Keim 1990 ; Mack 1991:17 , 81 ) . The result is that nonfigurative works and most of those produced from beadwork , textiles , basketry , fiber , feathers , animal pelts , pottery and unfired clay , metal , gourds , and perishable materials were left behind. 15 Yet , those very objects , as well as in situ graphic arts such as painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or unfired clay shrine sculptures ( Burton 1961 ) not only frequently constitute important Luba mnemonic forms , but also shed light upon the symbolism and purpose of the works that have been collected as the West 's arbitrarily selected signifiers of Luba culture and history . <p> Among Luba , oral traditions most closely associated with royal history were dependent upon visual memory devices . These oral charters were sacred , to be guarded and disseminated by a politico-religious association called Mbudye , which has created rituals for memory transmission . Mbudye historians are rigorously trained " men of memory " ( bana balute ) who recite genealogies , king lists , and all of the episodes in the Luba Epic ( Reefe 1977 , 1981 ) . 16 They travel with kings , dance in celebration of their deeds , and spread propaganda to outlying areas about the prestige and sanctity of Luba kingship . The power of Mbudye is so great that all kings and royal officeholders undergo its initiation , and the association can dethrone a king or chief ? <p> Even though literacy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visual representation remains an integral activity of rural Luba chieftaincies . Officials still stage oral recitations of local history , and Mbudye continues as a judicial branch of authority in contemporary politics , inducting new members into its ranks . Mbudye performs public dances reenacting history and still uses visual memory aids that date from the distant beginnings of the association . Luba Memory Devices <p> Principal among Luba memory devices is the lukasa , a roughly hand-sized wooden object studded with beads and pins or covered with incised or raised ideograms . During M-budye rituals , a lukasa is used to teach neophytes sacred lore about culture heroes , clan migrations , and the introduction of sacred rule ; to suggest the spatial positioning of activities and offices within the kingdom or inside a royal compound ; and to order the sacred prerogatives of officeholders concerning contact with earth spirits and the exploitation of natural resources . <p> A lukasa is the most important record of Luba royal history . The codes of kingship are indicated by its colors and configurations of beads and carved ideograms . Culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of connotations triggering remembrance of their deeds and exploits , as well as their qualities and physical appearance . For example , Nkongolo Mwamba , the tyrannical anti-hero of the Luba charter , is always represented by a red bead , for he is the red-skinned rainbow-serpent associated with bloody violence . Blue beads ( considered " black " ) stand for Mbidi Kiluwe , the protagonist and culture-bearer of kingship whose skin is shiningly black like that of a bull buffalo , symbol of ambivalent power and secret potential ( Roberts 1995 ) . The paths of Luba migration and significant events and relationships are indicated by lines and clusters of beads . Chiefs and their counselors , sacred enclosures , and defined places are shown by circles of beads . <p> The building blocks of this mnemonic system are to be found in the myriad -- and until now , neglected -- beaded and shell emblems of Luba royalty , ranging from necklaces and badges to hats and headdresses . Beads constitute a kind of alphabet that articulates a vocabulary for Luba royalty . Their plurality of forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " cognitive cuing structures " that constitute mnemonics ( Bellezza 1981 ) . The same associations underlie the geometric designs and pictorial ideographs on both mnemonic devices like the lukasa and royal emblems in non-beaded media such as wood , metal , painting , pottery , and weaving . <p> While the lukasa of each Mbudye chapter conveys the history of the Luba state , other memory devices such as sculpted thrones , staffs , bowstands , and spears are used by individual officeholders to elicit local , family , and personal political histories , as well as histories of physical , psychological , or spiritual catharsis . A staff may be used to remember clan history and migrations , for instance . Its owner will exhibit and " read " its iconography when the legitimacy of his authority is at issue . Luba thrones and bowstands often depict female figures in memory of historically or spiritually significant women . As often , though , these female figures stand for the men who once ruled and whose wisdom women still convey as spirit mediums . Yet other mnemonic devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beads or figures of a lukasa , that are cast so that their changing juxtapositions can be interpreted . Through such divination , meaning is cut loose from matrix , so that the past may be reconstructed to identify and remedy present misfortune . <p> Questions remain . How do these mnemonics embody and enact the active principles of Luba memory while providing a cultural framework for truth ? And what is the nature of a system of representation that can produce convention and invention , remembrance and oblivescence , at one and the same time ? Lieux de memoire <p> Place memory provides a model for understanding how mnemonics generate the semantic dynamism and social construction of Luba historical thought . Recollection , as practiced by Luba , is neither an account nor a pedigree , such as a genealogy or a king list , but a meaningful configuration of selected , negotiated events around " loci of memory " ( Jewsiewicki &; Mudimbe 1993:10 ) . A locus of memory , or lieu de memoire , is a landmark around which past events structure present memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be topoi -- that is , " both places and topics , where memories converge " ( Blok 1991:125 ) . The term originated in classical texts expounding two fundamental principles of memory : places and images ( loci and imagines in Latin ) . Memory arts ( ars memoria ) were based upon memory places ( loci memoriae ) that could be " seen " and " visited " in the mind ( Pierre Nora , cited in Blok 1992:125 ) . To remember their speeches , ancient orators imagined buildings and assigned topics and subtopics to the " rooms " through which they would mentally " walk " as they delivered their talks ( Yates 1966 ) . <p> In a discussion of the powerful effects that architectural spaces can have for vivid recall , Gaston Bachelard ( 1969 ) describes how people " house " their memories and how rooms become abodes for an unforgettable past . The more nooks , garrets , attics , cellars , closets , and secret alcoves there are , the more places there are for the storage of sentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way memory is localized and enacted through space , not time . The actual duration of the past can never be relived , only the thought of it . " Memories are motionless , and the more securely they are fixed in space , the sounder they are " ( 1966:9 ) . Memory exists in Uchronia , then , independent of linear time and driving purpose , and " implying permanence and antiquity " ( Hastrup 1991:115 ) . <p> The association of memories with spaces of intimacy is what Bachelard refers to as " topoanalysis . " Camillo 's famous " Memory Theatre " of the Renaissance ( Yates 1966:129-59 ) was based upon the proposition that spatial programming can shape collective memory and consciousness . This was an imaginary space designed to store and preserve the collective knowledge of humanity , yet there was nothing performative about Camillo 's theater . It was an architectonic model -- a labyrinthine container for human history , to exist in and occupy the mind . Such a spatial paradigm maps the mind as an architecture of memory and a metonymic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved and positioned to enable remembrance . <p> These Western examples are directly applicable to Luba memory and the making of history , for powerful connections exist between spatial consciousness and memory , as expressed visually . Luba mnemonic devices , whether memory boards , staffs , necklaces , or divination gourds , are devised as lieux de memoire to organize personages , places , objects , and relationships . They encode ideology , enlist politics , and refer simultaneously to anatomy , architecture , landscape , and cosmos . These objects-as-landmarks are multilayered and multireferential , lending themselves to endless possibilities for combination . <p> The lukasa memory board , for example , is based on the spatial paradigm of the Luba royal court , analogous to the Renaissance memory theater The court exists as a mental geography that maps and orders the universe , the kingdom , human relations , and the mind . The physical and conceptual layout of the court encompasses the structure and order of Luba cosmology , while -- a bit like a cognitive pinball machine -- the beaded studs and ideograms on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrances , rebounds , ricochets , and thresholds that characterize the active social processes of memory . Since beads have no actual connection with the content to be remembered , meaning is assigned to them by contingent positioning . But although a lukasa is learned , particular meanings are assigned on a significant occasion in a specified locale for a given audience . Reading the lukasa , therefore , is dependent upon the relationships of the signifiers to one another , as well as the relationships of the reader to the audience , and the reader to the constituency that she or he represents . Memory , then , is an art of negotiation and rhetoric , not an " abstract presentation of truth " ( Fabian 1983:112 ) . <p> It is through the activities of negotiation and association that spaces and sites are transformed into places of meaning and memory . For both Edward Casey ( 1987 ) and Yi-Fu Tuan ( 1977,1990 ) , space and site are undifferentiated and anonymous , possessing " no points of attachment onto which to hang our memories , much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , characteristically presents us with a plethora of such cues . Thanks to its ' distinct potencies , ' a place is at once internally diversified . . . and distinct externally from other places . " Place aids in remembering by being " well suited to contain memories -- to hold and preserve them " ( Casey 1987:186 ) . The ultimate container for holding memories is the body itself , the vehicle through which the intimate relationship between memory and place is realized . Memory Embodied <p> Through the lived body , place and memory are actively joined . Casey ( 1987 ) discusses the conventional yet misplaced emphasis on memory as a procedure contained within the mind . Yet , as he points out , memory always lies on the border between self and other . The body constitutes the frontier of difference and sameness , and a sieve through which historical facts are negotiated through remembrance , oblivescence , and the signifying games of representation . <p> Luba works of art , which simultaneously emphasize place and body , offer a signal opportunity to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mnemonics are almost always anthropomorphized and gendered to serve as spirit containers . Scarification and coiffure , in particular , are marks of civilization that encode memory about a person 's place in society and history ( Rubin 1988 ) . These and other body arts are developed through an individual 's life , with information added as memory grows . Luba explain that only women , as child-bearers , are strong enough to hold , contain , and protect powerful spirits and the secret knowledge associated with them . Most important , every Luba king is incarnated by a female spirit medium after death . Called Mwadi , such a medium inherits the deceased king 's emblems , titles , and residence , which become a " spirit capital . " Memory lives at and through these sacred sites , in the women who embody the kings of yore , and in visual representations of such women . Through spirit possession and the way it is represented in contingent arts , Luba transform the body into a lieu de memoire and a microcosm of the Luba world . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written " and " read . " In this way , the past is perpetually reified through the embodiment of memory , lived and enacted in the present . Memory as Performance <p> As in any political context , " official " wisdom , even as conveyed through use of a lukasa , was and is contested by others ' interpretations of the same instruments . Recent research questions nineteenth-century notions of memory as a fixed and accurate record of past experience ( e.g. , Gyatso 1992 ) , suggesting that memory " is not a fossil of the past but rather a system of categorization in which the past is recreated in ways appropriate for the present " ( Lopez 1992:36 ) . Current emphasis is less on mental storage of past events than on the performative function of memory in the present . Mnemonic devices elicit visual , verbal , and performative arts , and Luba objects were and are read , spoken , sung , danced , and manipulated . <p> That the mnemonic process is performative also means that historical recitation never occurs in precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory is defective . The need to fill in forgotten details , to adapt history to new circumstances , and to follow fads by borrowing glitzy ideas from prestigious neighbors means that memory is generative . Indeed , forgetting must be understood if we are to grasp how and why history is made . The negotiation of historical facts necessarily involves a process of discarding and re-creating . " Forgetting and recollecting are allied mnemonic functions . Forgetting can be the selective process through which memory achieves social and cultural definition " ( Kuchler &Melion; 1991:7 ) . The erasure and selective elimination of certain historical facts are as critical to the collage that is memory as the retention and careful preservation of others . Early Greeks recognized that forgetting and remembering were an indissociable pair intrinsic to the memory process . Only later in the history of Western thought was forgetting forgotten. 18 <p> Luba memory devices do not symbolize thought so much as stimulate and provoke it . They afford a multiplicity of meanings through their multireferential iconography . The reading of these visual " texts " varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingencies of local politics , and makes manifest the objects ' abilities to instigate processes of politics , economy , and religion . <p> Whether through the reading of a beaded memory board , the narration of a sculpted wooden staff , or the deciphering of a diviner 's object-filled gourd , Luba mnemonics operate according to principles of contingency and association , relationship and refabulation . Some historical facts can be selectively preserved and recombined , others omitted in an editing of the past . As a result , identity and history are always in the making , as new circumstances urge reconsideration of one 's relationship to a " center " and to the past , producing the shifting and arbitrary nature of ethnic and political identity that is the Luba past and present . <p> 
@@4002241 When the topic of Junior Achievement arises in conversations among business people or educators , many recall its after-school community program in which teenagers crafted products to sell . This business education program , called the JA Company , has , since 1919 , attracted several million of America 's youth . <p> Nearly two decades ago , however , the face of Junior Achievement began to change . In 1974 , Junior Achievement 's first in-school economic education program , Project Business , was introduced to students in grades 7 to 9 . Business Basics , a program for fourth- to sixth-grade students , followed in 1978 . Then , in the early 1980s , the organization 's flagship curriculum , Applied Economics , was launched for high school students in tenth to twelfth grade . After several pilot editions of the one-semester course , the first edition of Applied Economics was published in 1985 . <p> Twenty years ago , few people could have predicted how dramatically those programs would change Junior Achievement . Although the original JA Company program is still going strong , each year it represents a smaller segment of the Junior Achievement program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all students involved in Junior Achievement . And just like the JA Company program , in-school programs feature a volunteer from the community , called a business consultant , who works with students . In addition , all Junior Achievement programs are sponsored by the business community at no cost to schools . <p> Today , Junior Achievement has eight economic and business education programs available for young people ( see sidebar ) . The articles that follow in this special section of The Social Studies describe several teachers ' experiences with three of Junior Achievement 's more popular programs : Applied Economics , Project Business , and the new K-6 Initiative . The last , which currently is being developed , is an expansion of the Business Basics program . Business Basics <p> During the 1991-92 school year , nearly 400,000 U.S. elementary school students , a majority of whom were fifth graders , participated in Business Basics . In four highly engaging lessons , these students learn what it takes to organize a business , make management decisions , manufacture a product , and market it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant-a local business person , college student , or student from the high school program . The consultant serves as a role model for the children and draws on his or her business or student company experiences to lead students in problem-solving activities , role-playing exercises , and lively discussions . The consultant and the student use the colorful , engaging materials that are enriched with readings from a newspaper-style Business Journal . <p> However , Business Basics is being supplanted by a new program in which the new K-6 framework , Business Basics , will be retooled as the fifth-grade component . <p> K-6 Initiative <p> Soon kindergarten through sixth-grade children will study how businesses , workers , and consumers carry on economic fife in their local , state , national , and international communities . They will learn concepts and skills at each grade level that build on those taught in preceding grades . Programs for grades one , two , and three have been developed and are being field tested in selected cities across the nation . Judith Lee Swets , a second-grade teacher from Grand Rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the How Does A Community Work ? program . <p> The K-6 elementary school program takes a conceptual and sequential approach to learning . It recognizes that people , as contributing members of society , assume roles as an individual , worker , and consumer and carry out these different roles in an expanding environment that extends from the self to global relations . This new program includes a variety of activities that help young students develop appropriate decision-making and workforce-readiness skills . Project Business <p> Approximately a half-million students each year participate in Project Business , Junior Achievement 's most popular program . Deeni Schoenfeld , who wrote the article about her eighth-grade class in Walnut Creek , California , is one of about 15,000 teachers who work with Project Business . <p> Key to the success of Project Business , as Ms. Schoenfeld recounts , is the cooperative effort between the business consultant and classroom teacher . The consultant brings an economic and business lesson to the students each week of the semester , but the teacher sets the stage for the consultant 's visits . In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For their preparation and presentations , consultants use a detailed program guide that allows them to choose among a variety of hands-on activities for each class period . <p> A popular feature in the Project Business curriculum is The Wizards of Sound , a twenty-two-minute video field trip about the recording industry . This video follows students from Junior High School 22 in New York City as they travel to CBS Records ; meet trumpeter Wynton Marsalis ; help mix sound tracks for a recording ; see how records , tapes , and compact discs are manufactured ; and discuss marketing techniques with CBS executives . <p> Economics of Staying in School <p> This supplementary program is a series of four activities that the program 's business consultant uses to show at-risk students the relevance of what they learn in school to life in their economic society .

" Facing the Issues " is a role-playing activity based on situations faced by someone who has dropped out of school . <p> Applied Economics <p> In my early days as a high school economics teacher , I envisioned teaching an entire course built on a framework of experiential learning that might consist of classroom simulations , student debates , and field trips into the community . With the Applied Economics program , teachers find that such a curriculum is now available to them . <p> The research on Applied Economics , taken from external evaluations conducted at three-year intervals , reveals that the program 's active learning components are its most effective . The teacher ( who conducts the course four days a week ) and the consultant ( who visits on the fifth school day ) can introduce students early in the semester to the Student Company , an activity in which students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . This might be followed by the Management and Economic Simulation Exercise , or MESE , a computer-based microeconomic simulation . <p> Applied Economics students could advance to Macroland during the latter part of the semester . In this computer simulation , they would assume the roles of government economic policymakers and Federal Reserve Board members in managing a national economy through fiscal and monetary policy . Mark Sperling , in an accompanying article , describes his use of MESE and Macroland with students at Cass Technical High School in Detroit . <p> The hands-on learning does not end with these activities . The student study guide , for example , contains many exercises that reinforce the concepts , generalizations , and other information introduced in the text . The program guide also offers a range of activities to engage students intellectually in problem solving and critical thinking . <p> Many Applied Economics classes examine current economic issues , such as teens in the labor force , the health-care crisis , and the new European Community 1992 , through Talks to Teachers . This quarterly publication is an eight-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic . <p> To assess class as well as individual progress during the semester , teachers can administer two forty-five-item pre- and post-tests of equivalent scope and difficulty . These tests are provided with the curriculum , and many teachers use them extensively . During the semester , teachers can generate end-of-chapter or -unit exams from a computer database of over 400 items . Finally , Applied Economics comes with a 100-item final exam that covers all the topics studied in the course and represents different levels of difficulty . <p> AE Rural Expansion and AE-by-Satellite <p> Through a delivery system tailored for small cities and towns , Applied Economics now is reaching many more rural school districts throughout the country . This system uses video tutorials to explain the program to school administrators and to train classroom teachers and business consultants . In turn , Junior Achievement works with the school superintendent to obtain business support for Applied Economics . This rural expansion project was initiated in 1987 in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula and is supported by a grant from the W. K.

The Phillips Petroleum Company provided a grant to support this satellite program for rural schools . <p> The range of Junior Achievement 's programs in the schools continues to grow . During the 1991-92 school year , about 1.3 million students learned about their business and economic world through one of these programs . In the articles that follow , an elementary , middle school , and high school teacher , respectively , relate their experiences with a particular program .

@@4018841 Section : BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> This final seventh volume of John Wesley 's Journals and Diaries was initiated in 1988 with the publication of Volume 18 in the Works of John Wesley , now under the general editorship of Richard P. Heitzenrater . The publication of this last volume of the Journal and Diaries represents a landmark in Wesleyan studies . The painstaking and meticulous scholarship of Ward and Heitzenrater has culminated in seven volumes of critically footnoted narrative and episodic information that will serve students of history for many decades . <p> The first six volumes of the Journals and Diaries ( Volumes 18-24 of the Works ) , after Reginald Ward 's 119-page introduction in Volume 18 to the genre of journal and autobiography , contain almost all the actual content of Wesley 's journal and diary entries . This final volume reproduces only the last extract of the Journal ( January 1,1787 to October 24 , 1790 ) and the Manuscript Diaries from January 1 , 1787 to February 24 , 1971 . Wesley died the following Wednesday , March 2 , 1791 , only a week after his last entry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an interesting evolution that is quite discernible if one compares entries in Volumes I and II with those in Volume VII . In the earlier installments there is a definite apologetic air to Wesley 's narrative -- as might be expected against hostile accounts surrounding his flight in disgrace from Georgia after the Sophy Hopkey affair , his being banned from Anglican pulpits for perceived fideism , or his conflict with Whitefield over predestination . The copious index to all seven volumes ( contained in this final volume ) now makes it a straightforward exercise to find his apologetic for the Georgia affair simply by looking under " Georgia " and " Hopkey , Sophia . " The reader can contrast Wesley 's expressed appreciation for the Moravians ' influence on his " conversion " ( Volume 18 ) with his frustrations over their quietism ( Volume 19 ) simply by referencing the index under " Moravians " and " stillness . " Helpfully , if the reader looks first under " quietism , " the editors then lead you to " stillness , " not expecting the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early distinctive characteristic of the Journals and Diaries carries through to the final volume , namely , to define the " character " of Methodism . As one might expect , by the time entries were made from 1787-91 , this is no longer an apology directed outward , but there is a recurring note in Wesley 's admonishments that many Methodists were not exemplifying the Christian character expected by their leader . On Thursday , May 3 , 1787 he writes : " I took leave ... and went on through a delightful country to Clonmel . At six , I preached in the courthouse . I was much surprised . I know not when I have seen so well-dressed and ill-behaved a congregation . " This perhaps means they did not hang on his every word as the eighty-four-year-old icon of Methodism had become accustomed . Wesley adds , " I was told , ' It was the same way that they behaved at church . ' Pity then that they do not turn Papists . The Church of England needs no such members " ( 22 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine clothes led also to hardening of the spiritual sensibilities , and the Methodists were chasing wealth rather than " fleeing the wrath to come , " the disposition he cherished the most , as noted on the facing page about parishioners at Cork ( 23 ) . It is not the case that these minatory comments are missing in earlier journal entries , but in these pages there is hardly a positive commendation that is not overmatched by negative observations like , " What wonder if all the people were grown dead as stones " ( 26 ) . I previously have not read all the Journals looking for these observations , but it is striking how often in the pages we encounter the admonition : " I exhorted to go on to perfection " ( 52 ) . Wesley does not entirely forsake the Methodist apologetic in the later Journals , but it is my estimation that from 1778 onward the pages of The Arminian Magazine are his venue for this apologetic . Wesley is deeply concerned about the spiritual vitality of his Methodists , and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admonish , correct , and supervise them : " The old murderer is restrained from hurting me , but it seems , he has power over my horses " ( 31 ) . <p> As in the previous installments , Wesley does not hesitate to report what he allows to be God 's providences , whether they be the miraculous saving of souls fleeing the wrath to come or healing those whom neither his remedies nor the physicians ' could cure . The testimony of Mr. Kingford at Canterbury is unusual only in the level of detail Wesley records : <p> Seven years ago I so entirely lost the use of my ankles and knees that I could no more stand than a newborn child . Indeed , I could not lie in bed without a pillow laid between my legs , one of them being unable to bear the weight of the other . All the advice I had profited me nothing .... At bath I sent for a physician , but before he came as I sat reading the Bible , I thought , " Asa sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Chron. 16:12 but God can do me more good than any physician . Soon after ... rising up , found I could stand . Being much surprised , I walked several times about the room . Then I walked into the square and afterwards on the Bristol road . And from that time , I have been perfectly well . <p> The daily diaries deciphered by Heitzenrater are a completely different genre than the preaching records , social and spiritual commentary of the journal entries . Diary entries note his rising at 4:00 a.m. and end with evening prayers at 9:30 p.m . Typical is his entry for Friday , January 5 , 1787 the numbers represent the time of day : <p> 4 Prayed ; read Dr. Hunter ! 12 The family . 1 Prayer . 2:15 Dinner , necessary talk religious ) , prayer ; Hunter . 5 Tea , religious talk ; prayed . 6 Prayed ; Hunter ; supper , religious talk , prayer . 9:30 . <p> While entries of this type appear rather mundane and unhelpful , references like " read Dr. Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell us what Wesley was reading at the time he was engaged in various conversations and polemics . In this case , we find an entry in the Journal for Friday , January 5 , 1787 , that reads , " in the vacant hours of the following days , I read Dr. Hunters Lectures . " The footnote tells the reader that this is Henry Hunter , and that his book is Sacred Biography ; or , The History of the Patriarchs . Even though the Journals omit names of daily conversation and dinner partners , these are included in the diary entries . The cumulative effect of these diary entries is a much more detailed picture of Wesley 's life . They are like the pixels in a digital image ; the more you have the clearer the image . <p> Some remarks are necessary about the detailed footnotes and the Bibliographical Index . The notes provide the reader insight into Wesley 's sources , those noted by him and those silently quoted or plagiarized ! Scriptural references are provided for citations as well as clear scriptural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traveling companions , hosts , and hecklers are given in adequate detail , and other references are made to sources that provide more information . The Bibliographical Index is equally precise . If Wesley mentions reading a piece or refers to it , or if the editors utilize a secondary source , these are all found with full bibliographical information , ( 397-505 ) . And this is followed by a comprehensive " Index to Scriptural References " ( 507-43 ) indexed in canonical order with cross-references to every volume and page on which the scriptural text or reference Occurs . <p> It is difficult to avoid overly praising these seven volumes , and especially this last one , which makes all of them eminently useful to the historian and the interested casual reader as well . Their completion is truly a landmark in Wesleyan Studies . <p> By W. Stephen Gunter , Candler School of Theology , Emory University <p> 
@@4157941 The cultural material in interwar periodicals of protest is a vital site of information regarding the complex history of Canada 's early-twentieth-century " woman question . " It also has much to tell us about the tangled history of the welfare state in Canada and its relation to women 's discourses of reform , which might seem surprising , given that the magazine of interest here , The Woman Worker , was published between 1926 and 1929 by an affiliate of the Communist Party of Canada ( CPC ) .1 Yet , as later Communist periodicals such as Masses ( 1932-1934 ) and the Daily Clarion ( 1936-1939 ) attest , the CPC and its affiliates made significant contributions to nascent ideas about the welfare state in modern Canada . This is particularly true of the periods during which the CPC was engaged in " united " and " Popular Front " initiatives , through the 1920s and during the latter half of the 1930s , for example.2 Nonetheless , what Dennis Guest calls the " largely unrecorded history of attempts to introduce citizen participation ' into policy making and administration " ( 85 ) that is embodied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far left ) has not played much part in shaping narratives of the development of the welfare state in Canada.3 Less visible still is the role of women , and particularly working-class and immigrant women , in this ephemeral history of " citizen participation . " Important groundwork has been laid : studies in labour history , such as Margaret Hobbs ' and Joan Sangster 's invaluable 1999 survey of The Woman Worker , have mined early- and mid-twentieth-century periodicals of protest for their political arguments and as sources for social history , and literary critics have begun the work of analyzing the literary content of and the role played by women editors and writers within these publications.4 This essay will build on this historical and literary scholarship to examine how the cultural material in the pages of The Woman Worker plays a crucial role in its performance of protest . Yet the object of social and political change is not constant in The Woman Worker , a fact that can be attributed to the political and cultural eclecticism of its creators and readers and that testifies to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodical was engaging . A contradictory iconography and discourse of womanhood , and hence of political change , runs through the periodical 's poetry and fiction : if what one reader calls the " rebel woman " gestures obviously to The Woman Worker 's Communist affiliations , its support of equal-rights feminism , and its fraught negotiations with a masculinist tradition of workers ' verse , a figure I characterize as the " little woman " suggests its equally frequent recourse to the ideologies of parliamentary reform and maternal feminism , as well as its use and revision of the Anglo-American novel of social reform . # The Woman Worker and Its Contexts # Labour historians have long appreciated the value of the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century protest press , and their work is a wonderful resource for understanding its contents . By the 1920s , the leftist periodical press was a central part of creative and political culture in Canada . The first major leftist periodical in Canada was the weekly newspaper of the Nine-Hour Movement , the Ontario Workman ( 1872-1875 ) , which featured a fair quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of trade unionism and political radicalism in Canada . According to R W. Watt , by the 1920s , these periodicals " emerged not merely from the dissident minority among the working classes , but from the respectable middle-class intellectuals who had earlier remained aloof " ( 467 ) . Literary and cultural scholars in Canada have , for many years , acknowledged the importance of the mid-twentieth-century " little-magazine " movement , but only recently have scholars interested in the cultural history of protest begun to examine periodicals that an earlier generation of scholars deemed unliterary and thus outside the movement . While foundational essays such as Ruth I. McKenzie 's " Proletarian Literature in Canada " ( 1939 ) and Watts " The Literature of Protest " ( 1965 ) mapped out literary histories of protest in Canada that brought previously occluded periodicals into literary-critical view , these scholars also clearly felt ambivalent about the aesthetic qualities of the " horatory chants and indignant diatribes " they were recuperating ( Watt 471-72 ) . Contemporary critics such as James Doyle , Caren Irr , Dean Irvine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Watt , and find historical and cultural interest in the interwar leftist periodical press in Canada , particularly the press of the troubled 1930s and publications such as Masses and New Frontier ( 1934-1936 ) . Irvine and Rifkind follow trends in the new modernist studies and cultural studies ( for instance , in the work of Michael Denning and Cary Nelson ) and seek to validate Canada 's early-twentieth-century protest press by incorporating its experiments into the modernist fold . Indeed , in his history of women 's participation in Canada 's modernist " little magazine " movement , Irvine insists on the inclusion of interwar leftist publications such as The Woman Worker , claiming that despite its origins in the CPC newspaper The Worker ( 1922-1936 ) , its " typical little magazine format " renders it an example of a category that he modifies to include " those non-commercial literary , arts , and cultural-interest magazines whose editors facilitated and participated in the construction of a magazine culture for their contributors and readers--but not , primarily , for profit " ( 195 , 16 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literary modernisms arrival in Canada does not fully explain the literary , aesthetic , and political eclecticism of a periodical like The Woman Worker . # Left of such well-known progressive periodicals as the Canadian Forum ( 1920-2000 ) , numerous serial publications flourished in the 1920s ; The Woman Worker was one of them . The Woman Worker was published by the Toronto-based Canadian Federation of Women 's Labor Leagues ( CFWLL ) . Although Women 's Labor Leagues in Canada predate the First World War , these groups assumed a new organizational structure in the wake of the creation of the CPC in 1921.5 At the urging of the International Women 's Secretariat of the Communist International ( Comintern ) , the CPC set up a Women 's Department in 1924 and began to demonstrate a new " measure of sympathy for women 's particular oppression " ( Sangster 27-32 ) . This Department strove to centralize the scattered WLL movement under the Toronto-based CFWLL--a not inconsiderable task , given the mixed heritage of the movement in British WLLs and the Finnish " sewing circles " attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the ethnic diversity and regionally specific political priorities of these groups ( Hobbs and Sangster 8-9 ; Sangster 45-52 ) . Florence Custance was the national secretary of the CFWLL , and she became editor of The Woman Worker when it was launched as an organizational tool from an office at 211 Milverton Blvd. in Toronto in 1926.6 Modest in appearance but professionally printed by the Sutherland Printshop in Toronto , devoid of colour save the muted green front and back cover , small in stature ( just shy of twenty-four centimetres tall and sixteen centimetres wide ) , and almost entirely without images , the sixteen-page Woman Worker was antithetical in every way to the large-format , mass-circulation magazines with glossy paper and full-page illustrations that became so popular in the first decades of the twentieth century.7 It did , however , share a ten-cent price tag with its mass-market peers , such as Canadian Home Journal ( 1896-1958 ) . The Woman Worker attempted to reach readers who were bombarded by the visual pleasures of such periodicals as Canadian Home Journal , Mayfair ( 1927-1961 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some League members , such as the women who attended a 1926 miners ' picnic in Blairmore , Alberta , compared it unfavourably to its more colourful counterparts.8 # As a leftist periodical published by and for women , The Woman Worker represents a significant first in Canadian history : its contemporaries on the left--Holos Robitnytsi ( 1922-1924 ) and Robitnysia ( 1924-1937 ) , which were published by the Women 's Section of the United Labor-Farmer Temple Association--were edited by men , and more general attempts in the socialist periodical press to include women 's voices or to address their specific concerns were generally confined to " women 's columns " ( Hobbs and Sangster 8 ) . The Woman Worker began as such a column in 1924-- " The Working Women 's Section " of the CPC paper The Worker . If this initial effort in many ways anticipates the politicized character of its progeny , later women 's columns in CPC publications , such as the " With Our Women " column that ran during the 1930s in The Worker ( later called the Daily Clarion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political activists and more about their identities as homemakers who might be seeking recipes , housekeeping advice , and dressmaking patterns . Columns such as " With Our Women " spoke to working-class women by adapting but not fundamentally challenging the conception of women in new forms of mass media , such as mass-circulation magazines and movies . For example , in the 5 February 1936 issue of The Worker , the editor of " With Our Women , " Anne Smith , offers the column 's typical fare : a pattern for a suit " to brighten up the wardrobe , " a recipe for potato soup , and tips for removing white rings on wooden furniture ( 4 ) . Somewhat ironically , Beatrice Ferneyhough 's contribution to this column on 16 May 1936 laments the lack of a socialist magazine for working-class , Canadian women who must content themselves with the " nauseous gushings " of mass-market magazines ( 6 ) ; that Ferneyhough does not refer directly to the example set by The Woman Worker in the 1920s speaks to the marginal place that the CFWLL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPC. # The Woman Worker demonstrates an entirely different conception of its female reader than one finds in either the mass-market women 's magazines of the period or the women 's columns of the leftist press , distance made this clear in the first issue ( July 1926 ) , with her declaration that the periodical would " not contain fashions and patterns , and we are leaving recipes for cooking to the cook book " ( " Success " 33 ) . Like the WLLs themselves , which often formed book discussion groups and organized lectures , The Woman Worker took as its mission the education of its readers . Moreover , like Maurice Spector , the editor of the CPC paper The Worker , Custance was " prepared to acknowledge the promotion of literary culture as part of the papers responsibilities , " following the priority granted to the arts in post-revolutionary Russia , where a " dogmatic party line " concerning artistic production had not yet been drawn ( Doyle 62-63 ) . In each monthly issue , readers of The Woman Worker were treated to editorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a short story , poem , or book review ; and regular , frequently reader-authored features such as " Our Labor Leagues at Work , " " Our Educational Page , " " Notes and Happenings , " " Questions We Are Asked , " " Our Letter Box , " and " Shop and Factory Life . " Despite the fact that The Woman Worker declared itself , on the final page of every issue , in the service of " all working women , whether they work in the factory , at home , or in office , " the Leagues themselves , where most of the periodical 's readers were generated , " never brought in substantial numbers of wage-earning women " ( Hobbs and Sangster 10 ) . It is therefore striking that Custance chose not to repeat or adapt for working-class women the messages of the rapidly proliferating mass-circulation magazines that were aimed at North American housewives ; rather , she offered a political alternative that emphasized above all else the importance of unionization to working-class women and their families . # " Rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultural politics of The Woman Worker is the division in early feminist thought that historians identify as the split between equal-rights feminism and maternal ( or social ) feminism . If the first " held that women were entitled by right of their common humanity to equal rights with men , " the latter , which emerged from the late-nineteenth-century North American reform movement , " held that women were fundamentally different from men , and thus deserved access to specific rights ( such as the vote ) because they had by nature and by training ' maternal ' virtues such as compassion , self-control , nurturance , compromise , and moral purity " ( Dean 59 ) . As Misao Dean points out , this difference was not particularly visible in Canada 's first wave of feminism ( because equal-rights feminism was associated with US-American republicanism and because of other conservative influences in English-Canadian thought ) ( 119 , n. 4 ) ; however , analysis of The Woman Worker demonstrates that equal-rights arguments strongly influenced WLL discourse . For example , references to the new forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the legalization of abortion , the acceptance of civil marriage , an amended family law code that established women 's equal status in marriage ) are abundant in the pages of The Woman Worker.9 Somewhat paradoxically , these exaltations of equal rights are often articulated alongside the maternal-feminist arguments that the middle-class counterparts of the WLLs--the Women 's Christian Temperance Union , the Young Women 's Christian Association , and the National Council of Women--embraced. # Two figures who , in various guises , populate the pages of the periodical , illustrate perfectly the contradiction between equal-rights feminism and its maternal counterpart : the first , the " rebel woman , " is militant , unabashed in her demands for revolutionary change , a proponent of equal rights for men and women , and is almost never characterized as a mother ; the second , a figure I call the " little woman , " is a suffering mother who either struggles to make ends meet on her husband 's wage or is forced into " wage slavery , " suffers from poor health due to poverty and frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two figures demonstrate the ambivalent and sometimes contradictory feminist politics of The Woman Worker--a politics that must be understood in relation to several key related contexts : the " peripheral status of the woman question within the Party " ( Sangster 52 ) ; the diverse membership and relative local autonomy of the WLLs ; and the " united front " strategy of the periodical , which frequently led to collaboration with middle-class women 's reform organizations ( 4445 ) . Although Custance was a staunch Communist supporter and important party member , not all of the local leagues or their members reflected her radical political commitments , and there remained , throughout the existence of the League , " some tension between the firm Communist leadership provided by the Women 's Department and a more politically eclectic membership " ( Hobbs and Sangster 9 ) . For example , the ethnic diversity of the Leagues--there were Anglo-Canadian , Jewish , Finnish , and Ukrainian groups , among others--reflected the many traditions of leftist organizing that were activated under the name of the CF WLL , all of which brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " # I take the phrase " rebel woman " from the April 1928 issue of The Woman Worker , in which Custance reminds readers that she is seeking an image for the cover page . She notes that " our Rebel Woman " sent in a submission that " shows a working woman dressed as a soldier--with gun in hand--ready for action . " Custance s response is playful and approbatory : " But since we are not allowed to send pictures which depict violence through the mail , we shall be compelled to keep the picture in storage for the time being . It is far too good to be destroyed " ( " This Would Kill " 5 ) .10 Literally invisible to readers but evoked with a paradoxical mixture of humour and menace , the " rebel woman " was a militant , revolutionary figure who could not circulate easily in 1920s Canada ; nevertheless , she had a crucial function in the periodical . The CPC and the CFWLL viewed The Woman Worker as an " important counterweight " to the influence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewives ( Hobbs and Sangster 10 ) ; the " rebel woman " was perhaps the heaviest stone in this counterweight. # The figure of the " rebel woman " is particularly visible in the poetry that appeared in the pages of The Woman Worker . The ubiquity of this figure in the periodical 's poetry is not surprising , given the function poetry assumed in other leftist periodicals from the 1920s . Analyzing literary and cultural material in the CPC 's periodicals The Worker and Young Worker ( 1924-1936 ) , Doyle observes that contributors in the 1920s " seemed to find poetry more suitable than fiction to the expression of the positive aspects of the revolutionary struggle " ( 72 ) . Indeed , poetry appears more commonly than fiction in the pages of The Woman Worker , particularly after May 1927 , when a new column , " Shop and Factory Life , " largely displaced short fiction with " true " tales from shop and factory floors . As in many Canadian socialist periodicals from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries , creative content was often reprinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist writers in the 1920s ? continued , like their radical predecessors , to owe more to nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century British , Canadian , and US traditions than to the Russian Revolution and its aesthetic reverberations , " largely because socialists in Canada had little access to the aesthetic debates of post-revolutionary Russia until the 1930s ( Doyle 63-64 ) . Nonetheless , contributors to The Woman Worker had a rich " revolutionary chorus " of leftist songs and ballads from which to draw poetic inspiration . " One note in this chorus that seems especially important in the making of the " rebel woman " is US-American labour activist Joe Hill 's " The Rebel Girl " ( 1911 ) , which was a key text in the interwar , leftist repertoire of song . Hill was a popular songwriter for the Industrial Workers of the World , and " The Rebel Girl " announces the importance of women to revolutionary action : # That 's the Rebel Girl , that 's the Rebel Girl ! To the working class she 's a precious pearl . She brings courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've had girls before , but we need some more In the Industrial Workers of the World , For it 's great to fight for freedom With a Rebel Girl . ( 293 ) # While Hill 's " Rebel Girl " becomes a woman in The Woman Worker 's invisible icon , this insistence is not followed through in the periodical 's poetry , which often leaves the rebel figure deliberately unmarked in terms of gender , a fact that suggests the discomfort with which WLL members attempted to adopt the leftist " revolutionary chorus " as their own . # " A Rebel , " reprinted in The Woman Worker ( January 1927 ) from the Glasgow Forward ( " sent in by a reader of The Woman Worker " ) , offers a particularly good example of the optimistic , militant verse in the periodical that urged women to revolutionary action . Using the ballad stanza , which has deep roots in folk culture and masculine , working-class traditions of song , " A Rebel " exploits the well-known rhythm of alternating iambic tetrameter and iambic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker , who urges his or her silent auditor to action : # The time is ripe for action , Bill , Let 's stand together , true , And move to take the wealth we make , Shall we--me and you ? ( 13 ) # The speaker of " A Rebel " may offer a verbal corollary to the image submitted to The Woman Worker by " our Rebel Woman , " but the speaker 's gender is unclear , which may be the reason the poem was reprinted in The Woman Worker , where its ambiguity strongly suggests a woman speaker apostrophizing her meek mate . The ballad form of " A Rebel , " however , was a staple of popular workers ' verse for centuries in western Europe and North America , and the poem 's gender ambiguity can not eclipse the strong male tradition it exists within . Transposing the ballad to Canadian contexts , versifiers such as T. Phillips Thompson ( in his 1892 Labor Reform Songster ) and , somewhat later , Dawn Fraser ( whose pre-war ballads were collected in Songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 1919 ) were important figures in Canada 's late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century tradition of workers ' poetry . This was a resolutely male tradition , despite the presence of some female voices , such as that of Marie Joussaye.12 # Other poems sent to the periodical by readers from the WLLs complement the revolutionary optimism of " A Rebel . " " A May Day Tribute " ( May 1928 ) , for example , critiques the doctrine of Christian meekness and figures the inexorable coming of the revolution , again in the familiar rhythm of iambic tetrameter and with a dramatic nod to the international left in its concluding line : # It comes--O mighty , onward , surging force No earthly power can stay thy course From that inevitable meeting place Of uprising workers of every race All barriers shall be swept away Or thrown aside to rot-decay With Victory at last we 'll Hail THE WORKERS'INTERNATIONALE !

The employment of the first-person plural as a metonym for the international left is a strategy common to the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century male tradition of workers ' verse . The production of poems such as " A Rebel , " " A May Day Tribute , " and " Courage " in the pages of a periodical destined for women readers widens this collective " we " to include women , but the poems do not specifically apostrophize them . Contributors to The Woman Worker were clearly hesitant to employ verse as a form of protest specific to women 's experiences , probably because of the weight of the male tradition of workers ' poetry and song . Moreover , this tradition was amplified in its masculinism during what Ian McKay calls Canadian socialisms " second formation " ( 1917i935 ) " when a " tough-minded military language " and iconography permeated the leftist press ( 94 ) . # However , the ballad form was turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Woman Worker .

( 13 ) # Given the frequent attention devoted in The Woman Worker to the exploitation of young working " girls " and the dangers of the " white slave trade " and prostitution generally , this ballad , which speaks in the voice of a prostitute who wants to know why she should not " live on their wealth / As price of their desire ? " is remarkable . Further evidence of the fact that " Prostitutes " is pushing the limits of the speakable is the author 's means of self-identification ; like many contributors to The Woman Worker , " A Reader " prefers to remain anonymous . # Of course , the gender ambiguity of initials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courage " were actually authored by female readers . Indeed , the most frequent contributor of poetry to The Woman Worker was a man who did not belong to a local WLL--Robert Whitaker , the well-known British-American socialist , writer , and Baptist minister from La Crescenta , California . Unlike many of the contributions to The Woman Worker , Whitaker s work is signed with his full name and his place of residence . Only one of Whitaker s eight poems echoes the discourse of the " Rebel Woman " : like " Prostitutes , " " The First Stone " ( February 1929 ) employs a first-person , female speaker who condemns the hypocrisy of those male clerics and lawyers who " sell " their " brains " but condemn her work as illegal ( 8 ) . Almost all of Whitaker s other poems rely on male speakers and the figure of universal brotherhood in order to communicate a desire for worldwide socialism . Whitaker s dominant presence in The Woman Worker suggests its editor 's desire to connect the publication to a more international socialist community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the male voice with verse as a form of protest , and the possibility that the periodical had difficulty attracting poetic contributions from Canadian WLL members . Indeed , the regular column " Our Labor Leagues at Work " never cites the writing of fiction and poetry as one of the regular undertakings of the local WLLs. # The " rebel woman , " despite her powerful presence in The Woman Worker , was not alone . The most immediate evidence of this fact is the cover image , which first appeared on the July-August 1928 issue . Although Custance obviously preferred the " rebel woman , " she chose WLL member Aileen Hautamakis considerably tamer submission , which features a short-haired woman holding a book--symbolizing " KNOWLEDGE " --in her right hand , and a flaming torch--representative of " ENLIGHTENMENT " --in her left hand ( " Readers-Please Take Notice " 10 ) . This woman is reminiscent of the ancient figure of " Lady Justice , " who is often depicted holding a sword in her right hand and the scales of justice in her left . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far cry from her gun-toting counterpart . Custances compromise speaks to her desire to communicate with a broad spectrum of women-it is significant that the upheld book is not identified--as well as her intention to stay within the limits of legality . This tamer icon of womanhood was accompanied within the pages of the periodical by the " little woman " --a figure who constantly shadows her rebellious counterpart . The epithet comes from A. D. A. 's story " Modern Values Struggle " ( December 1926 ) , which follows the travails of a " little woman " a " poor little victim " of child labour who moves from the factories of England to an unnamed Canadian city where the prospects for a young , working-class family are dim indeed . The figure of the " little woman " is consistent in The Woman Worker : as in this story , she is hardworking , morally respectable , and thrifty but physically exhausted from excessive--often waged--labour . Indeed , her entry into waged labour is invariably the catalyst for greater troubles ; the waged work of married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful to family life and " an unfortunate burden , not a right " ( Hobbs and Sangster 39 ) . In keeping with this message regarding the need to safeguard women as mothers or as potential mothers , the final page of each issue of The Woman Worker ( until June 1928 ) announces the periodicals commitment to the " protection of womanhood , " the " care of motherhood , " and " co-operation in place of competition . " # While the " Rebel Woman " is prominent in the poetry published in The Woman Worker , the " little woman " more often finds her home in its short fiction . As was the case with the poetry of protest in the 1920s , leftist writers of short fiction in Canada , lacking access to cultural debates from Soviet Russia , tended to look to nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century US-American and British models for inspiration ( Doyle 63-64 ) . The variegated strains of the nineteenth-century , Anglo-American print culture of social reform exercised considerable influence on contributors to The Woman Worker . Narratives of reform were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries and had the added advantage of already being associated with women 's writing , even if they were likely tainted , in the eyes of some WLLers , by their frequently overt Christian mission . In their portrayal of endangered working women , many of the stories in The Woman Worker owe a debt to narratives of social reform such as Harold Begbie 's A London Girl ( 1925 ) , which was positively reviewed in the second issue ( August 1926 ) as a novel that encourages the reader to revile " those who set themselves to destroy the lives and beautiful bodies of young girls " ( 10 ) . Other stories , such as the anonymously authored " The Story of Ellen Kenealey ( A True Story from Life ) " ( July 1926 ) , depend on the didactic melodrama of some reform narratives in order to lend urgency and appeal to their messages concerning the dangers of working life for women in cities . In " The Story of Ellen Kenealey , " the eponymous protagonist is out of work , unmarried , aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via an internally focalized narrator : " Who was there to give her shelter or assistance when her last cent was gone ? No one . What would she be in the eyes of the law ? A vagrant " ( i2 ) . Desperate , Ellen commits suicide by swallowing carbolic acid . # Yet the short fiction published in The Woman Worker was not all sensational formula and didactic narrative intervention : in their daring foray into social realism and analyses of structural ills , they are striking examples of the realist fiction that was beginning to emerge in 1920s Canada . Contributors of short stories were , like Jessie Georgina Sime , writing a new Canadian fiction of working-class women 's urban experiences . As Carole Gerson contends , these experiences were , with a few exceptions , invisible in Canadian writing prior to the First World War ( A Purer Taste 140 ) . Much earlier than in Canada , according to Amanda Claybaugh , British and US-American reform narratives expanded the domain of artistic representation to include such previously invisible experiences , places , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons , factories , slums , and madhouses ; prostitutes , laborers , servants , and slaves " ( 6 ) . Such a widened view was clearly valued by contributors to The Woman Worker . A. D. A. , for example , lauds Elizabeth Gaskell 's Mary Barton ( 1848 ) in the April 1927 issue for its realistic portrayal of the " lives of industrial workers " ( " Mary Barton " 10 ) . A Victorian novel of social reform with a decidedly nineteenth-century interventionist narrative style , Mary Barton is also a pioneering example of realism for its topographical accuracy ; its evocation of the texture of daily , working-class life ; and its attention to the " regional specificity " of the Lancashire dialect ( Foster xii ) . A comparable realism that employs Canadian settings and idiomatic language appears in The Woman Worker in stories such as " A Price for Bread " ( February 1927 ) , " Something Wrong Somewhere " ( March 1927 ) , " The Spectre Named--Poverty " ( May 1928 ) , and " Compliments of the Season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials of working-class women without heavy-handed intervention from the narrator and without resorting to the improbable , sensational , or idealistic resolutions typical of the romance tendencies of many nineteenth-century reform narratives , particularly as these flowed from the pens of Canadian women writers such as Agnes Maule Machar.13 # Often the stories in The Women Worker are detached narrations of the everyday troubles of working women ; at other times , recalling the intrusive narrative didacticism of the earlier novel of reform , the narrators are distinctly interventionist , appraising structural problems underlying workplace misery , offering direct political commentary on the injustices the stories depict , and calling for legislative change . However , the didactic stories in The Woman Worker reject the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century emphasis on noblesse oblige and voluntary middle-class benevolence that is so often at the centre of what Claybaugh calls " one of the most common scenes in reformist writing : the investigative visit " ( 7 ) .14 For example , despite its invocation of the suffering " little woman , " A. D. A. 's " Modern Values Struggle " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reform narratives that precede it , call in a middle-class savior ; instead , the protagonist abandons her ungrateful family for work on a western farm and a relationship of " comradeship " with one of the farm 's male labourers . More commonly , the stories supplant the resolution proffered by a benevolent employer with calls for an active , interventionist state . In A. D. A. 's short story " The Shack Builder " ( September 1926 ) , a working-class housewife , Mary , is left without any means of support when her husband unexpectedly dies and she is denied Mothers ' Allowance because of her ownership of a meagre " shack . " The same authors " A Modern Virgin " ( January 1927 ) is a story that warns the reader of the sexual danger inherent in domestic work and advocates legislative solutions to the predatory tendencies of male employers . A. D. A. 's contributions to " Shop and Factory Life , " a column that contained " true tales " from the world of waged work , similarly promote government and legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1927 column , for example , the author tells the story of " Esther , " a recent Polish immigrant whose employers systematically underpay her . A. D. A. helps Esther file a complaint at the Minimum Wage Board and , although the author recognizes that unionization is a surer means of protection , she shows readers how to navigate the legal bodies that are ostensibly meant to guarantee certain standards in the workplace ( " Shop and Factory Life " 5-7 ) . It is in such advocacy of protective measures that one finds The Woman Worker engaged in the project of beckoning forth a strong welfare state.15 # In some cases , contributors of prose merged the " little woman " with her more militant counterpart , and stories like this are powerful demonstrations of the competing ideologies that shaped The Woman Worker . A. D. A. 's " We Visit the Mountain " ( October 1926 ) offers an account of a woman ( the first-person narrator ) canvassing her neighbourhood in Ontario on behalf of a labour candidate . After encountering various disappointing types , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel woman " ( 9-10 ) . This " rebel " immediately declares that , unlike those who precede her , she will cast her vote for " the man who can help the workers " ( 10 ) . She finishes her denunciation of capitalist oppression with a flourish : # In Russia the workers were compelled to take drastic action . I tell you , that is what will happen in Canada one of these days , and it may not be so very far off . Do not misunderstand me . I love Canada . I am not unpatriotic . I have heard that you people in the Labor Movement want to destroy our country , that you have no use for it . ( 10-11 ) # The narrator receives this speech with enthusiasm ; this " real rebel , " she affirms , " was figuring things out pretty correctly " ( 11 ) . The narrator then hastens to offer one correction : " we in the Labor Movement liked Canada so much that we wanted Canada for the only useful people , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities " ( 11 ) . Other elements in the story echo this apparent coexistence of the discourses of revolutionary socialism and parliamentary legality : while the narrator champions the " courageous " Agnes Macphail ( Canada 's first woman MP and a member of the Progressive Party ) , she concludes with a militant apostrophe that urges women readers to remove " the chains of bondage " and to turn their " mountain of ignorance " into a " seething volcano of working class activity and consciousness " ( 11 ) . " We Visit the Mountain " thus merges the periodical 's familiar language of state protection with a didactic call for class struggle that anticipates the politics and aesthetics of the socialist realism thats emerged out of Soviet Russia in the early 1930s. # It is important to emphasize that the protective legislation and social welfare measures advocated through the " little woman " were treated in the pages of The Woman Worker as short-term compromises that would precede the working-class rule gestured to in the figure of the " Rebel Woman . " Yet understanding CPC-affiliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions rather than as contributors to a discourse of state reform that was ultimately absorbed in the postwar " passive revolution " does these groups and their political and cultural labours a historical disservice.16 Feminist literary and labour historians in Canada have for several decades emphasized the contributions of white , middle-class women to late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century discourses of reform17 ; less well-known is the fact that ostensibly radical women 's groups in this same period were employing literary discourse drawn from a diverse leftist-progressive spectrum as a means of articulating ideas that ultimately influenced welfare-state thinking . In so doing , these women were also rewriting the fin de sicle narrative of noblesse oblige and attempting to write the new forms of realism that so dramatically altered Canadian fiction in the modern period . Moreover , this analysis of the cultural material in The Woman Worker offers evidence of the fact that equal-rights feminism did , albeit hesitantly , find articulation in interwar Canada ; inspired by examples of women 's emancipation in post-revolutionary Russia that were trickling into the Canadian Communist press in this period , creative contributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their dependence on masculinist traditions of workers ' poetry made this undertaking a fraught one . Lacking ideological and ethnic homogeneity and struggling to assert a message rooted in class and gender identification , the diverse women of Canada 's WLLs nonetheless left a significant creative print culture of dissent that reminds us of the politically eclectic heritage of the welfare state , the convoluted emergence of women 's leftist writing via nineteenth-century forms , and of the contested nature of the " woman question " in 1920s Canada . # NOTES 1 This article cites the extant copy of The Woman Worker that is housed at the National Library in Ottawa . Margaret Hobbs ' and Joan Sangster s study of The Woman Worker , which reprints the first issue of the periodical in its entirety , may be downloaded from the website of Athabasca University Press . # 2 Prior to the " crisis " between 1928 and 1931 in the CPC , which was provoked by the Trotskyist-Stalinist split , the party pursued open collaboration with diverse elements of the labour movement , even the conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # 3 The role of the political left , particularly social democrats , vis--vis the development of the welfare state has been well documented , but the ways in which leftist organizations employed periodicals as a means of calling the welfare state into being require further examination . This is especially true of Communist periodicals because CPC organizations have not often been considered in relation to the history of the welfare state or of social democracy in Canada ( McKay 74 ) . # 4 For the work of literary critics , see , for example : Doyle , Irr , Irvine , Rifkind , and Rimstead. # 5 The CPC initially operated through a legal front , the Workers Party of Canada , but , as the result of a Comintern directive in 1924 , began identifying itself as the Communist Party of Canada ( Angus 91-102 ) . # 6 For further discussion of the circumstances motivating the formation of the periodical , see Hobbs and Sangster , 7-13 .

Custance 's " Important Notice " in the January 1929 issue indicates that she was editing once again in the new year ( 14 ) , but this was short-lived : the last issue of the periodical appeared in April of 1929 , and Custance died in July of that same year ( Hobbs and Sangster 12 ) . # 7 In the first issue , Custance relates that The Woman Worker first existed as a " feeble " mimeographed publication ; she is clearly proud of the professionally printed magazine that appeared in 1926 ( " Success " 32 ) . The first issue boasts a dark green cover of cardstock with black type ; all subsequent issues bear a lighter green cover of thinner , slightly glossier paper . # 8 See Mary Norths letter in the October 1926 issue .

@@4013141 In the rain forest of Ivory Coast , chimpanzees meet the challenge of life by hunting cooperatively and using crude tools <p> Tai National Park , Ivory Coast , December 3 , 1985 . Drumming , barking , and screaming , chimps rush through the undergrowth , little more than black shadows . Their goal is to join a group of other chimps noisily clustering around Brutus , the dominant male of this seventy-member chimpanzee community . For a few moments , Brutus , proud and self-confident , stands fairly still , holding a shocked , barely moving red colobus monkey in his hand . Then he begins to move through the group , followed closely by his favorite females and most of the adult males . He seems to savor this moment of uncontested superiority , the culmination of a hunt high up in the canopy . But the victory is not his alone . Cooperation is essential to capturing one of these monkeys , and Brutus will break apart and share this highly prized delicacy with most of the main participants of the hunt and with the females . Recipients of large portions will , in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives , and friends . <p> In 1979 , we began a long-term study of the previously unknown chimpanzees of Tai National Park , 1,600 square miles of tropical rain forest in the Republic of the Ivory Coast ( Cote d'Ivoire ) . Early on , we were most interested in the chimps ' use of natural hammers -- branches and stones -- to crack open the five species of hard-shelled nuts that are abundant here . A sea otter lying on its back , cracking an abalone shell with a rock , is a familiar picture , but no primate had ever before been observed in the wild using stones as hammers . East Africa 's savanna chimps , studied for decades by Jane Goodall in Gombe , Tanzania , use twigs to extract ants and termites from their nests or honey from a bees ' nest , but they have never been seen using hammerstones . <p> As our work progressed , we were surprised by the many ways in which the life of the Tai forest chimpanzees differs from that of their savanna counterparts , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved the most intriguing . Jane Goodall had found that chimpanzees hunt monkeys , antelope , and wild pigs , findings confirmed by Japanese biologist Toshida Nishida , who conducted a long-term study 120 miles south of Gombe , in the Mahale Mountains . So we were not surprised to discover that the Tai chimps eat meat . What intrigued us was the degree to which they hunt cooperatively . In 1953 Raymond Dart proposed that group hunting and cooperation were key ingredients in the evolution of Homo sapiens . The argument has been modified considerably since Dart first put it forward , and group hunting has also been observed in some social carnivores ( lions and African wild dogs , for instance ) , and even some birds of prey . Nevertheless , many anthropologists still hold that hunting cooperatively and sharing food played a central role in the drama that enabled early hominids , some 1.8 million years ago , to develop the social systems that are so typically human . <p> We hoped that what we learned about the behavior of forest chimpanzees would shed new light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even begin , however , we had to habituate a community of chimps to our presence . Five long years passed before we were able to move with them on their daily trips through the forest , of which " our " group appeared to claim some twelve square miles . Chimpanzees are alert and shy animals , and the limited field of view in the rain forest -- about sixty-five feet at best -- made finding them more difficult . We had to rely on sound , mostly their vocalizations and drumming on trees . Males often drum regularly while moving through the forest : pant-hooting , they draw near a big buttress tree ; then , at full speed they fly over the buttress , hitting it repeatedly with their hands and feet . Such drumming may resound more than half a mile in the forest . In the beginning , our ignorance about how they moved and who was drumming led to failure more often than not , but eventually we learned that the dominant males drummed during the day to let other group members know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermittent drumming about dawn was the only signal for the whole day . If As one male leans forward to feed on a dead monkey he has caught , left , his younger brother grooms him and waits his turn to eat . Below : Holding out his hand , one adult " asks " for a bone ; turning the monkey tibia toward the outstretched hand , the other shows his willingness to share . we were out of earshot at the time , we were often reduced to guessing . <p> During these difficult early days , one feature of the chimps ' routine proved to be our salvation : nut cracking is a noisy business . So noisy , in fact , that in the early days of French colonial rule , one officer apparently even proposed the theory that some unknown tribe was forging iron in the impenetrable and dangerous jungle . <p> Guided by the sounds made by the chimps as they cracked open nuts , which they often did for hours at a time , we were gradually able to get within sixty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves ( they fled if we came too close ) , but even so , the evidence left after a session of nut cracking taught us a great deal about what types of nuts they were eating , what sorts of hammer and anvil tools they were using , and-thanks to the very distinctive noise a nut makes when it finally splits open-how many hits were needed to crack a nut and how many nuts could be opened per minute . <p> After some months , we began catching glimpses of the chimpanzees before they fled , and after a little more time , we were able to draw close enough to watch them at work . The chimps gather nuts from the ground . Some nuts are tougher to crack than others . Nuts of the Panda oleosa tree are the most demanding , harder than any of the foods processed by present-day hunter-gatherers and breaking open only when a force of 3,500 pounds is applied . The stone hammers used by the Tai chimps range from stones of ten ounces to granite blocks of four to forty-five pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarity in the forest and are seldom conveniently placed near a nut-bearing tree . By observing closely , and in some cases imitating the way the chimps handle hammer-stones , we learned that they have an impressive ability to find just the right tool for the job at hand . Tai chimps could remember the positions of many of the stones scattered , often out of sight , around a panda tree . Without having to run around rechecking the stones , they would select one of appropriate size that was closest to the tree . These mental abilities in spatial representation compare with some of those of nine-year-old humans . <p> To extract the four kernels from inside a panda nut , a chimp must use a hammer with extreme precision . Time and time again , we have been impressed to see a chimpanzee raise a twenty-pound stone above its head , strike a nut with ten or more powerful blows , and then , using the same hammer , switch to delicate little taps from a height of only four inches . To finish the job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use it to extract the last tiny fragments of kernel from the shell . Intriguingly , females crack panda nuts more often than males , a gender difference in tool use that seems to be more pronounced in the forest chimps than in their savanna counterparts . <p> After five years of fieldwork , we were finally able to follow the chimpanzees at close range , and gradually , we gained insights into their way of hunting . One morning , for example , we followed a group of six male chimps on a three-hour patrol that had taken them into foreign territory to the north . ( Our study group is one of five chimpanzee groups more or less evenly distributed in the Tai forest . ) As always during these approximately monthly incursions , which seem to be for the purpose of territorial defense , the chimps were totally silent , clearly on edge and on the lookout for trouble . Once the patrol was over , however , and they were back within their own borders , the chimps shifted their attention to hunting . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . Traveling in large , multispecies groups , some of the forest 's ten species of monkeys are more apt than others to wind up as a meal for the chimps . The relatively sluggish and large ( almost thirty pounds ) red colobus monkeys are the chimps ' usual fare . ( Antelope also live in the forest , but in our ten years at Tai , we have never seen a chimp catch , or even pursue , one . In contrast , Gombe chimps at times do come across fawns , and when they do , they seize the opportunity-and the fawn . ) <p> The six males moved on silently , peering up into the vegetation and stopping from time to time to listen for the sound of monkeys . None fed or groomed ; all focused on the hunt . We followed one old male , Falstaff , closely , for he tolerates us completely and is one of the keenest and most experienced hunters . Even from the rear , Falstaff set the pace ; whenever he stopped , the others paused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unmistakable noises of monkeys jumping from branch to branch . Silently , the chimps turned in the direction of the sounds , scanning the canopy . Just then , a diana monkey spotted them and gave an alarm call . Dianas are very alert and fast ; they are also about half the weight of colobus monkeys . The chimps quickly gave up and continued their search for easier , meatier prey . <p> Shortly after , we heard the characteristic cough of a red colobus monkey . Suddenly Rousseau and Macho , two twenty-year-olds , burst into action , running toward the cough . Falstaff seemed surprised by their precipitousness , but after a moment 's hesitation , he also ran . Now the hunting barks of the chimps mixed with the sharp alarm calls of the monkeys . Hurrying behind Falstaff , we saw him climb up a conveniently situated tree . His position , combined with those of Schubert and Ulysse , two mature chimps in their prime , effectively blocked off three of the monkeys ' possible escape routes . But in another tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of the hunters , Kendo , eighteen years old and the least experienced of the group . The monkeys , taking advantage of Falstaff 's delay and Kendo 's error , escaped . <p> The six males moved on and within five minutes picked up the sounds of another group of red colobus . This time , the chimps approached cautiously , nobody hurrying . They screened the canopy intently to locate the monkeys , which were still unaware of the approaching danger . Macho and Schubert chose two adjacent trees , both full of monkeys , and started climbing very quietly , taking care not to move any branches . Meanwhile , the other four chimps blocked off anticipated escape routes . When Schubert was halfway up , the monkeys finally detected the two chimps . As we watched the colobus monkeys take off in literal panic , the appropriateness of the chimpanzees ' scientific name -- Pan -- came to mind : with a certain stretch of the imagination , the fleeing monkeys could be shepherds and shepherdesses frightened at the sudden appearance of Pan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their flocks . <p> Taking off in the expected direction , the monkeys were trailed by Macho and Schubert . The chimps let go with loud hunting barks . Trying to escape , two colobus monkeys jumped into smaller trees lower in the canopy . With this , Rousseau and Kendo , who had been watching from the ground , sped up into the trees and tried to grab them . Only a third of the weight of the chimps , however , the monkeys managed to make it to the next tree along branches too small for their pursuers . But Falstaff had anticipated this move and was waiting for them . In the following confusion , Falstaff seized a juvenile and killed it with a bite to the neck . As the chimps met in a rush on the ground , Falstaff began to eat , sharing with Schubert and Rousseau . A juvenile colobus does not provide much meat , however , and this time , not all the chimps got a share . Frustrated individuals soon started off on another hunt , and relative calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small band of chimps acting on their own at the edge of their territory , does not generate the kind of high excitement that prevails when more members of the community are involved . <p> So far we have observed some 200 monkey hunts and have concluded that success requires a minimum of three motivated hunters acting cooperatively . Alone or in pairs , chimps succeed less than 15 percent of the time , but when three or four act as a group , more than half the hunts result in a kill . The chimps seem well aware of the odds ; 92 percent of all the hunts we observed were group affairs . <p> Gombe chimps also hunt red colobus monkeys , but the percentage of group hunts is much lower : only 36 percent . In addition , we learned from Jane Goodall that even when Gombe chimps do hunt in groups , their strategies are different . When Tai chimps arrive under a group of monkeys , the hunters scatter , often silently , usually out of sight of one another but each aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gradually close in , encircling the quarry . Such movements require that each chimp coordinate his movements with those of the other hunters , as well as with those of the prey , at all times . <p> Coordinated hunts account for 63 percent of all those observed at Tai but only 7 percent of those at Gombe . Jane Goodall says that in a Gombe group hunt , the chimpanzees typically travel together until they arrive at a tree with monkeys . Then , as the chimps begin climbing nearby trees , they scatter as each pursues a different target . Goodall gained the impression that Gombe chimps boost their success by hunting independently but simultaneously , thereby disorganizing their prey ; our impression is that the Tai chimps owe their success to being organized themselves . <p> Just why the Gombe and Tai chimps have developed such different hunting strategies is difficult to explain , and we plan to spend some time at Gombe in the hope of finding out . In the meantime , the mere existence of differences is interesting enough and may perhaps force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted theories propose that some three million years ago , a dramatic climate change in Africa east of the Rift Valley turned dense forest into open , drier habitat . Adapting to the difficulties of life under these new conditions , our ancestors supposedly evolved into cooperative hunters and began sharing food they caught . Supporters of this idea point out that plant and animal remains indicative of dry , open environments have been found at all early hominid excavation sites in Tanzania , Kenya , South Africa , and Ethiopia . That the large majority of apes in Africa today live west of the Rift Valley appears to many anthropologists to lend further support to the idea that a change in environment caused the common ancestor of apes and humans to evolve along a different line from those remaining in the forest . <p> Our observations , however , suggest quite another line of thought . Life in dense , dim forest may require more sophisticated behavior than is commonly assumed : compared with their savanna relatives , Tai chimps show greater complexity in both hunting and tool use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have six different ways of making them , compared with sixteen uses and three methods of manufacture at Gombe . <p> Anthropologist colleagues of mine have told me that the discovery that some chimpanzees are accomplished users of hammerstones forces them to look with a fresh eye at stone tools turned up at excavation sites . The important role played by female Tai chimps in tool use also raises the possibility that in the course of human evolution , women may have been decisive in the development of many of the sophisticated manipulative skills characteristic of our species . Tai mothers also appear to pass on their skills by actively teaching their off-spring . We have observed mothers providing their young with hammers and then stepping in to help when the inexperienced youngsters encounter difficulty . This help may include carefully showing how to position the nut or hold the hammer properly . Such behavior has never been observed at Gombe . <p> Similarly , food sharing , for a long time said to be unique to humans , seems more general in forest than in savanna chimpanzees . Tai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nuts they open , at least until the latter become sufficiently adept , generally at about six years old . They also share other foods acquired with tools , including honey , ants , and bone marrow . Gombe mothers share such foods much less often , even with their infants . Tai chimps also share meat more frequently than do their Gombe relatives , sometimes dividing a chunk up and giving portions away , sometimes simply allowing beggars to grab pieces . <p> Any comparison between chimpanzees and our hominid ancestors can only be suggestive , not definitive . But our studies lead us to believe that the process of hominization may have begun independently of the drying of the environment . Savanna life could even have delayed the process ; many anthropologists have been struck by how slowly hominid-associated remains , such as the hand ax , changed after their first appearance in the Olduvai age . <p> Will we have the time to discover more about the hunting strategies or other , perhaps as yet undiscovered abilities of these forest chimpanzees ? Africa 's tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction by extensive logging , largely to provide the Western world with tropical timber and such products as coffee , cocoa , and rubber . Ivory Coast has lost 90 percent of its original forest , and less than 5 percent of the remainder can be considered pristine . The climate has changed dramatically . The harmattan , a cold , dry wind from the Sahara previously unknown in the forest , has now swept through the Tai forest every year since 1986 . Rainfall has diminished ; all the rivulets in our study region are now dry for several months of the year . <p> In addition , the chimpanzee , biologically very close to humans , is in demand for research on AIDS and hepatitis vaccines . Captive-bred chimps are available , but they cost about twenty times more than wild-caught animals . Chimps taken from the wild for these purposes are generally young , their mothers having been shot during capture . For every chimp arriving at its sad destination , nine others may well have died in the forest or on the way . Such priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the economies of Third World countries any good in the long run , and they bring suffering and death to innocent victims in the forest . Our hope is that Brutus , Falstaff , and their families will survive , and that we and others will have the opportunity to learn about them well into the future . But there is no denying that modern times work against them and us . A young female , below , feeds next to a puddle .

@@5026341 # From the moment phonography was invented by Thomas A. Edison in 1877 , and certainly after the numerous technical perfections of the ensuing years , the phonograph became a much valued instrument , as well as a toy , that quickly found its way around the world . ' A box that could record and reproduce sound had been unimaginable . The new machine could be used in manifold ways , for amusement as well as for serious matters . The commercial function that Edison envisioned most was that of a dictaphone. ( 2 ) That the wax cylinders could at first not record more than two minutes of sound was a handicap , but technical improvements soon doubled that amount of time . Another initial drawback was the fact that the cylinders could not be copied , but this , too , was solved . # A year later , in 1878 , Edison published a number of possible purposes for his invention . Among the ten points that Edison enumerated , two were particularly relevant for scholarly and educational uses : " the preservation of languages by exact reproduction of the manner of pronouncing " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elocutionary teacher , or as a primary teacher for children , it will certainly be invaluable . By it difficult passages may be correctly rendered for the pupil but once , after which he has only to apply to his phonograph for instructions . The child may thus learn to spell , to commit to memory , a lesson set for it , etc. , etc. " ( 4 ) Linguists and anthropologists used phonographs until late in the 1930s . One and the same machine able to make a recording and then reproduce it had a great advantage in the field over the technically more complicated sound recording on discs to be played by gramophone , an invention that appeared more or less simultaneously with the phonograph . The manufacture of sound discs was much more complex and demanded a higher technical level than recording on wax cylinders . Once the Edison Home Phonograph , a self-contained instrument to be sold at an affordable price , was developed for the market in 1896 , the recording of sound came within the reach of a large public . # An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ahmad Rasim , an employee of the Turkish Imperial Telegraph Company , who in 1885 published a booklet with the title " The Phonograph , One of the Most Remarkable Inventions of Mankind , " apparently translated into Turkish from a European language . ( 5 ) It included a portrait of Edison and three images of an early phonograph , but does not attest to its use in a Muslim country . There is no discussion as to the permissibility of phonography. # For Islamic law scholars slightly over a hundred years ago , use of the phonograph was an entirely new subject . They approached this novelty by traditional methods -- finding precedents and applying analogy . Their purpose was to categorize the act of using this marvelous invention , this piece of wood that reproduced the human voice , as one of five qualifications ( ahkam ) of Islamic law ifiqh ) : obligatory ifard ) , recommendable ( sunna ) , permitted imubah ) , reprehensible ( makruh ) , and forbidden ( haram ) . Only when the jurisprudents have classified an act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a novelty . Quranic recitation is considered " divine music " ( 6 ) and more generally an act of worship . The conditions for recitation according to fiqh are ritual purity -- cleanliness of body and mind . Elaborate rules are to be observed by the reciter as well as the listener , for both reciting and listening promise a heavenly reward . ( 7 ) The Quran is for Muslims , as its name ( lit. recitation ) implies , the pronunciation of God 's word ; secondarily it is a holy book in written or printed form . This aspect of orality makes early discussions by Muslim jurisprudents on Quranic phonography even more relevant . ( 8 ) Some attention has been paid recently to the consequences of new technologies in the duplication of the Quranic text , but the legal aspects of this remain largely unresearched. ( 9 ) # When the Dutch Islamicist Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje ( 1857-1936 ) published an article in 1900 on Muslim legal opinion on the recording of sound in general and of the recitation of the Quran in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern . ( 10 ) At the time Snouck Hurgronje was based in Batavia ( Jakarta ) , where he held the influential post of official adviser to the Dutch colonial government on Arabian and Islamic affairs . It was his job , among other duties , to monitor new trends in the thinking of Indonesian Muslims , to report about these to the Dutch authorities , and to write official dispatches containing advice . These dispatches , most of which have been published , are still a prime source for the history of Islam in Indonesia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . ' ' At the time they were conceived , however , they had a practical purpose and a very limited circulation . Occasionally Snouck Hurgronje found the time to expand his research and work out its results in learned articles -- his article on the phonograph is a typical spinoff of his official remarks . ( 12 ) # Phonography in Islamic circles was never a subject that required Snouck Hurgronje 's official advice , but writings and fatwas on aspects of phonography were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the early authors on phonography , two were in fact acquaintances of his -- Sajjid Oethman ( Sayyid'Uthman ) and Abdallah al-Zawawi . The former probably offered the booklet that he published in 1899-1900 on phonography to Snouck Hurgronje ; the latter sent him a handwritten copy of his fatwa on the same subject in the course of 1908 . That document , which is not widely known , is herewith published and translated . # A favorable circumstance was that Snouck Hurgronje had a genuine interest in all sorts of technical novelties . He brought photographic equipment with him for his stay in Jedda and Mecca in 1884-1885 , and after the Egyptian officer Muhammad Sadiq Bey ( Sadie Bey ) he was the second photographer -- together with the Meccan physician Abd al-Ghaffar b . Abd al-Rahman al-Baghdadl ( 13 ) -- to record images of Islam 's holy city and its inhabitants , and the first Westerner to do so . Much later in life he chose to travel to the 17th International Congress of Orientalists in Oxford ( August 28-September 1 , 1928 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain eagerness for new technologies . But at the beginning of the twentieth century phonography had taken his fancy , not just to write about Muslim reactions to this new phenomenon , but also to embrace , play , and work with it for its own sake at his home in Weltevreden , Batavia. ( 14 ) # EARLY ISLAMIC WRITINGS ON SOUND RECORDING # The earliest known document on the use of phonography in an Islamic context dates from 1899 . It is a fatwa , a legal opinion , issued by Sayyid'Uthman ( 1822-1914 ) in Batavia. ( 15 ) Sayyid TJthman was of HadramI origin , like so many Arabs in southeast Asia . He was a leading intellectual in Islamic circles , had many contacts with the colonial authorities , and exerted considerable influence by way of the stream of publications that came from his lithographic press . Some of these are still being reprinted . Inevitably , he was involved in many controversies concerning both Islamic law and the modus vivendi between Indonesian Muslims and the colonial authorities . In his fatwa he divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answers ( after a lengthy introduction with considerations of a more general nature ) : # 1 . Is phonography an honest profession ? Is reciting the Quran and a singing woman from the same box permitted ? Answer : If decency is guaranteed , it is permitted . # 2 . Are the sounds reproduced indeed the Quran ? Is there a reward for the listener ? Answer : No reward is gained , because the sound does not come from the mouth of a human being , and the Quranic sound that one hears from the phonograph is not produced by the human organ of speech . # 3 . If phonographic sound is not considered to be the human voice , may one listen to a phonographic copy of a strange woman 's ( ajnabiyya ) voice ? Answer : If the listening arouses lust it is forbidden ; if this is not the case , it is permitted . There is an analogy with looking at the shadow of a strange woman , or at her image in a mirror . # Sayyid'Uthman 's fatwa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elaborate one to silence his opponents . ( 16 ) Although he does not provide their identity , Sayyid ' Uthman 's lengthier fatwa is a vigorous rejection of the opinion and conclusions on the same subject of a Singaporean mufti , who was apparently more permissive and liberal than Sayyid ' Uthman . The Singaporean mufti held the following views : to listen to phonographically produced sounds is always permitted ; to listen to phonographically produced Quranic recitation brings reward ; prostration while listening to the sajda verses produced phonographically is recommended ; the engravings in the cylinder have the same legal status as script in a written or printed Quran. # A few years later , an Egyptian jurisprudent by the name of Muhammad Bakhit al-Muti'i ( 1856-1935 ) wrote a pamphlet on the subjects of phonography and insurance , two subjects that are only related by the fact of their modernity. ( 17 ) The author was a former member of the Egyptian High Court and would go on to have a distinguished career as Egypt 's Grand Mufti . He had already written two treatises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these had , so he tells us , aroused criticism from several sides , and in the present work he sets out to position himself better on the two subjects and to give a fuller explanation . This he does first in the form of twelve questions that are put in the mouth of a ( fictitious ? ) person and are then followed by the author 's answers . These answers gain in weight by their fatwalike appearance . The questions can be reduced to the following ten : # 1 . Can a wax cylinder of the Quran be considered the same as the Quran in book form ? # 2 . Does the person who plays the cylinder receive the same reward as the copyist of the Quran ? # 3 . Can the person who plays the cylinder be considered a reciter of the Quran ? # 4 . Are imperfections in playing the Quran a sin on the account of the reciter who was recorded , and are these repeated by repetition of playing , and is he rewarded if the performance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the phonograph real or just the likeness of a recitation ? This question suggests ignorance regarding the inner workings of the phonograph , which are then explained . Edison 's name is mentioned. # 6 . What about the entertainment character of the mechanical recitation of the Quran ? The author answers with an explanation of the serious applications of the phonograph. # 7 . What is the difference between the repetition of the Revelation by a machine and that by the angel Gabriel ? The answer explains the difference between lafz , ( the form , or sound of the machine ) and ma'na ( the meaning , or content of the Revelation ) . # 8 . Is a verse of the Quran incumbent on the believer when recited by a machine , as it is when recited by a live person ? The answer is that the only difference is in the speaker ( al-natiq ) , viz. , an intelligent one and an unintelligent one . Referencing Q 20:12 ( and also 79:16 ) , al-Muti'i finds a parallel when the prophet Musa hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of wood . ( 18 ) The author ably works out this parallel with reference to early Islamic discussions on the divine attributes , of which the divine word is one. # 9 . What about the fact that God 's word must be recited with emotion ( bi-hazn ) l The answer is that a phonograph has no feeling , but whoever listens to God 's word should feel the emotion , even when it is reproduced phonographically. ( 19 ) # 10 . What if the phonograph also reproduces the sound of the Gospel ? The answer is that it can only reproduce one recording at a time . Nobody can say that when God 's word is phonographically reproduced , this is not the Quran . When the Gospel is phonographically reproduced , then that is the Gospel to its people. # These questions and answers follow a refutation by al-Muti'i of an unnamed , harsh critic of both his treatises on the phonograph and on insurance , one of whose reproaches was that al-Muti'i had not given an adequate description of the phonograph machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a short description of the working of the phonograph is once more given . The other criticism concerns al-Muf'i 's opinions on insurance , mostly in connection with international commerce . The ensuing discussion , which quickly derails and shifts into a full-fledged theological discussion with a wealth of technicalities and intricacies , falls outside the scope of the present article . # A third early writing on the phonograph was a fatwa by the Meccan scholar of Maghribi descent Abdallah Muhammad Salih al-Zawawi. ( 20 ) Al-Zawawi first met Snouck Hurgronje in Jedda in 1884 , when the latter was on his way to Mecca where he would stay between February and July 1885 . Like his father , al-Zawawi was a professor in the Great Mosque of Mecca . ( 21 ) Upon being exiled from Mecca he traveled widely in Southeast Asia , in particular to the Arab Sultanate of Pontianak on the west coast of Kalimantan ( Borneo ) , and in the Middle East . During this time he looked after his business interests , inquired after resorts to treat his fragile health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this he eventually succeeded . He was killed during Ibn Sa'ud 's conquest of al-Ta'if in 1924 . In his lifetime he was an invaluable informant for Snouck Hurgronje and their long correspondence touches upon numerous interesting subjects . # AL-ZAWAWl 'S FATWA ON PHONOGRAPHY # In his letter to Snouck Hurgronje of 12 Sha'ban 1326 , al-Zawawi writes : You mentioned the arrival of my letter , although it contained nothing about the phonograph , you thanked me for that , but this , I mean your gratitude , is for something where gratitude is not due , and this is just the result of your virtue and your perfection . From it I understood that you have a special interest in what was written concerning the phonograph , so I asked my son to look for the draft version , and to do that urgently . He found a copy of the draft in his own poor handwriting , but for someone like you it is legible , and therefore I enclose it in this letter . I hope it reaches you , and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The text ( 22 ) of al-Zawawf 's fatwa follows : phrase omitted # phrase omitted # phrase omitted # phrase omitted # phrase omitted # phrase omitted # Translation # In the name of God , the Merciful , the Compassionate # There has appeared an apparatus that speaks with sounds , with singing , and all sorts of poetry , and it sings and it wails . On some of its tablets , ( 23 ) which are called cylinders , there appears recitation of the Quran and of the call to prayer , adhan . It has become commonplace in the suq , in gatherings of people , and in every cafe , and it is sold everywhere , most of its buyers being Christians , Mazdeans , and others . I hereby request an elucidation on its legal status when it speaks Quran and on the legal status of the cylinders from which the sound of the Quran is heard with the aforementioned apparatus , this from the viewpoint of veneration for the Quran , from the viewpoint of carrying and touching it with ritually impure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the recitation upon hearing from it a sajda verse , and likewise in connection with the adhan , or when this is not required , since opinions differ as to its ruling -- some are strict and some are more lenient in this respect . God , the Highest , has said : " Ask the followers of the reminder if you do not know . " ( 24 ) # The answer : # Praise be to God alone , and blessing and peace be upon him , after whom there is no prophet , and upon his family , his companions , his party , his regiment , and his army . It is known that the permitted is what God , He be praised , has permitted , the forbidden is what God , He be praised and exalted , has forbidden , and He is silent about other things , without being forgetful , but only because these were not asked about . It is known that this apparatus is something new , for which there is not yet an authoritative text as to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , that is , finality about something being forbidden or being permitted without an authoritative text is sinful . The preponderant adopted position among those who concern themselves with the principles of the law is that the basis of things is lawfulness , being permitted , and analogy ( the definition of analogy is the establishment of the likeness of a known ruling to another so as to compare the ratio legis ( 25 ) ) . A condition for its correctness is that there is a likeness between the compared object and that with which it is compared in what concerns the ratio legis and a number of contemporary scholars have given their opinions on this question . One allowed it without qualification , and made the matter easy , not considering the tablets on which the sound of the Quran is recorded as something that should be venerated . On the contrary , he said that it is permitted to use them even for ritual cleansing purposes . Another put it in every way in the category of the Quran , and yet another declared it unlawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean recording the sound of the Quran on the aforementioned cylinders , one of the gravest sins . To the writer of these lines it appears that the question can be divided into five questions , as you will see : # 1 . the discourse on the reciter , the apparatus that is called gramophone ; # 2. the discourse on the tablets , the cylinders on which there is the sound of the Quran ; # 3. the discourse on prostrating during the recitation , upon hearing a sajda verse from the loudspeaker ; # 4. the discourse on whether or not the listener is rewarded ; # 5. the discourse on whether or not the person who records his recitation on the tablets of the loudspeaker is rewarded , commits a sin , or neither . # The answer to the first question is that , as far as veneration is concerned , a ruling regarding use of the apparatus applies . When it is used in order to perform the Quran , the obvious opinion is that this depends on the aim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admonish by making it heard , or if there is another correct intention other than admonishing and preaching , as when he is using it for vowelization of the letters or for reciting or for any other lawfully permitted purpose , there is no reason to prohibit this , and he should be rewarded according to the aim and intention that he had . If his aim is to play and to indulge in amusement , as is often the case when listening to the aforementioned instrument , then it is forbidden and doing that should be considered a sin . I am afraid that whoever does this becomes one of those who have taken their religion in contempt and as amusement , and he should heed the words of God , exalted is He : " And leave those who have taken their religion for a play and an idle sport , and whom this world 's life has deceived , and remind them thereby lest a soul should be given up ... , " till the end of the verse . ( 26 ) Hence , as most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , it is best to prohibit the performance of the Quran with it , and thus it will only be used for what it was originally designed , that is for singing and the like . # The answer to the second question is that the cylinders on which the Quran is recorded should be considered , as far as the law is concerned , in the same way as tablets and the paper on which Quranic text is written , or as the leather with which a Quran is bound , because our veneration for the paper and the tablets , correction : ( 27 ) for the leather , the cover , and the boxes in which copies of the Quran are kept , is there all the time because of their relationship with the Quran , not because of the substance of the ink or the style of writing , that is , the writing of the letters in particular . What we nowadays write our copies of the Quran with -- there is no doubt that it is different from how it was done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is the question of miniature copies of the Quran that can only be read with a magnifying glass . These are without doubt venerated by every well-informed person . Because of all of what I have mentioned it seems that it is obligatory to pay respect to the tablets of the loudspeaker , that is , to the cylinders . This is incumbent on whoever knows about the existence of the sound of the Quran on the cylinders , because of the veneration with which one should treat the Quran . This includes the engravings that are in the aforementioned cylinders and there is nothing that prevents this respect being extended to generally accepted lines of writing , except that the latter are perceived with the sense of seeing , known only by the writer , whereas the former are perceived with the sense of hearing , and every listener can hear them , and these are more suitable . As to miniature Quran copies , the writing in them can only be seen with a magnifying instrument . ( 28 ) As for the tablets and the cylinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the " gramophone . " And that is why we are of the opinion that the application of analogy in this case is correct , because of the resemblance between the two compared items . Therefore it is incumbent on the person who knows that the Quran is recorded on the cylinders to treat them with veneration , just like the tablets and paper with Quranic text should be treated with veneration . As for touching the cylinders in a state of ritual impurity and to carry them in such a state , from the perspective of the law they should be treated in the same way as tablets and paper on which there is Quranic text . And if the tablets and papers on which is the entire Quran or a part of it are venerated , and it is forbidden to touch or carry them in states of minor or major ritual impurity , why then would the tablets and cylinders of the gramophone not be treated with veneration and would their being carried in a state of ritual impurity not be forbidden , despite the engravings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more worthy of being called writing than lines of writing because they are a natural writing that happens through the undulating of the air by the reciting of the words by way of the wellknown needle , which faultlessly repeats the speech as the reciter has produced it . As for the well-known writing by hand , it is commonly accepted writing which does not render speech naturally but by description and convention , and sometimes the writer makes mistakes and does not reproduce what is dictated to him . And sometimes the reciter does not properly reproduce what is written . Even if he is able to write it , as the receiver of the recitation he does not vowelize properly . That is why some legal theorists have said that the uninterrupted transmission of the Quran from one generation to another is characteristic of it , not through being reproduced . Thus , we can not say with certainty that our reproducing of this continuous Quran is identical to the way the Prophet , may God bless him and grant him peace , recited the Quran . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophet 's reciting had been preserved , then we would have certain knowledge about this and it would be considered as continuous . Veneration for the Quran is a duty for certain and to treat it with contempt is a grave sin , and leads to unbelief if it is done on purpose . # The answer to the third question : It is evident that there is no obligation under the law to prostrate when one hears a sajda verse from the loudspeaker of the voice of the reciter , because there is no intention here . The jurists have clearly said that it is not prescribed to prostrate upon hearing the Quran recited by someone who has no intention to recite , such as someone who is sleeping , and this apparatus is an inanimate being , and the quality of being inanimate prevails here . # The answer to the fourth question , namely , whether the listener is rewarded , is that if the listener listens with consideration , attention , understanding , and obedience , then he will be rewarded . Here there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an angel or a jinn , because the listener has the reward of his listening , and on the basis of that it is said that for listening to the Quran from the gramophone , I mean from the apparatus that speaks the voice of the reciter , the listener is rewarded if he listens well , and he is punished if he listens badly or if he takes the verses of God as play and an idle sport , as there is no difference between hearing from the mouth of a reciter or from the tube of the loudspeaker . # The answer to the fifth question , namely , whether there is a reward for the recorder of the recitation on the tablets of the loudspeaker or whether he is committing a sin by doing that , is that from all that has been mentioned before , it is evident that writing copies of the Quran and tablets and recording sound on the tablets share the same legal ruling . I mean that for the person who intends benefit and reward , there is a remuneration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , there is no remuneration ; on the contrary , he is punished , as the deeds are according to the intentions . My own opinion is that it is more suitable for the reciter that he not record his recitation on the aforementioned cylinders as sound of the Quran , in order to prevent it falling into the hands of people who are not serious and who act contrary to the religion , whereby lack of veneration for the Quran can occur and the recorder of the Quran is the cause thereof . God , praised and exalted is He , knows best . signed by Al-Sayyid " Abdallah Muhammad Salih al-ZawawI # SCHOLARLY USE OF SNOUCK HURGRONJE 'S RECORDINGS AND OTHERS # In 1906 Snouck Hurgronje repatriated to the Netherlands on his way to an influential academic career , but he sent his Edison phonograph to Jedda and Mecca , where numerous recordings were made . Most of these contain vocal and instrumental music but there is a modest amount of Quran recordings as well . # Instructions on recording were sent by Snouck Hurgronje from Leiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Batavia . This Arab of Hadrami origin was a shipping agent in the pilgrim transportation trade . His brother Jamal ( " the old Tadjoedin , " as he was called in the Dutch colony in Jedda at the time ) lived in Mecca and Jedda , and operated the phonograph according to the instructions that he received . Outside of the pilgrimage season there was plenty of time to indulge in scholarly projects , and Jamal was often sent on errands in the Hijaz . Copies of some of the instructions between the Tadjoedin brothers have been preserved : ( 29 ) Keep the apparatus clean and handle it with care . Keep it in its box . Keep the cylinders in their covers , also after the recording . Mention the name of the performer , or the name of the piece performed . Make twenty cylinders ( qawalib ) with Yamani singing . Make twenty cylinders with pieces by local artists localities between Mecca and Medina are mentioned . Make fourteen cylinders with recitations from the Quran , from the short suras , so that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cylinder . # Snouck Hurgronje 's recordings contain in all some sixteen hours of sound , which may constitute the oldest preserved sound of Arabia and Indonesia . One recording session was photographically documented . ( 30 ) In the mid-1990s the Phonogram Archiv of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna , under the supervision of its then director , Dietrich Schuller , digitized the wax cylinders . Both a rough and an edited version were made , the latter eliminating most of the numerous acoustic irregularities . In 1997 the edited digital audiotape was mastered on sixteen CDs ; there also exists now a compressed version in MP3 format on two CDs of the entire collection . Ownership of the cylinders and the digitized sound was formally transferred on November 6 , 1996 by the Leiden-based foundation Oosters Instituut to Leiden University , with Leiden University Library as the place of deposit for the sound archive . In this way the collection has become available for research . Snouck Hurgronje 's notes on some of the music scores and songs from Arabia are preserved in his archive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Although Sayyid'Uthman 's fatwa on phonography is proof that mechanical reproduction of Quranic recitings was known before 1900 , the Leiden recordings -- datable to 1909 -- seem to be the oldest preserved ones . They comprise slightly less than twenty-three minutes of Quranic recitation ( see the Appendix for a detailed listing ) . # A somewhat younger collection of Quranic recordings on wax cylinders was made in Germany during the First World War . These were made by imams among Muslim prisoners of war who were detained in German prison camps -- Senegalese soldiers who fought in the trenches of northern France for the French army , and soldiers from British India who were recruited by the British . German anthropologists used these Muslim prisoners as informants on Islam and for their research they made sound recordings , including of Quranic recitation , which were preserved . ( 32 ) # A third set of sound recordings dates from slightly later . When the Semiticist Gotthelf Bergstrasser ( 1886-1933 ) visited Cairo between November 1929 and January 1930 to study the recitation of the Quran , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snouck Hurgronje 's private sound collection , then still kept by their owner in his house in Leiden . Bergstrasser had recordings made , and copies of some of his wax cylinders eventually came into the possession of Snouck Hurgronje . Only recently ( 2005 ) was it publicized that part of Bergstrasser 's sound recordings and image archive had indeed survived the Second World War . ( 34 ) # CONCLUDING REMARKS # The Muslim jurisprudents with their heated discussions about all aspects of the recording of sound -- of music in general and the phonography of the Quran in particular -- have now fallen silent . The written sediment of all their thinking lies unnoticed in archives and libraries . Most wax cylinders are lost or at best preserved in damaged condition ; the reciters died a long time ago . It would be rare for a modern-day Muslim to ask whether reproducing recitation of the Quran is permitted since it is ubiquitous -- in the taxi , in the barbershop , in teahouses and restaurants , Quranic recital has become a familiar sound . One can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in airports and department stores at reasonable prices . Small audiovisual devices that show the written version in real time with the recitation are also on sale everywhere . If there still exist restrictions on the singing voice of the unrelated woman , the ajnabiyya , it is the continuation of a situation that already was in place long before Edison 's ingenious invention . # APPENDIX # Below is a survey of the fourteen requested Quranic recordings , plus one recording of the adhan , made for Snouck Hurgronje in the Hijaz between 1906 and 1909 and held now in the Leiden University Library : recording CD/track cylinder length in minutes Q l 5a/6 H22 2:26 Q i 4b/47 H16 2:29 ( partly ) Q l 2b/43 D18 1:40 Q 2:285-end 2a/2 C 3 2:24 Q 28:21-27 3a/l D21 2:31 Q 41:30-34 ? 3a/22 E16 2:47 Q 93 2a/7 C12 1:47 Q 94 3a/12 E8 2:11 Q 95 3a/12 E8 Q 110 3a/ll E7 2:03 Q 111 3a/ll E7 - Q 112 3a/ll E7 - Q 113 5a/6 H22 - Q 114 5a/6 H22 - adhan , 2a/23 C25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22:01 minutes # JAN JUST WITKAM LEIDEN UNIVERSITY # Authore 's note : An earlier version of this article was presented at the workshop " Corpus Coranicum : Exploratory Workshop into the Beginnings of the Text , " held November 3-7 , 2005 in Berlin , and later published in Dutch as " Fatwa 's over de fonografie van de koran , " ZemZem 3 ( 2007 ) : 82-95 , 139-40. # ( 1 . ) On the introduction of the phonograph in the European and Indo-European milieus of the Dutch East Indies , see S.

The meaning of ustuwana for wax cylinder , which strictly speaking can only refer to the phonograph , has shifted in modern Arabic usage to " gramophone record disc . " Al-Zawawi 's use of lawh is not unequivocal . He uses it to denote both " gramophone record " and the traditional writing slab . I have translated it as " tablet , " but its double meaning can not be maintained in the translation . Al-Zawawi also needs lawh for analogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with the heavenly tablet , al-lawh al-mahfuz , which contains the archetype of the Quranic text .

@@4003341 Mahmood Mamdani 's recent book , Citizen and Subject , examines the legacy of the bifurcated state in contemporary Africa . Under colonial rule , the full rights of citizenship were usually granted only to Europeans , while the vast majority of African inhabitants were recognized as subjects who therefore may have had " a modicum of civil rights , but not political rights . " 1 In French-administered colonies such as Gabon , this bifurcation was accomplished through the indigenat , the legal statutes that defined the civil status of the local African population in Gabon between 1910 and 1946 . Even though a small number of elites were able to obtain French citizenship , most Gabonese were subject to this authoritarian and restrictive system . The rights of African sujets indigenes to freedom of speech , association , and movement were severely restricted . The subjects were obliged to provide unpaid and often forced labor to the colonial state for public projects ; French colonial administrators also had considerable leeway in administering punishments for infractions , often imposing sanctions in arbitrary fashion . In 1946 the system came to an end when the Lamine Gueye Law granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen years a kind of African colonial citizenship evolved in Gabon in the context of an " ambiguous democracy . " 3 Growing numbers of Gabonese participated in an electoral culture that sent a Gabonese person to the French National Assembly and placed Gabonese representatives on various advisory , and ultimately governing , bodies. 4 Gabonese political elites were obliged to create a political system that catered to both a local electorate and to powerful French economic and political interests . Following independence in 1960 , French presence and influence in Gabon actually increased as the country experienced an extraordinary economic boom due to revenues from petroleum and mineral exports . Gabon 's relationship with France has been rightly described as neocolonial , as evidenced in part by French nationals ' full citizenship rights in Gabon until the mid-1970s . <p> The electoral culture that had been the most important arena for the " continuing series of transactions between persons and agents " 5 of the Gabonese state had , by the mid-1960s , given way to new instruments of citizenship formation , most notably the extension of modern education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues , however , that since independence it has been the participation of Gabonese urban populations -- particularly those of Libreville and Port-Gentil -- in mob violence against foreign African communities that has provided the central ingredient to the formation of Gabonese ideas of citizenship . This violence served , in effect , as a recurring ritual of civic expression that solidified a sense of Gabonese privilege and identity . Specifically , participation in this conflict both reinforced an evolving Gabonese national identity and a sense of entitlement whereby being Gabonese implied possession of a set of rights and privileges not obtainable by foreigners . Although the evolution of Gabonese national identity and citizenship are closely related , a focus on the maturation of the latter is essential to understanding the popular revolts against the government of Omar Bongo in the early 1990s . The rituals of street violence -- the most powerful instrument for expressing the claim to Gabonese identity and its accompanying rights -- were turned upon the state itself and upon the extraordinary privilege of Gabonese elites and French neocolonial interests . Now Gabonese citizenship no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could demand a political response from the Gabonese state to meet its growing sense of entitlement . <p> The connections between Gabonese political elites and French culture are intimate and of considerable historical depth. 6 This special neocolonial relationship has prompted critical commentary from Anglophone Americans that often betrays a historical tension between U.S. and French interests in Gabon. 7 The historian K. David Patterson saw fit to close his study of the nineteenth-century Mpongwe and Orungu trading polities by citing a 1971 speech by President Bongo that claimed Gabon 's relationship with France had been distinguished by an " entente and harmony which has never known a discordant note " -- this , despite the legacy of the Atlantic slave trade and brutal concession company rule in the opening decades of the twentieth century. 8 In Patterson 's view , " These words are more than ceremonial rhetoric ; similar conceptions of the past are widespread among the Gabonese and are part of the national myth . " 9 The anthropologist Michael Reed categorically states that " Gabon 's very identity is inseparable from France , " 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unjust " nature of neocolonial structures in Gabon as a step toward becoming " outraged at them . " 11 <p> An ironic aspect of the French legacy in Gabon is the link between recent political agitation there and the 1989 celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution . David Gardinier has suggested that this commemoration -- along with the breakup of the Eastern Bloc , a decline in the Gabonese economy , and a subsequent drop in living standards for the urban salaried classes -- led Gabonese to look critically at the excessive wealth and privilege that had accrued to their political elites during the country 's extraordinary economic boom from 1975 to 1985. 12 In this view , the revolutionary ideals of popular revolt helped to fuel the strikes and urban uprisings that rocked Gabon in the early 1990s . Gardinier further notes , " Focus on the rights of man and the citizen served to remind the Gabonese of the restraints on the exercise of such rights under the Bongo regime . " 13 The Context of Gabonese Citizenship <p> In focusing on Gabon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intend to deny the role of other transactions between the state and its inhabitants in the formation of Gabonese citizenship . Florence Bernault , for example , clearly demonstrates that the period of " ambiguous democracy " and the electoral culture that developed in the wake of French colonial reforms following World War II laid the foundation for postindependence notions of citizenship. 14 In the 1970s and 1980s , Gabon 's petroleum-fueled economic boom allowed the state to intensify the kinds of transactions it had with its citizens . By the early 1980s , nearly all school-age children had obtained some primary-level education , which facilitated the spread of French as Gabon 's common language and introduced students to the images and rhetoric of the Parti Democratique Gabonais ( PDG ) . Founded by Omar Bongo a year after he took power , the PDG was Gabon 's only political party from 1968 to 1990 and it completely dominated civil and nationalist discourse during this period. 15 <p> The economic boom accelerated an already well-established pattern of rural exodus as the inhabitants of Gabon 's sparsely populated forests flocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the petroleum industry ) and Franceville ( center for the mining industry ) . As a result , the great majority of Gabonese are now sufficiently urban based to assume their roles in the rituals of citizenship , since cities are the theaters where the state and the populace act out such rites. 16 Along with increased urbanization , the oil boom also produced greater revenues for the Gabonese government , enabling the state to become the single most important employer and , as one observer notes , " in the process recruiting virtually every adult Gabonese already in the modern sector to the State payroll or patronage trough ! " 17 These developments contributed to the growing sense of a national identity , as well as a sense of the rights and privileges that should accompany Gabonese citizenship . <p> At independence in 1960 Gabonese citizenship as both identity and entitlement was significant only for a very small portion of the population . The 1970s oil boom , however , created the conditions under which effective mass citizenship became possible as the huge influx of foreign labor ( recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect foil for construction of notions of mass citizenship . A shortage of labor has marked Gabon ever since its traumatic entry into the modern economic sector under French colonial rule . Beginning in 1842 , when French marines established their garrison in the Estuary region with the aid of Senegalese sailors , small groups of West Africans have worked in Gabon as colonial auxiliaries or have been involved in commerce due to a chronic domestic labor shortage . When opportunities for significant investment and development presented themselves in the 1970s , it was readily apparent that Gabonese labor would not be sufficient to accomplish such ambitious infrastructure projects as the construction of the Transgabonais railroad or the radical transformation of Libreville from a sleepy colonial town to a modern urban center . Thus , the Gabonese state initiated a vigorous campaign of foreign labor recruitment that resulted in a non-Gabonese population of approximately 100,000 ( close to 20 percent of the country 's total population ) by the mid-1980s. 18 <p> Despite the absolute necessity of a large immigrant work force , experts nonetheless recognized that a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 study , the French geographer Claude Bouet emphasized that the recruitment of foreign workers must be strictly controlled and these workers should not exceed 10 percent of the total population. 19 Recalling past hostility of Gabonese people toward African foreign workers , Bouet suggested that urban-based Gabonese in particular , though " not being xenophobic , often adopt a reserved attitude towards the foreigner more enterprising than himself ( an attitude , by the way , which is rarely manifested in encounters with European foreigners ) . " 20 <p> It is this attitude that the Bongo regime has effectively exploited to promote Gabonese national identity and citizenship . By strategically playing to what has become full-blown xenophobia , the Gabonese government has diverted popular frustration and anger during moments of political and economic crisis by targeting different immigrant communities . Charles Tilly has noted how " citizenship sometimes serves as a basis of collective action , including attacks on foreigners , demands for their expulsion , and calls for the denial of benefits to them . " 21 In Gabon , citizenship has been reinforced and more deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on various foreign populations beginning in 1962 and continuing into the 1990s . Although most of this activity has occurred in Libreville , the riots in Port-Gentil in May of 1990 seem to indicate a significant shift in attitude toward the " European foreigners " referred to above by Bouet . Libreville 's 1962 Congolese Riots <p> In 1904 , the capital of the French Congo was moved from Libreville to Brazzaville , which also became the capital of the federation of French Equatorial Africa ( Afrique Equatoriale Francaise or AEF ) when it was created in 1910 . Throughout the colonial period , Gabon , due to its timber industry , generated much of the revenue for the four-colony federation that consisted of Gabon , Moyen Congo , Oubangui-Chari , and Tchad . Considerable sums were invested in developing Brazzaville while Libreville languished in relative isolation ; this situation did not please Gabonese colonial elites or the Librevilleois , who had not forgotten their city 's once central position in the French colonial world . In the 1940s and 1950s , intense political activity linked to elections in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent mobs asserted their role on the Libreville political stage. 22 <p> An additional illustration of such tensions was a soccer match between the Gabonese and Congolese national teams for the Coupe des Tropiques in 1962 , which incited mobs of newly independent Gabonese citizens to unleash attacks upon the immigrant Congolese in Libreville. 23 The match , which took place on 16 September in Brazzaville , ended in chaos as the Congolese crowd of nearly 30,000 attacked the referee and threatened the visiting Gabonese team . When the Gabonese players returned to Libreville and recounted their experiences , the news spread throughout the city and mobs roamed " the streets beating , maiming and killing Congolese. " 24 Two days of rioting ( 18-19September ) left nine dead ( five Gabonese and four Congolese ) and approximately thirty people wounded . Hundreds of homes in the Congolese-populated Akebe neighborhood were burned to the ground . On 20 September , 2,700 Congolese nationals were expelled from Gabon on a steamship to Pointe-Noire . Upon their arrival , reprisals began against the relatively small number of Gabonese residing in Pointe-Noire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The sudden influx of more than 2,000 Congolese into a depressed national economy suffering from urban unemployment placed considerable strain upon the Congolese government . Consequently , Congo 's President Youlou was obliged to institute special taxes to support " les refugies du Gabon . " 26 In a pattern that recurred later , the expelled Congolese represented the " enterprising " African foreigners ( masons , carpenters , mechanics , plumbers , electricians , and so on ) that Gabonese citizens treated with " reserve , " if not worse. 27 Such conflicts led to a diplomatic rift between the two countries . Although both President Fulbert Youlou of Congo and President Leon Mba of Gabon asked General De Gaulle to intervene to resolve their differences , the French president declined. 28 Diplomatic negotiations chaired by President Ahidjo of Cameroon in November 1962 , however , then led to a reconciliation and the possibility for the expelled Congolese and Gabonese to return to their previous situations. 29 <p> The 1962 Congolese riots are significant in that they establish the pattern of " enterprising African foreigner " as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent acts . It is revealing that Mba reportedly explained these incidents as " the sequel to the AEF federation because Gabonese manpower and revenue sources had been sent to develop the Moyen Congo basin . " 30 At the time of Gabon 's independence , Mba had insisted upon the federation 's breakup so that Gabon alone would enjoy the benefits of its wealth . This notion of privileged access to the nation 's wealth thus became an essential element in the bundle of rights Gabonese people used to construct notions of citizenship . <p> Building upon real and perceived slights from their experience of the AEF federation , in 1962 , urban Gabonese made Congolese immigrants the target of attacks . At least one observer suggests that Leon Mba 's government cynically allowed the situation to develop : <p> It was obvious to us that the forty-eight hours of rioting had been allowed by the government , which had made little effective attempt to interfere with the mobs , to call out the police or military , or to protect the lives and rights of the Congolese minority. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congolese , the Gabonese inhabitants of Libreville exercised both their emerging national identity and citizenship rights in the most powerful and dramatic fashion imaginable . <p> The Gabonese coup of February 1964 -- which briefly removed President Mba from power and resulted in direct French military intervention -- was not the consequence of a popular uprising but rather of the actions of a handful of Gabonese military officers . In the aftermath of Mba 's restoration ( in which twenty-five Gabonese rebels and two French soldiers lost their lives ) , however , numerous incidents indicated the extent of popular discontent and frustration with the increasing heavy-handedness of the Mba regime. 32 Ironically , even though these demonstrations apparently did not contain strong anti-French sentiments , the Gabonese assistant secretary-general of the Francophone African and Malagasy Union , Germain Mba , resigned his position in protest following the French intervention , proclaiming : <p> Today , dozens of my compatriots have fallen , victims of French bullets , despite the fact that our revolution took place calmly . The restoration of Leon Mba and his incapable team by French paratroopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been rejected by the entire Gabonese people. 33 <p> The coup and subsequent French intervention were watershed events in Gabon 's postcolonial history and demonstrated the extent to which the French would protect the interests of the Gabonese political class . When Albert-Bernard ( later Omar ) Bongo took power in 1967 , he blamed the political malaise of the Mba government on the Gabonese multiparty system and the " tribalism " it engendered . He thus rationalized the creation of a single-party state dominated by his Parti Democratique Gabonais. 34 Bongo subsequently presided over Gabon 's economic boom and the arrival of tens of thousands of foreign workers into Libreville , Port-Gentil , and the smaller urban centers . By fanning the flames of xenophobia , he skillfully ( and cynically ) used these populations to not only deepen the idea of Gabonese citizenship but also to divert ethnic tensions that might otherwise have led to incidents of intra-Gabonese violence . <p> It is instructive to compare Gabon with the Congo in this regard because the latter has suffered enormously from interethnic violence. 35 Gabon 's large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent passions that develop in some modern urban contexts . It is here that state and citizen engage in the " connivance " or " intimacy of tyranny " described by Achille Mbembe , where " the masses join in the madness and clothe themselves in cheap imitations of power . " 36 Gabon 's advantage is that the targets for such violence are not " citizens " but inherently vulnerable " immigrants . " Moreover , Bongo has purposefully provoked antiforeign sentiment that has led to deadly actions . The Congo , on the other hand , has had no such " luxury . " The violence that has so profoundly marked its postindependence history has been organized around shifting conceptions of ethnicity among its own citizens , a much more complex and destructive affair . The 1978 Beninois Expulsion <p> The 1970s witnessed a massive influx of foreign immigrants to meet the growing labor needs of Gabon 's booming economy . Not all the immigrants came for economic reasons , however ; the largest foreign community in Gabon consists of some 60,000 political refugees who fled ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968-1979 ) in neighboring Equatorial Guinea . Some established themselves as independent farmers or agribusiness farmworkers in Gabon 's Woleu-N'Tem province . Most Equatorial Guineans , however , came to Libreville where their presence strained local services and added to growing xenophobia . Les Equatos came to be associated with manual labor and have been subject to attacks from Gabonese citizens , most notably during police sweeps in February 1978 . Their situation differs somewhat from other foreign populations because many of the Equatorial Guinean refugees are from Gabon 's most important ethnic group , the Fang , and thus have family and kin relations with Gabonese citizens. 37 <p> The combination of an economic boom , inflation in Libreville , and the control of food distribution in the capital by foreign commercial retailers led to a tense situation by the mid-1970s. 38 High food prices led to attacks upon foreign commercants based in Libreville in January 1975 , killing one person and injuring approximately twenty others . When the government responded with price controls , hoarding and food shortages spread throughout towns . In addition , Gabonese farmers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military was enlisted to create Gabonese commercial networks to demonstrate that " the Gabonese people know how to farm and how to do business -- they are not lazy . " 39 These tensions reached a crisis when a festering political feud between President Bongo and Benin 's President Mathieu Kerekou coincided with a decline in Gabonese economic fortunes in 1978 . <p> In preparation for the 1977 Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) summit ( Bongo being the OAU president from 1977-1978 ) , an estimated $600 million -- equivalent to three-fifths of the 1977 national budget -- was spent to turn Libreville into a modern urban showcase , and another $300 million was expended for the construction of Bongo 's presidential palace . The timing was poor , however , because the economy took a nosedive in 1978 and the government was obliged to implement austerity measures . Meanwhile , a political feud that began in January 1977 when a small group of mercenaries attempted to invade Benin to topple the Kerekou regime ultimately led to an explosion of violence in Libreville in July 1978 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials had played a key role in the attack upon his country , Bongo accused him of trying to sabotage Gabon 's hosting of the July OAU summit. 40 Kerekou countered that any African leader who attended the Libreville meeting was , in his eyes , a " traitor " ; Gabon subsequently banned Benin nationals from entering its territory. 41 <p> The feud continued over the next year , culminating at the July 1978 OAU summit in Khartoum where Kerekou reiterated his allegations in Bongo 's presence . The Gabonese president was furious , viewing the accusations as both a personal insult and as an affront to the integrity of the Gabonese state . Thus , the person of Bongo and the image of the state were now merged in the minds of many Gabonese citizens . Kerekou 's allegations were sufficient fuel to ignite violent attacks against Beninois residing in Gabon . In a telegram to the OAU chairman , Bongo stated that " the anger of an entire people , which has been controlled for a whole year , literally exploded after the verbal vulgarities and insanities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place on 21-22 July , resulting in the destruction of Libreville 's main market , Mount Bouet , whose commerce had been under the control of Beninois merchants . On 23 July it was decided that the 10,000 Benin nationals residing in Gabon were to be expelled , a decision that had consequences not only for food distribution but for other sectors of the economy and society as well ( especially education ) . A significant percentage of Gabonese secondary school teachers were from Benin , for example , and their departure led to delays in opening the 1978-1979 academic year . In addition , the government of Upper Volta ( present Burkina Faso ) opted to repatriate its nationals in the face of growing hostility toward foreigners. 43 Though there was an economic price to pay for these actions , the Gabonese state was able to avert more serious political unrest through an exercise in " citizenship promotion . " It was noted at the time that <p> Bongo denied charges that his decision had been motivated by the economic crisis in Gabon . However , unemployment had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of xenophobia is a familiar tactic in Gabon as elsewhere. 44 <p> A continuous loop has been established whereby the perceived economic entitlement of Gabonese citizens is threatened by economic downturn and the commercial activities of foreign Africans , which in turn creates political tensions . The state seeks to alleviate these tensions by allowing xenophobic violence that , through mass participation , reinforces the sense of entitlement until a new set of circumstances places these rights under threat . Ironically , although the expulsion of Benin nationals in 1978 ultimately strengthened Gabonese nationalist identity and citizenship , in the short run it resulted in more difficult material conditions for the average Gabonese person . " La Guerre du Football " : The 1981 Flight of Cameroonians <p> By the early 1980s , the economic outlook had improved due to a rise in oil prices and the discovery of new reserves , alleviating a panic that oil revenues were soon to disappear . But the elements of violence still remained : immigrant communities energetically working the Gabonese milch cow and tense Gabonese citizens feeling that some of their own rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in Gabon from 1982 to 1984 , I often heard Gabonese proudly refer to their country as being wealthy , reflecting their president 's comments that Gabon was like a beautiful young woman with many suitors . Some assumed that simply by being a citizen of Gabon one was entitled to a comfortable government office job at decent pay , and for a time the Gabonese state could almost guarantee this . But when economic reality set in and this basis for citizenship was undermined , political crisis and attacks on foreigners were never far behind . <p> The economy in 1981 was in a much better condition than three years previously , but concerns about inflationary prices for basic necessities still haunted the inhabitants of Libreville and Port-Gentil . Further , anonymous political tracts criticizing President Bongo and his family were circulated in Libreville in March . These were early signals of opposition political activity organized by the Mouvement de Redressement National ( MORENA ) that boldly burst upon the scene in November and December . This activity was encouraged by the election in May of Francois Mitterand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bongo regime . Partly in response to the distribution of these tracts , a new Public Security Ministry was created in April . Life in Libreville continued in a state of tension. 45 <p> Once again a football match led to violence . This time Cameroonians were the target , a community whose networks were said to supply almost 75 percent of Gabon 's food needs in 1981. 46 A soccer match between teams from Douala and Libreville held in Douala on 20 May was marred by fighting among the players . On 22 May the Gabonese daily , L'Union , published photos showing Gabonese players laid out on the turf , apparently injured. 47 The next day , Libreville mobs started to attack <p> the symbols of Cameroonian activity : markets , small bars and stores . At the central Mont-Bouet market , stalls went up in flames , the largest stores were looted . According to eyewitnesses , police were seen attacking and even looting . Students as well let loose and took part . In many quartiers , cars were in flames , especially " Cameroonian " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed in this rioting and that a number of Cameroonians were injured . The Cameroon government quickly made arrangements for the evacuation of its population as the violence spread to Port-Gentil and other urban centers . Within a few days , 6,000 Cameroonian nationals were airlifted out of Gabon , with the total ultimately reaching 10,000 . In turn , Gabon recalled 100 or so of its nationals studying at the Cameroonian National University in Yaounde. 49 In the midst of all this , Senegal 's President Abdou Diouf was in Libreville on a state visit . Ironically , when Diouf met with Bongo , the latter expressed his satisfaction with the comportment of the 5,000-strong Senegalese community in Gabon , stating that " African peoples must stand together . " 50 The State Steps In : Bongo 's 1985 Attacks on the Lebanese Community <p> At the end of 1984 , President Bongo initiated his most blatant attempt to manipulate the xenophobic tendencies of Gabonese citizens . In an address to the PDG 's Political Bureau , he cited immigration as a problem that had to be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Gabonese gendarmerie at the end of January 1985 ( which was subsequently published in L'Union ) , Bongo let loose a burst of antiforeign invective. 51 He first targeted prostitutes , claiming that all the women plying this trade in Libreville were foreigners . He authorized the gendarmerie to send out trucks to round up these women and then rather crudely suggested , " Then we will leave them to the army . Once five or six soldiers have been on top of them , perhaps they will understand that we do n't tolerate streetwalking in Gabon . " 52 <p> Next he moved to attack immigrants who " enter Gabon and leave as they wish , " spreading " disharmony among Gabonese " and " murdering the national economy . " 53 It was perhaps no coincidence that 1985 marked the beginning of a serious decline in the Gabonese economy from which it has yet to fully recover . This time , the Lebanese community was singled out for cheating the Gabonese population by not paying customs duties . When similar accusations had been made against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanese nationals. 54 The consequences were more serious this time , however . Immediately after the speech , Libreville mobs began pillaging Lebanese stores , and Bongo was obliged to issue a communique calling for calm. 55 <p> The Lebanese community in Gabon ( with an estimated population of only 600 ) , was not Bongo 's real worry . Rather , he feared the development of a large foreign underclass of beggars and unemployed as immigrant workers opted to stay in Gabon despite its economic decline because prospects in their home countries were even more dismal . Beginning in 1985 , Gabonese authorities began to control more rigorously the immigrant population , conducting systematic identity checks and arresting those whose papers were not in order . In May the borders were closed to facilitate a census of all foreigners . Simultaneously it was announced that new bureaucratic measures would be instituted in 1986 to establish residence status and to distribute work permits . In addition , the government launched a campaign of " Gabonization " of both public and private employment. 56 <p> As planned , new residence cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of research at a cost of several million dollars produced a card that was supposed to be impossible to forge . The card could be obtained for CFA 50,000 ( 50,000 African Financial Community francs , about U.S.$200 ) after receiving a work permit from the Ministry of Labor . Immigrants were also obliged to pay a repatriation fee equivalent to the price of a return ticket to their home countries , and an additional charge of 20 percent was tacked on for administrative costs . If immigrant workers desired to visit their home countries and then return to Gabon , they would have to pay another CFA 250,000 ( about U.S.$1,000 ) . 57 These bureaucratic measures indicated a shift in strategy of the Gabonese state -- namely , attempts to control the immigrant population were becoming more institutionalized . From 1986 to the present , bureaucratic instruments of the state , rather than volatile and destructive mobs , would play a more central role in strengthening Gabonese citizenship . <p> Although the more than 100,000 African immigrants in Gabon were alarmed by the exorbitant costs of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought under control . In a speech to the PDG Central Committee shortly after announcing these measures , he stated : " We can not go on entrusting our destiny to foreigners , however honest they may be . " 58 Bongo reiterated that the immigration situation was out of control and once again called for a census and registration of the foreign community , threatening illegal immigrants with deportation . In addition , he accused European residents in Gabon of having racist attitudes and the Lebanese community of engaging in corruption . Furthermore , Bongo blamed the African immigrant community for an increase in crime and the spread of various kinds of sorcery . The immigrant registration program advanced in fits and starts . In June 1988 a thorough street-level search to check for new residence cards and work permits resulted in the deportation of 2,500 illegal aliens. 59 Nonetheless , these actions failed to have any impact on growing unemployment among Gabonese , which was becoming a serious political liability for the Bongo regime as it entered the 1990s . Into the 1990s : Citizens Challenge the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures to control government led to unprecedented political instability as the new decade began . The year 1989 had witnessed the return of exiled MORENA opposition figure Father Paul Mba-Abessole , as well as the uncovering of two plots by well-placed government officials who sought to overthrow the Bongo regime . In 1990 , the Libreville crowd turned the tables on the government and exercised its citizenship rights by attacking the symbols of excess associated with Gabonese political elites . The foreign community did not escape unscathed , as Lebanese enterprises continued to be targeted during the unrest . But it was clear that this violent mob was acting in a very different manner and in very different circumstances than in previous years. 60 <p> The wave of demonstrations and strikes began on 16 January 1990 as students at Omar Bongo University in Libreville protested the deteriorating state of the campus and its facilities . The following day police moved in to evict the students and occupy the campus . On 18 January secondary school students struck in solidarity , and then the general public also joined their protests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 Lebanese businesses were damaged and several store owners were injured . As the spirit of rebellion spread , strikes in both the public and private sectors brought all activity in Libreville to a virtual standstill . The crisis peaked in the final days of February when airport personnel , telecommunication workers , and gas station attendants added their numbers to striking teachers and physicians , each sector demanding higher salaries and better working conditions . The diverse array of public and private sector workers engaging in labor strikes indicated that the Gabonese sense of entitlement -- the foundation of Gabonese citizenship -- was faced with a serious threat . As economic privilege declined for average citizens , their lack of political rights was highlighted , making the unrest particularly acute ( not to mention that these developments occurred just months after the French Revolution 's bicentennial celebration ) . The ritual of mob violence now directed its rage toward the Gabonese state , and the government was forced to react . <p> The unrest pushed Bongo to dissolve the ruling PDG and organize a national conference in March 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 Bongo however , was able to ride out this rough patch and successfully manipulate his victory in the 1993 presidential elections . As the 1990s draw to a close and he enters his fifth decade as head of state , Omar Bongo continues to master the system in a new age of " ambiguous democracy . " 62 <p> Although Gabonese citizens are no longer quite as apt to define themselves in opposition to the foreign community , the large number of immigrants continues to be seen as a serious cause of instability . Since 1986 , the Gabonese state has focused on closing the petite porte to those foreign workers at the lower end of the economic scale . In the succeeding decade , Gabonese security forces have ordered several expulsions of illegal immigrants ( mostly Nigerian nationals ) , and there have been reports of human rights violations against foreign workers. 63 This is an intractable problem because the once-expelled illegal immigrants often return to Gabon from Nigeria via dangerous ocean routes in open boats . Indeed , the potential for tragedy has been great . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationals accused of being illegal immigrants -- suffocated to death in an overcrowded cell in a Libreville detention center. 64 <p> A new plan was announced in September 1994 whereby illegal immigrants in Gabon would have until 31 January 1995 to obtain proper residence papers or be expelled . By the end of 1994 , thousands of immigrant workers , fearing violence after the deadline , gathered without incident in Libreville and at Gabon 's border posts with Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon to return home . As 31 January approached the Gabonese government extended the deadline to 15 February , and , as the latter deadline passed , papers for a number of cases were still being processed . Nonetheless , as of early March , an estimated 64,000 foreigners had left Gabon in relative calm . The bureaucratic instruments of the state had in effect replaced the Libreville mob. 65 <p> In the ironic pattern that followed previous expulsions , everyday life in Libreville became more difficult. 66 A report from mid-February stated : <p> Taxis are rare and this hurts businesses whose employees now arrive late to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fisherman were exclusively Nigerians or West Africans . In the popular quartiers , a number of shops , the majority run by Malians , have closed up. 67 <p> One journalist predicted serious economic and social repercussions in Gabon , noting that <p> according to popular imagery , the Gabonese is seated on a throne ; he has a Ghanaian to shine his shoes , a Beninois to drive him around in a taxi , a Cameroonian to sell him things to eat , and an " Equato " ( Equatorial Guinean ) to take care of his household . ... 68 <p> There was a sense that these days had come to an end , and the Gabonese government attempted to make this clear in a series of pronouncements once again stressing " Gabonization " and encouraging Gabonese citizens to work hard and enter jobs they had previously snubbed . <p> A shift does seem to have occurred ; long-term economic hardship has severely damaged the sense of economic entitlement that had been so important to Gabonese citizenship from the 1960s through the 1980s . Prime Minister Paulin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one where " we have been too used to the good life . It is time that we take action ; the Providential state is finished . " Then , reflecting upon transportation in Libreville , he asked , " The whole taxi transport network is in the hands of foreigners . Do you find that normal ? " He concluded by noting that France won the Battle of the Marne in 1914 " with Parisian taxis , because the taxi drivers were French . " 69 <p> Nguema 's final remark is revealing and speaks volumes about the nature of the French influence in Gabon and about Gabonese ideals of citizenship . Yet the nature of French influence in 1995 was not the same as that in 1964 . In the middle of the government campaign against illegal immigrants , a mysterious group known as the " Committee of the Libreville Unemployed " distributed tracts throughout the city threatening that if the order for expulsion was not applied by the indicated date , " every foreigner living in the popular quartiers and whose papers were not in order will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Libreville will be taken hostage and progressively killed . " 70 By 1995 , the Gabonese sense of citizenship had become strong enough to issue threats against what had always been the most important foreign community in their midst -- the French . <p> Under Bongo 's repressive rule in the 1970s and 1980s , niches existed where Gabonese people were able to construct a sense of citizenship -- usually at the expense of the foreign community -- and ultimately to challenge seriously the president 's survival in the early 1990s . The state 's connivance with the Libreville crowd or general mob backfired , first in 1990 and then again following the flawed presidential elections in 1993 as the mobs turned their violence on the state itself. 71 They also directly attacked the French presence for the first time . <p> The most dramatic developments of 1990 occurred in Port-Gentil at the end of May following the mysterious death of opposition leader Joseph Rendjambe . Amid the rioting , several French businesspeople and diplomats were held hostage , and French troops were obliged to intervene and evacuate French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect its citizens , it also effectively kept Bongo in power , though demonstrating that he had lost control of the situation. 72 Paris subsequently undertook to mediate differences between Bongo and elements of the political opposition . The neocolonial relationship remains , as was made clear during the 1993 presidential elections when French " electoral experts " from their Ministry of the Interior helped to falsify the results in Bongo 's favor. 73 At first glance , it would appear that " plus ca change ... " ; but this would be denying the real evolution of Gabonese citizenship and its influence in bringing about the reforms -- albeit incomplete -- of the 1990s . It would also deny Gabonese citizens ' new-found ability to question France 's dominant position in the politics of their country . <p> As often happens , events may be running ahead of the special Franco-Gabonese relationship . By August of 1997 , it appeared that the realignment of France 's relationship with its former African colonies ( as proposed in the early days of Mitterand 's presidency ) might now actually occur under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( the former Zaire ) , as well as rebellions in the Central African Republic and Congo-Brazzaville , have undermined the diverse networks through which French policy in Africa often operated in cloak and dagger fashion . Omar Bongo remains one of the last figures of the old order and has in effect become the senior spokesman for " Parisnoia , " as evidenced by comments he made at the end of June 1997 : <p> I think there exists a plot at the moment against Francophone Africa . How else can you explain that the slightest spark in this part of the continent is immediately fanned ? ... Francophone countries of Africa have understood the meaning of democracy but that is far from the case for their English-speaking counterparts , where multiparty systems do n't exist . Is n't it strange that no voice denounces that state of affairs ? 74 Conclusion <p> Bongo 's claim that only Francophone African regimes " have understood the meaning of democracy " implies that it is these regimes ' privileged access to the legacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed democracies and citizens than other African countries . His point is made in reference to democratic reforms undertaken in the wake of Mitterand 's pronouncements about aid and democracy at the 1990 Franco-African summit in La Baule . Yet in the Gabonese context these reforms were a consequence of Gabonese citizens exercising their power by taking to the streets to attack the privileges of Gabonese and French elites . This citizenship was largely forged through a series of informal transactions -- indeed , connivances -- between the state and its citizens that targeted different foreign populations for xenophobic attack between 1962 and 1990 . The experience of mob violence not only served to crystallize Gabonese citizenship around a sense of economic entitlement , but also established a pattern of citizenship politics that would target the state in the 1990s . Perhaps most significant , however , Gabonese citizens ( though not the Gabonese political class ) have gained sufficient strength to stridently confront the fundamental issue of their country 's neocolonial relationship to France . <p>

@@5026141 # Although teachers are accustomed to scaffolding students for success , teachers can and should also scaffold for failure by helping students develop a growth mindset in the context of engineering and beyond ( Dweck 2008 ) . When students enact this growth mindset , they learn from their setbacks and come to see that failures are opportunities to learn where and how we can grow and improve . # In this article , we share strategies on how teachers can support students as they develop productive responses to failure within engineering design experiences . Design failure is neither rare nor something to be avoided as students engage in science-integrated engineering design challenges as a part of the Next Generation Science Standards ( NGSS Lead States 2013 ) . In high-quality engineering education , students use an engineering design process ( EDP ) when they engage in design challenges ( NAE and NRC 2009 ) . There are many EDPs used in elementary classrooms ; some crafted for younger or older elementary students , and others developed for particular engineering curricula ( e.g. , Engineering is Elementary 2018 ) . What these EDPs have in common is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve problems ; and # * have a built-in assumption that early designs are likely to fail , so it is necessary to try not just once but multiple times to solve the problem . # We see evidence of this second point in steps like " Improve " or " Try Again " in EDPs ( e.g. , see two different EDPs in Table 1 ) . # For the last five years , we have investigated the responses of upper-elementary students and teachers regarding their experiences with engineering design failure and have asked them about how they use and think about failure terms ( e.g. , fail , failed , failure ) . We are often asked , " What advice do you have for teachers based on your research ? " Although our study continues , we have some answers to this question . We have summarized these into 10 suggestions organized into two sections : # 1 . suggestions about fail words and their meanings ; and # 2. suggestions about preparing students for design failure and helping them respond to it during the EDP. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Staying Alive ! " ( see NSTA Connection ) to put these tips into context . Although the teacher in the vignette , Mrs. Klein , is fictional , she is an amalgamation of the excellent teachers we observed and from which we learned over the years . # FAIL WORDS AND THEIR MEANINGS # 1 . Have explicit discussions with students about fail words and their meanings in different contexts . # Our interviews with students suggest that by the time students are in their upper elementary years , it is quite likely that they have heard or used fail words both in and outside of school . Teachers , coaches , parents , and others have used fail words in their presence , and many have used fail words themselves . In examples provided by students , fail words were used to indicate that something did not work or go as planned ( e.g. , a goalie was unable to stop a ball from going into the goal ) , or less often , that someone was a failure . # Before using fail words in engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail words and their meanings . Teachers might start by asking students in a whole-class discussion what fail words they have heard and what " fail " means in those contexts , and then present the specific way in which fail words are used by engineers and will be used in the context of engineering design challenges in the classroom ( see #2 ) . # 2 . Present a definition of design failure as : when a design does not perform against one or more criteria . # For engineers , design failure is about how a design performs against criteria , the standards used to determine the success or failure of the design . Those criteria are typically established prior to the development or testing of that design . For example , before designing a system to clean up an oil spill on a model river , students understand that the criteria include : # 1 ) that less oil on the water 's surface , as measured by a particular tool , is better ; # 2 ) that less oil on the shoreline , as measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) that less expensive clean-up processes are preferable ( EiE 2018 ) . # A design failure may occur , for example , if too much oil reaches the shoreline . Design failures are determined objectively and are closely connected to criteria . In this way , they provide valuable information about how a design may be improved . # 3 . Always associate failure and fail words with designs and criteria , not with students or teams . # Early in our research , we asked elementary teachers if they used fail words in their classrooms . An overwhelming majority of teachers did not , or only used the words rarely and with respect to ideas about studying so as not to fail a test . In interviews , teachers shared that they avoided using fail words because they worried that students would internalize them , taking on failure identities ( e.g. , thinking that " I failed " or " I am a failure " ) . Even though teachers who taught engineering design challenges for two years became more comfortable using fail words and helping students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may adopt failure identities . For this reason , we urge teachers to explicitly refer to design failure , not team or student failure . For example , a question to ask after the design testing process would be : " Did any of the designs fail to meet criteria ? " rather than " Did any teams fail ? " # 4 . Avoid cliches about failure to avoid confusing students . # We have seen multiple classroom posters about failure and heard many failure cliches in our work in schools . Although the intent of using them is meant to be positive , cliches can be problematic . Three examples are as follows : # Failure Is Not an Option : Failure is indeed an option -- and a normal and informative one -- in the context of engineering design failure . One need only look to the multiple failures of the SpaceX program , headed by Elon Musk , to see that failure happens , informs future work , and gets the company closer to the possibility of reusable rockets to deliver goods to the space station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " Failure is not an option " poster eventually took it down after realizing its message was not consistent with the idea that failure is normal and informs next steps in engineering ( and in life ) . # You Only Fail if You Quit : Another teacher repeatedly told students that they only fail if they give up to encourage them to persevere . Although this was intended to be motivational , student interviews revealed that this presented a confusing message . One team , for example , could not come to consensus about whether their design failed because : ( 1 ) their design did fail to meet criteria , but ( 2 ) they tried again to improve their design ( i.e. , did n't give up , and thus according to their teacher , did not fail ) . # FAIL = First Attempt in Learning : The problem with this acronym is that quite often , engineering designs fail subsequent times , too , as some teams in our studies discovered . Having a design fail more than once is quite normal . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 408 designs failed ( Formula 409 2017 ) ! # 5 . Differentiate design failures from mistakes . # It may be tempting to associate design failures with mistakes . In the process of learning , students regularly make mistakes in their work , learn from those mistakes , and then improve their work . However , engineering design failures are not the same as mistakes . Mistakes are typically regarded as errors in getting to the right answer ; once fixed , the right answer is achieved . The design process expects that design failures will not only occur but will provide valuable information to improve subsequent designs . In addition , there is no one correct answer in engineering design ; there are multiple ways to solve a problem . # PREPARING FOR AND RESPONDING TO DESIGN FAILURE WITHIN THE EDP # 6 . Remind students about constraints , criteria , and testing procedures before the design process . Model proper testing procedures and discuss why they 're important . # The constraints of an engineering design challenge are the limitations or restrictions placed on the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Criteria inform students about how to create a successful design . Designs are often tested to inform criteria ( e.g. , a model bridge is tested by piling weights on top of the bridge until it fails ) . To ensure that students understand the constraints , criteria , and testing process , engage in discussions about these design elements before students begin to brainstorm or plan their designs and before they test their designs . Teachers can also model design-testing procedures for students . If students and teams do not follow the constraints , criteria , and testing processes , it will be difficult for them to accurately assess whether their design failed or succeeded to meet the criteria . # 7 . Prepare students for the likelihood that designs may fail , and that this is a normal part of engineering . # Prior to design testing , remind students that in engineering , it is normal for first and early design attempts to fail to meet criteria . Likewise , teachers should reference the EDP to show students that it allows for design failure because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovating , which means that engineers often do not have a quick path to a successful answer . # 8 . Be prepared for a wide range of student responses to failure , both positive and negative . # Students ' negative responses to design failure included blaming other team members or making changes to the design without careful thought or planning . However , students also had many positive responses to design failures , including engaging in failure analysis and focusing on how to improve . See Table 2 for a summary of both categories of responses . Be prepared for this range of responses so that you can anticipate how you might or might not intervene . # 9 . Do not intervene . Give students time to work through their own productive responses to design failure . # Students must try to " work it out " for themselves when confronted with a design failure . Teachers from our study talked about the need to let students work together as a team as they consider and analyze the failure , and then figure out how to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pausing , and listening -- but did not always intervene to allow students to make progress in the design process . Even initially negative responses to failure , such as frustration , could be worked out without teacher interventions to allow students to move toward more productive responses . # 10 . Intervene when student teams become stuck on a design failure , # During teachers ' monitoring of teams during and after the testing process , it became evident that some students and teams had become " stuck " in a negative response . In these instances , teachers ' primary strategy was to intervene with the following questions to move teams in more productive directions . Students were : # * prompted to engage in failure analysis and consider how to improve ( e.g. , What were your testing results ? How can you improve in your next design ? ) ; # * encouraged to be considerate to their peers , and to use peers within and outside of their team as resources ( e.g. , What do each of you think ? How did other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and # * provided help to make connections to critical background information ( e.g. , What did we learn about the needs of plants earlier in the unit that might inform your design of your plant package ? ) . # Additionally , teachers reminded students that it is okay that their design failed to meet criteria and that the EDP enables them to improve . Finally , in rare situations when questioning strategies did not work , teachers described that they provided more direct advice to student teams when they were stuck or frustrated . This direct guidance ( e.g. , focus on improving your bridge supports ) was a last resort to help student teams move forward in the design process . # DEVELOPING A GROWTH MINDSET BEYOND ENGINEERING # The above suggestions come from our work in science-integrated engineering education . However , the big growth mindset idea here -- that failure is normal and gives us feedback about how to improve -- can be applied to other subject areas and to life , in general . We observed this in our study , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This big idea about failure and improvement began to be interwoven throughout the school day : in science , mathematics , literacy , and other areas of instruction . # REFERENCES # Dweck , C.S. 2008 .

@@4119041 Based on NAEP data , many adolescents may not be adequately prepared for postsecondary education . This is a Year Five report from a seven-year longitudinal study of a student cohort starting in sixth grade year ( n=50 ) . It uses a quasi-experimental design , and collects data from surveys , interviews , and reflective statements to evaluate mentoring strategies and outcomes . Year Five findings suggest that improvements in students ' college perceptions , state mandated test scores , and high school perseverance may be associated with mentor-led initiatives including college visits , goal setting , tutoring , career investigations , role model presentations , writing projects , and presentations about college preparation and life . </p> Reports on the educational attainment of adults and on the college readiness of adolescents provide disturbing news , particularly regarding African-Americans and Hispanic students . Recent data about high school graduation rates indicate that nationally , about 71 percent of all students graduate from high school on time with a regular diploma , but barely half of African-American and Hispanic students earn diplomas with their peers ( Sum , 2009 ) . Each year approximately 1.2 million students fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are categorized as in minority groups ( Diplomas Count , 2009 ) . Students who drop out of high school may have a grim economic future . According to Swanson ( 2003 ) only one-third ( 37 percent ) of high school dropouts nationwide are steadily employed , and they are more than twice as likely to live in poverty . </p> Trends in college readiness education attainment among adolescents are discouraging . Recent NAEP academic achievement reports ( National Assessment Governing Board , n.d. ) indicate only small percentages of eighth graders rank within the ' at or above proficient ' category for various subject areas and a significant gap exists so that Hispanic and African-American groups underachieve when compared to other population groups . The reading , math , and science NAEP scores of young adolescents and the current drop-out rates force the question : how many wiII be ready for college in four years ? Overall the gap in education preparation among Whites , Hispanics , and Blacks , as evident in their scaled scores , will result in many minority students being poorly prepared for higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LITERATURE The need to begin preparation for post-secondary education during middle school has been recognized for a long time , funded nationally , and supported at state and local levels . The literature includes articles , handbooks and guidelines for this process , and calls to action in the case of minority and underserved populations . </p> PLANNING TRANSITION FOR COLLEGE STARTING IN THE MIDDLE GRADES </p> The Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Program ( GEAR UP ) was created in 1998 and provides college-planning activities and related information to students , typically starting in middle school , and helps build relationships among school districts , colleges , and other community stakeholders . Based on site visits to 20 GEAR UP partnerships and descriptive information from 1 8 schools , Muraskin ( 2003 ) reported that tutoring was the most common type of support . In their " Year 4 " baseline report , conducted in north-central West Virginia , Finch and Cowley ( 2003 b ) summarized that tenth graders ' postsecondary plans had been positively influenced by the GEAR UP program . </p> The Federal TRIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared similar academic preparation goals with GEAR UP . TRIO , originally named this because it offered three programs , now includes eight outreach and support programs designed to help low-income , first-generation college students and students who have disabilities , progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to post-baccalaureate programs . </p> Predating GEAR UP are many state and locally funded programs such as Michigan 's Project Awareness and Baltimore 's Early Guidance Model . Flores ( 1993 ) reported that the goal of this Michigan program was to heighten students ' post-secondary aspirations through five interventions . Baltimore City Schools ' Early Guidance Model ( Gray , 1986 ) for middle/junior high school students supported this early post-secondary planning goal and extended it to elementary level students , suggesting that at an early age children need academic encouragement and need to envision going to college . Calls to action concerning the educational needs of minority and underserved populations have been raised for decades . Camblin ( 2003 ) described concerns about underserved students not attending college at the same rate as their White , middle- , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lack of opportunity for underserved students starting in middle school . </p> The " Creating a College Culture Project " ( McClafferty , McDonough , &; Nunez , 2002 ) emerged from concerns about the declining number of college-bound students from a southern California cluster of 24 schools that were ethnically and racially diverse . McClafferty recommended that schools should create a " college culture " : a school culture that encourages all students to consider college by introducing information about higher education opportunities during early adolescence and in high school . This concept of creating a college culture among diverse adolescents , many who are considered " at-risk " of not graduating from high school , underlies our current project which uses mentoring as a key strategy to support at risk students during their middle school and high school years . </p> MENTORING DURING MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL Mentoring , the foundation for creating a college culture in our study , was initiated with a cohort of students in their sixth grade and has supported them from sixth through their current year , tenth grade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ference and Rhodes ( 2002 ) , describing a program very similar to our project , report that a mentoring program for at-risk middle school students at a professional development school site using preservice teachers enrolled in methods classes improved the grades of two-thirds of the young students and was a positive experience for the mentors . Herrera , Vang , and Gale ( 2002 ) investigated three mentoring programs for middle school students and report associated improvements in students ' academic performance and attitudes . </p> After evaluating the impact of mentoring on middle and high school student achievement , attendance , and behavior , Illig ( 1999 ) cautiously suggested that academic mentoring may provide some benefits for children and concludes that additional research is needed . In our study , the cohort of students was mentored by preservice teachers in a variety of educational activities that help create a college culture . Highlights from these mentoring activities include the mentor helping to guide college visits each year during the past five years . As the young students toured the campus the mentors explained how college ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential halls and dining halls , and student athletic facilities . During the first three visits the mentors guided the young students through a writing marathon process ( Radcliffe &; Stephens , 2010 ) in which the students wrote reflections as they toured campus . Another writing activity guided by the mentors involved helping the students write digital stories about how to be successful in school and also about their future career plans . To help the young adolescents pass critical , state mandated tests in eighth grade the preservice teachers provided year-long tutoring in language arts and mathematics . Typically one mentor worked with two students throughout the semester , coaching them twice each week in half hour sessions . </p> As this cohort of students entered high school we shifted the mentoring focus to helping these students set goals and to sup porting their self-efficacy . Based on goal theory , mentoring should focus on the meaning students attach to achievement situations and the purpose to the actions taken ( Ames , 1992 ; Barker , Dowson &; Mclnerney , 2002 , Martin &; Dowson , 2009 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our study preservice teachers guided high school students in completing a goal orientation survey and discussing the meaning of goals . Within a college bound culture , reasons for engaging in a particular behavior or pursing a particular goal can become clearly defined ( Dowson &; Mclnerney , 2001 ) . Consistent with this the preservice teachers then assisted the high school students in setting short and long term goals that would support success in high school and a college-going future . </p> One of the main objectives in our study was to help the high school students develop high self efficacy . According to Bandura ( 1986,1997 ) , and Schunk and Miller ( 2002 ) , self-belief , motivation , and achievement develop when a caring , goal directed relationship emerges . The social relationship between our students and their preservice teachers became supportive and caring as they participated in weekly conversations , college information presentations , and college tours . The preservice teachers were committed to building a comfortable working relationship with their mentees , much in line with reports from Bandura ( 1986,1997 ) and Schunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and achievement develop when a caring goal directed relationship emerges during mentoring . </p> RESEARCH PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of our seven-year research is to determine if creating a college-going culture through long-term mentoring of academically and economically at-risk students , starting in their sixth grade year and continuing through high school , has a positive impact on these students ' education . Our research question is , " Will a multi-faceted set of mentor-led strategies including college visits , goal setting , tutoring , career investigations , role model presentations , writing projects , and presentations about college preparation and life have a positive effect on students ' aspirations to attend college and their success gaining acceptance by a post-secondary institution ? " These strategies support the over-arching design of this research study , illustrated in Table 1 , Mentoring Goals and Strategies in Middle School by Grade Level ( 6th-8th ) to Support Building a College-Going Culture , which presents five mentoring goals . Plans for continuation of the strategies are included in Table 2 , Mentoring Goals and Strategies in High School by Grade Level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ </p> This Year Five report describes research findings as well as factors and shifts occurring during the first five years of our seven year project that engages pre-service teachers in mentoring students , starting in students ' sixth grade year and continuing though high school , in order to create a college-going culture among the cohort of at-risk students . This report responds to several research questions about mentoring including ( a ) how have the students been supported by pre-service teachers through mentoring initiatives during grades 6-10 ; ( b ) how has this mentoring support changed over the five years ; and ( c ) what is the nature of the relationships between the men-tored students and their mentors ? Two additional research questions focus on broader topics including ; ( d ) how have the students ' perceptions and aspirations about college changed during grades 6-10 ; and ( e ) how do the treatment group and control group students compare in perceptions and aspirations about college , drop-out rates after ninth grade , and scores on state-man dated assessments in a critical college preparation subject : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design involving randomly selected participants for the treatment and control groups , a series of data collection steps over the long term of the study , and data sources that include surveys , interviews , written reflective statements , student projects , and student enrollment and academic performance measures . </p> PARTICIPANTS The participants initially included 1 69 students who attended a rural school district located 10 miles outside of a major metropolitan area . Students in the treatment and control groups entered the study in Fall 2005 , when they were in the sixth grade . The school district 's guidelines for academically and economically at-risk students , which include 13 statutory criteria such as low grades in two foundation subjects , were used to identify students for the study . With the assistance of school administrators , 100 students were randomly selected from the pool of about 120 at-risk students , 50 to serve in the treatment group and 50 to serve in a control group for our quasi-experimental research design . </p> During the first three years of the study , when the subjects were in grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject attrition resulting in a treatment group of 40 students and a control group of 40 students . A third student group , students ( n = 35 ) who were on the school 's Fall 2006 honor roll ( students who achieved all A and B grades ) , served as a second comparison group during the middle school grades . Another middle school comparison group , students who were neither at risk nor on the Fall 2006 honor roll , included 34 students who we have categorized as the routine group . During years four and five of the study , a number of the high school participants withdrew from the high school ( and district ) resulting in 33 treatment group students and 29 control group students at the end of the Fall 2009 semester . The composition of the participants in this study is 60% Hispanic , 30% Anglo , and 7% African-American . </p> The participants also include preservice teachers , typically college juniors and seniors , enrolled in two teacher preparation classes that are taught in a blended approach on the public school campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different group of about 25 to 30 preservice teachers meets twice a week from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the public school campus where the students under study are enrolled . Other participants include the school 's principal , academic dean , and the curriculum coordinator who are active planners and administrators in this project . </p> FIELD PROCEDURES This long term study is being conducted during the students ' normal school day and as part of the preservice teachers ' scheduled professional development courses that are hosted at the public school . Typically the student , or sometimes a pair of students , and a preservice teacher work together in a school classroom.The list and timetable for mentoring activities are illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 which describe mentoring goals and strategies by grade levels ( 6th-8th ) , and grade levels ( 9th-12th ) respectively . Parent permission signatures are collected for students ' participation in the project , and for each college visit . The school provides bus transportation for the students ' visit to the college which is conducted as an all-day field trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools including written self-surveys , structured written reflective reports , structured interviews , and digital stories prepared with Microsoft PowerPoint . School records were a source for students ' scores on the state mandated TAKS test ( Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills ) , and allowed tracking students ' annual registration in the school district , an indicator of attendance and drop-out trends . </p> Each year we investigated students ' perceptions about college through written surveys that included 11 Likert-type questions such as " How difficult do you think getting accepted into college is ? " The surveys allowed us to compare treatment group students ' college perceptions as they progressed through several grades in the study , and also to compare the treatment group 's responses to the survey results of the control , routine , and honor roll groups . Data was collected directly from the treatment group students about their college perceptions through an on-line survey created in www.survey-monkey.com . The survey questions included " What is the most important thing to do now in order to attend college later ? " </p> During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students created three digital stories , responding to three different prompts including " Describe an interest or positive experience at school " , " What career or job do you want during your twenties ? " , and " What must students do to be successful in middle school ? " The content of the stories provided insight into students ' career goals and perceptions of how to get there . </p> The treatment group students were interviewed by the preservice teachers to investigate their experiences with their college campus tour . An example question is " What is one thing you remember about your visit ? " We also collected the preservice teachers ' written reflections about the tours . At the end of the second year of the study we used an unstructured interview approach with the principal to explore her perceptions of the need for the study , the impacts of the research project components , and the benefits for her students . </p> During the treatment groups ' eighth grade year , when the mentoring support focused on tutoring the students in preparation for the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a critical college preparation content area : math . In response to the high school principal 's suggestion , support for the students shifted in their ninth grade year to individual mentoring , focused on defining short and long term goals . Data about the students ' goal orientation was collected from the cohort of students using the Manual for the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales ( Midgley , et a I. , 2000 ) to formulate our questions . </p> DATA ANALYSIS The hand written and online surveys included Likert-like questions , each with five response options . As an example , the question " How difficult do you think getting accepted into college is ? " included five response options ranging from " not so difficult " to " too difficult for me " . Responses were analyzed using SPSS ( Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ) statistical test software to determine mean scores and to analyze variation among groups . Higher mean scores were interpreted to suggest higher aspirations or more positive perceptions regarding college-going issues . For the state TAKS assessment , group mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in the treatment group and the control group . Chart 1 , Students ' Math Scores by Year , graphs the groups ' scores . </p> The responses to questions on structured written surveys and interviews were reviewed by the authors who looked for repetition of terms or statements . For example , a tally of responses to the question " How did the visit to the university impact the students ' perceptions about attending a university ? " netted eight responses that included " excited " , five responses stating " enjoyed it " , four responses indicating " interested " , two responses of " overwhelmed " , and so on . The authors reported their consensus on the collective meaning of such data . For example , in the above case the authors concluded that students had positive perceptions . </p> FINDINGS Our findings are organized by the following five research questions . How have the students been mentored , and how did this support our project goals ? </p> The timetable and types of mentoring support are outlined in Table 1 , Mentoring Goals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Support Building a College-Going Culture , and in Table 2 which describes subsequent support in high school . In summary the mentors hosted the students on college tours each Spring during which the students attended college classes and presentations about college admission and financial aid procedures . A significant mentoring effort during the tours was the preservice teachers ' initiative in guiding the students to reflect on their experiences of college through a writing marathon approach . The students ' responses on follow-up surveys , which indicated that they gained positive perceptions of college , support our project goals numbered one through three ( Table I ) . </p> During their eighth grade year , the students ' mentors tutored them in preparation for the state mandated TAKS test . Based on the mentor 's content strength in language arts or mathematics , the mentors individually tutored students who were weak in either language arts or mathematics . This significant mentoring initiative may have contributed to all of the students passing their TAKS tests , which also supports our project goal number four ( Table I ) . </p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped the students set short and long term goals that support success in high school and a college-going future . Once every other week for at least thirty minutes , the mentors met with their student(s) to discuss the students ' goals and progress . The principal stated that this mentoring initiative was very important to insuring that the students stayed in school . Noteworthy , fewer of the mentored students withdrew from school as compared to the control group students . This outcome is critical to supporting all of our project goals . </p> How HAS THIS MENTORING SUPPORT CHANGED OVER THE FIVE YEARS ? The nature of the college visits has changed in three ways . With each annual visit we reduced the structure for the visit in terms of a defined , detailed plan of specific places to visit and a timetable for each visit stop . Related to this we gave more power to the young students to select where they wanted to tour and how long they wanted to spend at each tour stop . Finally , we increased the tour 's emphasis on presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nature of residential life . </p> The type of support for the young students shifted during their sixth through tenth grade years as the students matured and their school setting changed . Mentoring during their sixth and seventh grade years addressed helping them explore future career interests , recognize the importance of education to their future , and discover the nature of college . Mentor support during the students ' eighth grade was shifted at the request of the middle school principal who asked that the mentors tutor the students in mathematics and language arts to help them pass the state mandated eighth grade TAKS test . </p> The mentoring support shifted again in ninth grade at the suggestion of the high school principal who requested that the mentors help support the ninth grade students ' adjustment to the rigors of high school life . Specifically the support focused on one-on-one mentoring that in ninth grade addressed helping the students find a niche in high school , and then expanded during ninth and tenth grade into setting short and long term goals that support success in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of presentations about college shifted after the students entered high school . During their middle school years college information had been presented only once a year , when the young students were on a college campus tour . Starting in ninth grade we hosted several college presentations each year at the high school . For example , during one semester preservice teachers presented on the topic of ' college student athletes ' . </p> The schedules for meetings between the students and their mentors became more flexible after the students entered high school . During their middle school years the young students met twice a week with their mentor during their first period at school . In high school the students and mentors met during several lunch meetings each semester . In addition , the students were able to meet with their mentor in one of the student 's daily classes where the mentor was scheduled to fulfill preservice teacher assignments . </p> The final shift in mentoring involved a gradual reduction in our role as researchers to structure the mentoring role . The mentoring role during middle school was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The preservice teachers ' professor closely guided their mentoring efforts , and required a product such as the young students ' digital stories . This locus of control shifted in high school to a more flexible and individualized mentoring approach where during lunch and/or in a morning class the high school student and mentor met to identify goals and discuss how to achieve them . </p> WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MENTORED STUDENTS AND THEIR MENTORS ? </p> During the students ' sixth through eighth grade years , the mentors followed a teaching role . They helped their young charges learn how to write a digital story , how to engage in a writing marathon , and how to complete language arts or mathematics homework assignments . The relationships between mentors and the middle school students were typically trusting , respectful , and individualized . The students often showed pride in working with a mentor ; sometimes the middle school students would point out to their peers : " there 's my mentor . " </p> Positive relationships continued in high school where the ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college student , their mentor . Students were accustomed to seeing mentors in their school and were comfortable talking to them . Mentors were amazed at how open and accepting their mentees appeared . Students shared their interests , accomplishments in sports , their success or lack of success in classes , and how they saw themselves in the future . The mentor-mentee relationship became causal and supportive where mentors showed interests in how the student was adjusting to high school , whether they had found supportive friends , and if they were involved in athletics or belonged to a club . </p> HOW HAVE THE STUDENTS ' COLLEGE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS CHANGED DURING GRADES 7-10 ? </p> The impact of the project on the treatment group students ' perceptions about college based on a survey administered in 7th , 8th , 9th and 10th grade about college perceptions , revealed that these students initially had positive perceptions , and that these perceptions became more positive . The difference , using paired samples , between the mean scores of the 31 students who took the survey during 7th and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p = .02 , with the 8th grade scores ( M = 43 ) exceeding the 7th grade scores ( M = 41 ) . The difference between the mean scores of the 24 students who took the same survey during the 8th and 9th grades was also statistically significant , ( 23 ) = -2.07 , p = .050 , with the 9th grade scores ( M = 44 ) exceeding the 8th grade scores ( M = 42 ) . The mean scores of the 19 students who took the survey during the 9th and 10th grades was not statistically significant , t(18) = .09 , p = .93 , with the 10th grade scores ( M = 45 ) equivalent to the 9th grade scores ( M = 45 ) . </p> The four-point gain in scores ( 10% ) over the span of four surveys has some practical significance . A mean score above 33 is interpreted as suggesting a positive perception about college . Supporting this , the preservice teachers who mentored the students consistently reported that the students were positive about the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN THEIR COLLEGE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS , THEIR MATH SCORES ON STATE-MANDATED ASSESSMENTS , AND THEIR DROP-OUT RATES AFTER 9TH GRADE ? </p> Surveys administered at the end of eighth grade revealed that the treatment group students ' perceptions about college were more positive than the perceptions of students in the control , routine , and honor roll groups . The treatment group had the highest mean score on the survey ( M = 44 ) , followed by the honor roll group ( M = 42 ) , the routine group ( M = 40 ) , and the control group ( M = 39 ) . A NOVA test results for differences in perceptions of treatment , control , routine , and honor roll groups revealed a statistically significant difference , F ( 3,133 ) = 4.1 73 , p = .007 , in mean scores for the groups . Tukey HSD post-hoc tests suggested that treatment students ' perceptions about college were more positive than the control group 's . </p> During the first two years of high school a number of students stopped attending high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher attrition than the treatment group . School and district enrollment records revealed that seven of the forty treatment group students , representing 17594 of their group withdrew from the school . They are not attending school elsewhere in the district . Eleven of the forty control group student , representing 28.5% of their group , withdrew and are not attending school in the district </p> Tracking of students math scores on the state mandated TAKS assessment at the end of 7th , 8th and 9th grade ? revealed rising scores for the treatment group and declining scores for the control group as illustrated in Chart 1 , Students ' Math Scores by Year </p> DISCUSSON OF FINDINGS RELATED TO SHIFTS IN MENTORING AND OUTCOME PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS HAVE PERFORMED A VARIETY OF MENTORINO ROLES . </p> The pre-service teachers performed five different roles , charging their roles in response to the students needs and level of maturity . Initially they as sumed the role of a teacher , helping the student in sixth and seventh grades learn how to write a digital story and how to engage in a writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide , declined in the level of authority as the students matured . Mentors fed the college tours when the student were in the sixth and seventh grades , they fecilitated the tours when the students became eighth graders , and finally they served as tour chaperones after the students entered high school . During the students ' eighth grade the pre-service teachers ' key role was to tutor the students in preparation for their state-mandated math and language arts assessments . When the students entered high school the pre-service teachers assumed a distinctly different role , to help the students set short and long term goals , and to coach them on how to find a niche in high school . Throughout the mentoring of students during their sixth-tenth grade years , the pre-service teachers regularly acted as a role model in both formal approaches , such as giving a presentation about being a college athlete , and in less formal approaches including daily discussions about how to be successful in school and the importance of college . </p> MANY FACTORS HAVE INFLUENCED THE NEED TO CHANGE MENTORING ROLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college tours changed due to three factors . As the young students matured and became more familiar with the nature of a college campus they needed less structure to guide their visit . After several tours , students gained specific interests in the college campus which led them to choose their visit stops . Finally , as the young students became more familiar with the nature of college life , they developed interests and concerns in some of the challenging aspects such as admission procedures , financial aid needs , and residential hall life-styles . In response to this , we added presentations about these topics to the college tour agenda . </p> The support for the young students shifted to tutoring during their eighth grade year because of a critical factor . These young students had to pass the state-man dated TAKS assessment modules in order to be accepted into high school . Mentoring support changed again as the students entered ninth grade because of another critical factor . These students needed support to help insure that they stayed in high school rather than dropping out . Their high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals that would sustain them in high school and that they might not find a high school niche that would help them develop a sense of belongingness and identity . In response the pre-service teachers focused their mentoring support on goal-setting with the ninth graders . </p> Starting in high school , mentoring opportunities to learn about college were expanded from the pre-service teachers leading an annual college tour to giving presentations at the high school about college life . The factor causing this change is that when students progress to high school their need to know about college admissions and financial aid becomes more acute and relevant to setting academic goals , student activity goals , and after-school employment goals . </p> In high school , the meetings between ninth graders and preservice teachers became less compulsory because unlike the middle school 's schedule which included a daily advisory period , there was no slot in the high school schedule other than a lunch period during which all ninth graders and all preservice teachers could meet . Also , unlike the middle school where attendance in the daily advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with a preservice teacher during lunch was a voluntary decision by the ninth grader . Because meetings were not compulsory in ninth grade it became important to motivate the ninth graders to meet by offering a series of pizza lunch meetings during which the students and their mentors met . In the tenth grade we were able to improve on structuring meetings by assigning the student 's mentor to a classroom that the student attended daily . </p> The mentoring role shifted from being highly structured in terms of tasks and schedules which were designed by the pre-service teachers ' professors and were product oriented , to a more individualized mentoring approach because the needs of the students were changing . In middle school , young students need an organized introduction to college because they are very uninformed about college . Our structured , guided , and product oriented approach helped introduce the middle school students to the nature of college . However , as the students gained knowledge about college and also entered high school where they began to be confronted with their individual future after graduation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beginning in high school the preservice teachers met individually with their ninth graders to discuss individual goals and how to achieve them . </p> RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MENTORS AND MENTEES CHANGED FOR SEVERAL REASONS </p> The relationship between mentors and mentees shifted over five years as the young adolescents matriculated from sixth graders to tenth graders . As twelve-year-old youngsters the mentees ' relationship with their mentors was a student to teacher relationship in which the preservice teacher presented instruction and led college campus tours . Over the course of five years this evolved to a more casual adolescent to adult-model relationship in which the preservice teacher helped their mentee set goals , shared college experiences , and chaperoned college campus tours . Of the five factors that caused this shift the most significant was the growing maturity of the mentees in terms of social , emotional , physical , and intellectual characteristics . A related factor was the closing of the age gap between mentees and mentors . The age of the mentors remained constant since each semester new mentors , typically 21- or 22-year-old preservice teachers , rotated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program at age 12 were 16 years old at the end of the fifth year of the study . Both factors , the mentees ' growing maturity and the closing of this age gap , led to less formality and authority in the mentoring relationship . Contributing to this relaxation in the relationship was the third factor , the intentional shift in the program from emphasizing instruction and tutoring by the mentors to concentrating on individualized goal-setting support from the mentors . Another factor , the shift in climate from a middle school to a high school setting , created a more grown-up setting that encouraged adult-like behavior in the mentees . Finally , after four years of experience in the building a college-going culture program , the mentees gained comfort and understanding in how to relate to their mentoring preservice teachers . </p> The findings of our research suggest that there may be positive relationships between participation in the multiple facets of our building a college-culture program and student outcomes including growth in positive perceptions and aspirations about college , perseverance in school as opposed to withdrawing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors may also influence students ' college perceptions , high school perseverance , and academic scores . For example , students ' perceptions about high school and college may be impacted by discussions with peers and family members , the influence of role models through popular media , college marketing as appearing on the internet , and high school guidance office communications . In addition students ' academic scores on state mandated tests may be impacted by the variety of instruction efforts at school including individualized instruction , summer classes , and tutoring . </p> DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS IN RESPONSE TO FIVE MENTORING GOALS GOAL #7 : STUDENTS WILL UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF COLLEGE </p> Our key strategy for helping students understand the nature of college was escorting them on a day-long campus visit each Spring which involved them in writing about their visit through a writing marathon , allowed them to help plan their visit stops , and engaged them in college information presentations . After participating in several visits it became clear that the students were learning about college based on a review of their writing marathon responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall and was so amazed . I 've never seen a stage like it . It was so much better than the one we have at our school . " In addition they were taking charge of planning the itinerary for their campus walk , asking informed questions during presentations , and demonstrating more insight about college as evident in their post-tour survey responses such as " The classes are huge which is good because there is bound to be one person that can help you . " </p> GOAL #2 : STUDENTS WILL RECOGNIZE THAT A COLLEGE EDUCATION MAY BE IMPORTANT TO THEIR FUTURE SUCCESS </p> Two key strategies for helping students recognize that a college education may be important to their future success included the digital story assignments and the motivational presentations about college , typically presented by currently enrolled college students . Reviews of the students ' digital stories about their future careers revealed that they often described plans for attending college as they shared their vision of developing a career . For example a student explained " want to attend college so I can go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question with a statement indicating commitment to college such as " When I am a college freshman " Finally , students ' aspirations toward college were very evident in their written survey responses such as " want to go here when I am older . I want to be a business owner of a major corporation . " </p> GOAL #3 : STUDENTS WILL GAIN POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS ABOUT COLLEGE </p> In written reflections about the marathons the preservice teachers consistently reported that the students were excited and positive about their visit and about the prospect of college . As previously reported in this report , students ' perceptions about college based on a survey administered in 7th , 8th , 9th and 10th grades about college perceptions revealed that their perceptions became more positive over several years . </p> GOAL #4 : STUDENTS WILL PREPARE ACADEMICALLY FOR COLLEGE ADMISSION </p> A key strategy for helping students prepare academically for college admissions was tutoring them twice per week in mathematics and/or language arts during their eighth grade year . Tutoring during this year was critical to the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessments in order to enter high school and because some high school level college-track type courses are dependent on success in middle school courses , particularly in pre-algebra . Students ' math scores increased as previously illustrated in this report and all students passed the state-mandated tests including math . </p> GOAL #5 : STUDENTS WILL SET SHORT AND LONG TERM GOALS CONSISTENT WITH A COLLEGE-GOING FUTURE . </p> A review of students ' written goals reveals that many of their goals are consistent with a college-going culture . For example one student wrote , " My chosen plan is to go to college , get a bachelors degree in political science , then go to a Texas law school in Houston to be a lawyer . " Another student wrote , " My chosen plan is to graduate high school and maybe take two years of community college and after that decide if I want to take two more at another college or try to a good job . " The mentors also reported that their students were setting goals consistent with going to college . A mentor explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goals included : " high SAT/ACT scores , and acceptance into college . " Another mentor reported that her student 's goals were to improve her GPA and maintain good status at school so that she can apply for college . </p> CONCLUSION The U.S. Department of Labor ( 2005 ) forecasts 13% growth in the national workforce between 2004 and 2014 . Many of the projected jobs will require an associate or four-year college degree . Projections of the attainment of college certificates and degrees among future workers fall short of predicted workforce needs ( National Association of Manufacturers , 2007 ) . The current study is significant because the findings from this study at year five of the seven year term suggest that the project 's many strategies to build a college-going culture through mentoring may be associated with students ' growth in positive perceptions and aspirations about college , perseverance in school as opposed to withdrawing , and improvement in state-mandated assessment scores . These factors may contribute to improving these students ' likelihood of attending college . </p> As this project continues , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and we will continue to adjust the mentoring approaches as appropriate to meet the project 's five mentoring goals and to build a college-going culture . </p> Table 1 .
